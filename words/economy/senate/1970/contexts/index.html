<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing the interest rate is a classical procedure to curb any inflationary tendencies that may be noticed in a prosperous <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the expressed concern of the Government regarding overheating of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will the Government agree to this practical proposal for an inquiry into the necessity for an increase in the prices of these commodities because the increases will affect the whole cost structure of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Treasurer setting out deliberately to wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or is it being done just through inadvertence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an engaging proposition to have to answer a question from the other side of the chamber which refers to the fact that the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> airline grants distinct advantages to its employees over those granted by the airline which is operated by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it is proposed that minor capital works, repairs and maintenance be undertaken by appropriate personnel of the Department of Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree with a statement by the finance industry that these increases are due to the fact that the Commonwealth Government has deliberately pushed up interest rates to try to slow down the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the reason for the Government’s continued refusal  to recognise  the serious position of the Australian canning pea industry and the consequential further weakening of the primary industry sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be a satisfactory position for a country which, as we all know, experiences from lime to time by  the very nature of its <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its dependence on big exports of primary production the hazards of drought and overseas markets, which depends very much upon balance of payment problems flowing out of changes in export income, and which needs to have a strong reserve position and a good international monetary position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this combination is expected to be such as to permit the service to be operated without loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the United Kingdom’s Common Market negotiator, said that New Zealand is facing the most testing period in its economic life and that, without safeguards, British entry into the Common Market would be a disaster for the New Zealand <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister for Primary Industry or the Prime Minister make a statement to the people of Australia, particularly to the Tasmanian farmers who produce and export products similar to those exported by New Zealand and to the same market, outlining the safeguards to be built into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to prevent a similar fate to that feared by New Zealanders befalling the primary producers of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Profit margins, interest rates, taxes and charges all have a direct part in determining cost levels within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, proportionately, can do as much to raise costs as wage movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to promote trade and commerce with other countries and among the States in Australian wool to the advantage of Australian wool growers and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by means directed to encouraging and facilitating the purchase of Australian wool for the purposes of, or in the course of, that trade and commerce, and at the same time securing, in respect of wool purchased for the purposes of, or in the course of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not an economic fact that any cost factor affecting any industry in Australia is reflected ultimately throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including primary industry, so that any increase in the cost of production in any industry in Australia will have an effect upon primary industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall some criticism of mine of the Department of Works which brought forth the reply that the Department could not, on the score of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency, compete with private contractors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unwise and panic measures of the Government in dealing with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which are likely to cause disruption, hardship and to damage the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, will the Minister assure the Senate that in a State such as South Australia where only one Government project may have been envisaged, compared with the position in New South Wales or Victoria where several such projects may have been envisaged, that that one project will not be cancelled or postponed in view of the drastic repercussions of such action on the building industry and in view of the fact that cancellation of one of several projects in a larger State would not be so drastically detrimental to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> campaign now in operation, can the Minister indicate how much the trip will cost and whether it is really necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I point out to the honourable senator how much worse the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> would have been had the Australian Wool Commission not been operating at that and other sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories aware that the desiccated coconut industry in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea employs about 700 persons and makes a highly significant contribution to the Territory’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister any comment on a recent Japanese report on the Chinese <span class="highlight">economy</span> which stated that China will buy no wheat from Australia this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister comment on a recent Japanese report on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Mainland China which stated that China will buy no wheat from Australia this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has expenditure in this department been cut down due to the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive, and what other activities in this Hospital have been cut for the same reason? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it been reported that the senior hostess apologised to some <span class="highlight">economy</span> class passengers for not serving refreshments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Press conference  Mr Dunshea  refused to say whether he thought resale price maintenance was harmful to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has expenditure in the Rehabilitation Department of the Canberra Hospital been cut due to the Federal Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the AttorneyGeneral whether, in view of the decision of the High Court in the concrete pipes case last Friday which held that Commonwealth power to control restrictive trade practices extends to intra-state agreements between companies but not to such restrictive trade agreements between individuals, will he consider the need for an amendment to the Australian Constitution to rectify such an anomalous situation and enable legislation against restrictive trade practices to have full impact over the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Leader of the Government admitted yesterday to what he called an easing of the labour market, what steps does the Government intend to take to boost the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, or are the people suffering the social tragedy of unemployment to be regarded as so many statistics while the Government’s economic advisers wait for more and more economic indicators of a down trend in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it a fact that both the present Prime Minister and his predecesor have stated on several occasions that <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures being practised by the Government would not result in the sacking of Commonwealth public servants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That reminds me to repeat what I said in my speech earlier, that if we adopt the Labor Party’s attitude of benefits for everybody it would mean the destruction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that there is some truth in what  Senator Murphy  says, but I think it is a heavily exaggerated item in the growth of the American industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will discover that in the net position the American contribution to overseas defence and wars was substantial enough to outweigh any gain that country might have received by being a powerful industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span> in times of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Treasurer, noted the statement by  Sir Henry  Bolte, Premier of Victoria, in an Australian Broadcasting Commission telecast last night that the measure which would do more to stimulate our flagging <span class="highlight">economy</span> than any other measure would be a reduction in interest rates to about 5 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the relief of unnecessary distress by an immediate increase in unemployment benefits and other social services.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Government continue lo tell the people of Australia that there is nothing wrong with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when all available indicators show that we are now moving into a serious recession? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Turnbull that he understands that it is quite possible that the Australian Government will contribute to the expenses of members concerned - in spite of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, what is being done to upgrade the Gladstone Airport to match the rapidly developing <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that city or town? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister and his predecessor both state, on several occasions, that Government <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures would not result in the retrenchment of Commonwealth Public Servants, and that such action would, in fact, aggravate the unemployment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the subject of inflation comes within the responsibility of the Minister for Labour and National Service whom 1 represent in this chamber, perhaps I shall be permitted to say that everybody in the Parliament would probably recognise inflation as the major serious challenge to the soundness of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is while that challenge is before us that the Government is alert to the necessity to restrain increases in wages by taking action to intervene in important cases and to put to the tribunal argument that bears upon the consequences of any decision upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision to intervene will be made case by case according to the Minister’s judgment of the possible importance of the decision to the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In anticipation of the matter being raised here today I have prepared - with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of words I hope - a response on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice:  ls  a  team of experts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development scheduled to carry out  a  survey of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>; if so, will ihe result be known before November 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the study is to provide the basis for an assessment of the role of overseas investment in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and for a full and objective examination of both benefits and costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the latest estimates by the Reserve Bank of the growth of the gross national product of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at current prices and at constant prices for the current financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to keep trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> under review and to formulate policies, the Government receives assessments of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its possible future course from a number of sources, among them the Reserve Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did not you say that you believed in the freedom of mergers and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of size? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the danger to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the wage-induced inflation associated with industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is most significant because certainly not only the rural areas and primary producers may suffer but also the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will suffer if hot money starts to flow into Australia, lt would be against our national interest for a decision of this sort to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reductions in bank interest rates, together with the significant reductions in yields on government securities and in private interest rates have placed general downward pressure on the cost of finance in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has intervened in all major cases before the Arbitration Commission; the Arbitration Act has been amended to stress public-interest considerations; and the Government is aiming to increase the element of competition in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by strengthening the legislation against restrictive trade’ practices and speeding up the review of the tariff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Economy</span> of time and respect for the question require that I ask to see a question of that sort in writing and have a brief opportunity to refer it to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows: ( 1 ), (2) and (3) The bounty, introduced in 1942, was devised in the light of conditions in the industry and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally at the time, in the context of the need for effective prosecution of the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one of the important arms of our Defence Services has been so restricted in the so-called cause of Government <span class="highlight">economy</span>, why is it that the Federal Treasurer has been allowed an RAAF VIP aircraft to fly to Nairobi, a trip which will take some 1 6 hours flying time each way and will cost about $20,000, when he could have gone by commercial aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the legislation is sectionally directed against one important section of the community for discriminatory impact, contributing to centralisation as the Government depresses the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the outlying areas and foments extravagant expenditure to create cities artificially, I content myself with saying that I was particularly impressed with  Senator Webster’s  speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Government expect the rest of the community to resist copying this example which, in the face of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, can only be described as gross mismanagement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister noted that last night the Professor of Economics at La Trobe University, Professor Whitehead, in a significant address, stated that the dominant factors in the  present worrying situation affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, namely encouragement of the wages explosion and the heavy increase in government spending, have combined to accelerate inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Treasurer made it quite clear in his statement on Tuesday night that the measures which were enunciated in his address to the House of Reps were part of the Government’s plans to overcome the inflation in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has stated, and the Opposition agrees, that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a dangerous position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Mr Chairman,  I remind you, as I had occasion to remind the Senate last night, that in the speech on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we heard last week from the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  whom the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  represents in this chamber, we were told that the Government was specifically enforcing financial controls and restrictions to limit the number of housing units that would be financed through the banking system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is suggested by the Opposition that the amendment represents a wise precaution which will help to encourage the flow of funds for housing and would be wisely inserted in the legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to overcome excessive fluctuations in the Australian monetary scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we include a specific objective with regard to one particular sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, then we might well do the same with regard to some other particular sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By keeping its wording in the broader terms and in the form in which we find it now, we overcome that problem and also give the same treatment to all forms of financing in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent increases in interest rates on housing loans were a necessary concomitant of the increases in interest rates which had occurred in other areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If interest rates paid to depositors in building societies and savings bank investment accounts had not moved in line with interest rate movements elsewhere in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the flow of funds into these institutions- and therefore the flow of housing finance- would have been markedly reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Government’s final realisation that it is the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which provides the wealth of a community and allows a government to carry out its social program, will the Government provide a further impetus to the private sector by not proceeding with its capital gains tax and its misguided tax on what the Government is pleased to call ‘unearned income’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Minister has said to us is that there are a group of indicators, which he nominates, that demonstrate to him, but not to me, that this country, its employment, its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are all on a steady rate of improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am sure that we are not in a period of stagflation and the way the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will start to go in the first half of next year will be an indication of a return to the problem demand position that we had some 12 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Government’s stated aim of a 4 per cent real expansion in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this financial year, and in the light of the devaluation of the Australian dollar by 1 7.5 per cent and subsequent revaluation by 2 per cent, is the Government still depending on an increase in the velocity of money to realise that aim, as was suggested by the Treasurer in an interview with the Brisbane economist,  Mr H.  W. Herbert, published in the Brisbane  Sunday Mail  dated 28 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the matters raised by the honourable senators,  Senator Wriedt  asked what will be done to reduce the revenue cost of the new deduction for trading stock if conditions in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that, with an improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we can expect to see the annual rate of inflation falling and as the rate falls the trading stock deductions will cost the revenue less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policies which the Government has been trying to pursue have been to encourage confidence in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The authoritative United Nations publication  World Energy Supplies  1950-1974, published in 1976, provides statistics for world commercial energy consumption from 1950 to 1974.I know of no authoritative source providing comparable data for the decades between 1925 and 1955 but  Energy in the World <span class="highlight">Economy</span>  (J.

    <p>I remind the Minister of recent statements by the Prime Minister to the effect that it is the responsibility of the business community to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again and I refer the Minister to reports that the Special Youth Employment Training Scheme is becoming increasingly susceptible to abuse by companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Government has been active in closing tax avoidance loopholes, as he said, but it is also probably true that no government on record in recent years has had more reason to increase its revenue than the present Government because of the difficulties in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The so-called ‘underground <span class="highlight">economy</span>’- the people who evade taxes, engage in barter and avoid being included in government statistics- now accounts for between 25 and 30 percent of the national income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">economy</span> air fare from Adelaide to Melbourne is $21.90 and that from Melbourne to Sydney is $23.50, making a total of $45.40, and the fare for the direct flight from Adelaide to Sydney is also $45.40, why do not the people of South Australia get the benefit of the reduced costs of the direct flight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first class fare on the direct route from Adelaide to Sydney is $2.90 cheaper than that payable to travel via Melbourne, but 1 suggest that both the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and first class fares for the direct flight from Adelaide to Sydney should be substantially cheaper than they are at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are conscious of the fact that some foreign capital is required to stimulate our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and provide industries, but there should be strict control by the Government on the extent of the capital, with permits granted only after approval by a foreign investment committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since federation the country has generated and strengthened its <span class="highlight">economy</span> and has demonstrated, through the ability of the people who represent this country, that we must make our views known for the good of other areas of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be conceded that at present the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is particularly sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, whilst we can rightly claim that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally is in a sound condition, in some areas of primary production the situation is different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we should be careful not to rely purely upon the minerals industry as the basic stay of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no period since the depression - and that is beyond my memory - when reliance on exports for the sustenance of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has resulted in primary industries taking such a heavy blow because of their inability to sell their products at a price sufficient to return them a profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There may be some advantage in this situation for a short time, but we trust that the Government will not allow the arrangements for this trade or the arrangements for the Japanese or United Kingdom trade to inhibit the Australian National Line from operating in its own behalf as a separate entity, thus assisting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and providing great benefits to the Australian producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite should ask themselves how the American <span class="highlight">economy</span> would run today if it were not for wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, outside the court the then Treasurer,  Mr Fadden,  who later became  Sir Arthur  Fadden, registered concern about what he referred to as the spiralling inflationary costs which were affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and he placed all the blame for this on the quarterly adjustments to the basic wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the GovernorGeneral said in his Speech, the Government will follow policies aimed at broadening the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and further developing the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that the national Parliament should control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States, sovereign though they may be, are sensible enough to realise that there cannot be different economies for each State with different levels of taxation or different taxation systems if we are to maintain a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government controls the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has accepted this responsibility but the only solution it can find for the recurring periods when the Government says that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is hot - that is the word used by the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  - is to lift interest rates to deter spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when those rates are raised from 6% to 64% and then again from  6i%  to 7i%, with inflation still recurring, is it not time to think that perhaps the cure is not doing what it was suggested it would do and that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not assisted by persistent and consistent increases in interest rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that men with industrial and commercial experience should be included in the Arbitration Commission because they would examine the effect of their decisions on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country as a whole and would not have regard only to the simple act of adjusting wages in according with the cost of living, particularly having regard to the fact that one important section of the community is left right out of calculations and cannot share in the cutting up of the cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the matter of interest rates, we find that the Government is failing to grapple with problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that one of the classical things to do when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is becoming over-heated is to push up interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It believes in quick profits and free enterprise, but because of the way the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is organised today it must face up to having some government enterprises operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a most important observation because our natural resources are playing their part in the tremendous increase in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A copy of the Mission’s report, which dealt with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Laos, has been lodged with the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to bring to the Senate a few figures which show just how important the wheat industry is to Australia and the contribution that it has made to Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and to set against that the cost in terms of payments by the Commonwealth to wheat growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that 40 years ago we sowed 18 million acres of wheat with horse power and it took us nearly 40 years before we caught up again to that acreage, the argument that the Australian wheat industry has increased disproportionately either to the population or the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> is complete and utter utter nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a viable rural industry in Australia is still of great significance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but the Government has mishandled this industry by its policies of expediency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Placing a restriction on production is not the answer to the problem, although it is generally the answer which the conservatives offer every time something crops up which interferes with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of an industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point that I want to make is to reiterate that the primary industry sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> enjoys a special differential in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For reasons of <span class="highlight">economy</span> therefore, each airline is allotted the traffic from specified States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in Australia at that time was one of mounting production and an ability to dispose of our crop to the benefit of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> within Australia and also to the benefit of our credits in overseas funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator also failed to inform the Senate of the economic conditions which applied in 1930-31 as a result of the mishandling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia in the previous 13 years by the Conservatives, of the same political colour as his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years we have seen quite a dramatic change from a society which was substantially based on a rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> to a society based on a highly industrialised <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with all the consequences that flow from that type of organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate at which it is growing is much greater than the growth rate of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole, so it does make an enlarged demand on resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the general reason that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> must be quietened down, that it is getting hot and inflationary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell us if it is a matter of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation being likely to suffer or the present inflationary trend being likely to rise sharply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could be critical of the Government and say that it controls the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as I agree that it should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to bear the burden of the foolish financial policies which this Government has followed It is said that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is becoming overheated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also has been a very good part of Government policy because if there is one industry that does an amazing amount of good for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and gets men employed it is the building industry, the housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who want to purchase an existing home are the ones who are being told that money to purchase it cannot be made available to them until July because there is no benefit to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at all if a person buys a completed home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I realise, and anyone who has any common sense and knows business in this country or any other today, realises that if people selling homes that were wanted and being waited for by ex-servicemen eligible for war service home loans knew that $2m or more was to be pumped into the home buying <span class="highlight">economy</span> between now and the end of July, up would go the price of homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I wish to raise this matter because I believe that the Senate, in considering some very important problems relating to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, should be aware of what has been happening in Western Australia, particularly as regards the attitude which has been adopted by firms of stockbrokers in the city of Perth to small investors and the lack of action by the Stock Exchange of Perth to protect those small investors who wish to participate, whether wisely or unwisely, in what they regard as being a profitable market in stocks and shares in those companies which are, or have been until very recently, making considerable profits out of the extraction of Australian mineral wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is a great dealto add in relation to this matter, but I believe that the attention of the Senate should be drawn to the fact that, although we are supposed to be operating in a free market <span class="highlight">economy</span> where it is said that the strength of the present euphemistically described private enterprise system is that everybody can participate in this great wealth and that the day of the single capitalist or the small oligarchy controlling a group of combines is gone, that everybody can now share in the risks, adventure, profits, losses, panic, greed  - it  is open to all - as we have now discovered from R. M. Black and Associates and the Stock Exchange of Perth, the only people who  can  share in the greed, panic and fear  are  their own established clients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time my Department has devoted considerable effect to examining ways of achieving greater effectiveness, stability and <span class="highlight">economy</span> of operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be said that the problem is threefold: Firstly, there is the need to maintain basic defence aircraft facilities capable of supporting the Services; secondly, there is the need to ensure that the technologies of the industry are upgraded in line with the latest developments; and thirdly, there is the need to achieve <span class="highlight">economy</span> of operation, which in itself not only involves developing projects for the industry but also rationalising effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, my Department has devoted considerable effort to examining ways of achieving greater effectiveness, stability and <span class="highlight">economy</span> of operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the importance of the banana industry to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the North Coast area of New South Wales, will the Minister direct the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to conduct another economic survey of the industry in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In small countries such as the Philippines there are grave problems in the sugar industry which is the backbone of the country’s rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the question of the primary producer will be approached by all parties on the basis that all that we want to do - all of us - is what is best to assist and improve a deserving section of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is growing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s performance in managing its <span class="highlight">economy</span> compares very favourably with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s overall policy has been aimed at achieving stability; at assisting the farmer to achieve income growth along with the rest of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; and at helping farmers adjust to the changing circumstances of the rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, governments have very great responsibilities to help the people who make up such a vital part of the nation and its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To continue with my remarks on the suggested royal commission, much would be involved in ihe scope of the inquiry which would have to cover many ramifications of the whole Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, lt would have to deal with tariff protection and Government policy, it would have to cover freight costs, wages, handling costs to get the produce to the consumer here or overseas: and it would have to cover some important side issues, such as the incidence of death duties as they affect farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the workers should not receive additional wages, lt has always appeared to me to be most pertinent that the Supreme Court judge turned to the employers advocate and said: ‘We agree that inflation is not good for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but who is going to lead the way back?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that Australia is a live and vital country with a tremendous <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and it is completely unreal to suggest that because some people want to exercise their right to protest - within the law if you like - that right should take precedence of the management and conduct of the affairs of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost squeeze is having a bad effect on the whole of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that soaring results are being achieved from the discovery of new mineral fields and that the export overseas of our basic ores is bridging temporarily a gap that would have been most serious to the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, nevertheless, we will overlook at our peril the importance which the wool industry generally has for Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been allowed to become inflated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were told about some of the blue prints which, amongst other things, were drawn up for the creation of a virile <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a sort of virile way of life in many of these Asian countries in which there has been an ideological struggle as to who was going to maintain the balance of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of linking the recently announced increase in interest rates with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as I said here some considerable time ago the use of interest rates is a traditional and well recognised economic procedure in relation to any adjustments that may be necessary in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister representing the Treasurer inform the Senate: How does it help the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to force the family man to pay an increased rate of interest - a savage rate - on the mortgage of his home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has invited me to make a statement regarding the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at question time, but I am a bit reluctant to set about to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I indicated earlier, there will be opportunities to discuss the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly when we are dealing with the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because we on our side of politics, who have the responsibility to govern, wish to preserve those things mat I have mentioned, that from time to time we have to look at the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and make adjustments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One group should not be selected as a basis for saying that throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there is a variation in interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said in response to  Senator Murphy’s  question, the interest: rate is an instrument of management in dealing with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anything goes wrong with those sea routes - we know it has gone wrong and we have seen the evidence of what happens when it has gone wrong - to deter the proper development of Tasmania then we of course suffer, our <span class="highlight">economy</span> suffers, and we will continue to bc a mendicant State for years into the future unless the natural resources and the natural attractions of this State of ours can be used and exploited to the maximum possible extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot see how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania would ever be able to sustain the inevitable added costs of sending Tasmanian produce through our ports, having it unloaded again at one of the main container ports on the mainland and then being consigned overseas, unless massive support - I use the word ‘massive’ advisedly - was given by the Commonwealth, either as a subsidy to the Australian National Line which probably will have the main responsibility of providing a feeder service, or to Tasmanian exporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it has not kept pace with the result of the lack of the Government’s capabilities to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government tells us that it should manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that that is why it has certain controls over banking institutions, why it has the right to tax federally and why it has the right to restrict the activities of the States in their spendings of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government says that it is necessary that it manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Government is responsible for every increase that takes place in the interest rates that have to be paid for the use of money obtained on credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every time the Government has increased the interest rates - from when they were  4i%  to now when they are 8%  -  it has given the same reason and every time it has failed to balance the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or to dampen the inflation in a long range plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst wishing to maintain the highest possible rate of growth in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Government feels that it must ease the inflationary pressures currently at work even if this means that some new construction must be deferred for a little while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely nobody thinks that industry or commerce could absorb in all of the ramifications of modern productivity a turnover tax 10 times larger and still retain a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> and an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is not subject to gross inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee further commented, in paragraph 150, that, when the Constitution was drafted, no government in Australia was responsible  lor the  general state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including the level of employment, stability of the value of the currency and the rale of balance of economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, this in itself is a built in contradiction because we cannot control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and automatically allow the expenditure of money in terms of Commonwealth revenue, lt may be proper in modern economic circumstances, however much we may be disgruntled about it as taxpayers and even as senators, to increase the rate of taxation to curb inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is one of the factors, I believe, that have produced a tremendous degree of centralisation within our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it is in a particularly limited and somewhat technical field, its very presentation highlights again the difficulties that are continuously occurring and reoccurring in the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to highlight the fact, as may well be mentioned at  a  later hour’ today in another context, that the whole of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> must be looked at and that whether- it is to be supported by this prop in this area, by a subsidy in some other area or by another prop in one industry and a longer and stronger prop in another part of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, surely, should be part of the one concept and should be considered as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, faced with the position that we accept the principle incorporated in the Bill - that we should try to preserve rural assets in the hands of those who created them and not require them to be sold on a falling market for the payment of duty which is in respect of assets built up in times of greater prosperity but which becomes payable in times of depreciated prosperity and is required to be paid when money is no longer available except by the sale of assets - and that we accept that that principle should be applied at least at this time in the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, then it is a matter of examining whether these principles as carried into operation in this Bill are adequate and whether they really perform the task that the legislation purports to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We live in a community in which there is a gradual flight from the land and in which the old and very satisfactory type of rural settlement - that is, the small family farm with the diversified rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> - is disappearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the plea that it is very difficult to keep selective one sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for special treatment in relation to taxation measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must have some effect upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a particular crisis is dampened down in whole or in part with only a limited degree of effectiveness, we find a crisis then develops in some other area of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we find that attempts are made over the whole spectrum of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> to try to give some relief in one way or another, whether by the provision of differential interest rates or by some other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things are symptomatic of the continuing crisis which ripples through the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, developing at crisis points from one moment to another, and to which temporary and sporadic remedies are applied, lt is in view of this situation and because of the prospect that there may be no immediate method of doing anything to remedy it that  Senator McManus  has put this motion before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are of the opinion that the temporary palliatives have obviously had their day, that no success has been achieved, and that the problem is so extensive and so deep that it is impossible to consider any part of it in isolation and that it must be considered in expanse and in depth over the whole of the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that any attempt to isolate one primary industry, to consider it in isolation, and to attempt to diagnose its troubles and to prescribe a remedy - to do all that successfully in the whole spectrum of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> - is fated to failure, lt just cannot be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we of the DLP say that we must have a complete analysis of the rural sector in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must remember that the whole pattern and significance of the rural sector in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has changed vastly in the last 20 or 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rural industry has lost in Australian thinking a certain degree of significance, and because that is so it is quite possible that its real difficulties may not be properly appreciated as it ceases to be of such critical and fundamental importance to the stability of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thinking of the Democratic Labor Party is that whether our propositions are correct does not depend merely on assessing the condition of one industry, but on really assessing the condition of that industry in relation to the whole rural sector, the tariff and taxation policies of Australia, and all those other things which influence the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any part of Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally I refer to this investigation of the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a problem that  Dr Mansholt  says has to be handled by a total investigation at the very base level of what is now, in the modern cliche, called the infrastructure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The workers believe that the absence of price control is responsible for the present inflation that is affecting our whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> and making it impossible for the ordinary working family to live on present wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the situation in which we find ourselves at present in relation to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> I hope that these 2 matters in particular will be given very serious consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provided the adjustment proposed is in conformity with the general movement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and takes account of other developments affecting the income of doctors, the National Health Insurance Commission should negotiate a revised medical insurance table wilh the medical benefits funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its <span class="highlight">economy</span> is placed in such a position that the Government cannot say from day to day what its financial position will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We still need overseas investment in order to maintain our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am trying to point out by example  that  there is a wide division in the Government parties over this Bill when there ought to be unanimity because of its implication for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, for the encouragement of Australian capital participation and for the encouragement of the establishment of business in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, being in financial difficulties, endeavoured to dampen down the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by imposing substantial increases in the rates of sales tax on a number of commodities, particularly in the so-called luxury field - motor cars, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the area in which a dampening of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now taking place by the imposition of higher interest rates and by the failure of the Government to provide sufficient funds for the construction of homes in each of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, either the Government or its advisers are to blame for the mishandling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why I am introducing this aspect is to prove that, at least if something like what is proposed in the Bill is done, it does something to sustain the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by keeping small people in business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These three methods are all democratic methods and can be quite effective providing they are properly planned, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There might be some justification for doing this if something substantial were coming into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but it is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worthwhile to observe, in passing, that the writers, actors and film makers who are referred to specifically in this report are not the only people concerned for from these groups of people flow a large number of industries, a large number of groups and a large number of personalities who, in a variety of ways, are involved in and contribute to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to our community life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Providing we can produce from these deposits at an economic price and have the facilities for export, such activities will prove invaluable to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can merely repeat what I have said in the past, that the decision to increase interest rates was taken having regard to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a well accepted and traditional procedure in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it a fact that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia is dependent mainly on the motor car industry and the household consumer goods industry which includes washing machines, sewing machines, refrigerators and so on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History is studded with examples of variations in the movement of interest rates from time totime, linked to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of regard for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and that means regard for people and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that what it thinks is social justice, or ought it not direct its action into areas where it really thinks the <span class="highlight">economy</span> ought to be dampened? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia and what it means to people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those increases and drops have been in accordance with what the United Kingdom Government considered to be appropriate action to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government take particular notice of the fact that some States are suffering undue pressure as a result of these restrictions which are hitting the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  do not think that  in  these circumstances go vernment action to control petrol exports would lessen the price of petrol  i’n  Australia or assist the overall <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people generally, I believe, are willing to view many primary industries, in the very exciting context of the development of mineral resources and the sales of other commodities which definitely are supporting Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time, as being perhaps not as important as they were previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need that because of the fluctuations of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>American nationals who had investments overseas were requested to repatriate as much of their funds as was possible in order to give io that giant of private enterprise more security and strength within ils own <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we require this second line of defence to give security to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to our standard of living and to our women and children so that the good life that we enjoy may continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These questions appear to me to present certain problems, but undoubtedly they were introduced by the Department in an attempt to achieve <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should never forget that the great prosperity enjoyed by the bulk of Australians has been due in a large measure to the contributions made to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole by the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one could possibly assert that the development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> achieved to date would have been attained without wool providing much of the wherewithal for the imports of essential materials and equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as its continuing prominent role in Australia’s export trade, wool growing is an essential component of the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government fully recognises the significance of the woolgrowing industry not only as an export income earner but also as a vital factor in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recognised that, if there were a substantial revenue loss and no replacement tax were introduced, the inflationary effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be severe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding to outline the contents of the legislation, I feel I must strongly emphasise the importance, particularly in view of existing demand pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, of ensuring that there is not at this stage any substantial loss in budgeted revenue collections such as would occur if the Commonwealth did not legislate on the basis requested by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that past experience has shown the South Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is heavily dependent on the motor vehicle, house appliance and building industries, to be particularly adversely affected by this sort of trend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Le/ mc make the additional comment that aviation in Australia, in the domestic and international fields, is growing at the rate of about  5%  per annum, which is a much faster growth rate than in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not my intention to intrude unduly upon the time of the Senate, but 1 feel that it would be less than generous if a number of Queensland senators did not contribute to this debate, firstly to express appreciation of involvement by the Commonwealth in this particular major work for the benefit of the Bundaberg district, Queensland and Australia through the sugar industry; and, secondly, briefly to refer to the tremendous importance and great significance of that industry to Queensland and to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these things are important, and I feel that the participation by the Commonwealth in this scheme, which not only gives a new vitality and new encouragement to the people of the area but also indicates the Commonwealth’s involvement in the conservation of a great national resource, will strengthen this part of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in doing so will strengthen the whole rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I read an article that referred to a statement by Colin Clark, the well known economist, to the effect that, although Germany had undertaken with considerable success measures for a free <span class="highlight">economy</span> after the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>measures for a free <span class="highlight">economy</span> had not been developed in the field of primary production in that country; instead there was a system of subsidies for primary production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that, when he asked a leading member of the German Government why these measures for a free <span class="highlight">economy</span> had been applied to everything except farming, the answer was that there were too many votes involved in the agricultural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt will go some way towards solving a social problem in the  rural  sector, lt will strengthen the economies in those regions where low income farms are concentrated and in turn  the  national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an article in today’s ‘Australian’ regarding a statement by the Secretary of Defence in the United States of America,  Mr Laird,  to the effect that he was not committed to buying another 40 Fill aircraft and a statement by  Senator Charles  Percy of the United States in which he described the FI 1 1 project as a disaster aud said that the money involved should not be added as another strain on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may open up the ground for some criticism as to whether there has been adequate fiscal control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as against reliance on monetary control to try to stem inflation and stabilise the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should give serious consideration to this point because the level of workers’ compensation is a measuring stick by which we may gauge the progress ot our community and our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disruption of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which ensued has to a large extent been alleviated by the introduction of reasonable workers’ compensation provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of the Government relating to tariffs has presented a great challenge to the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Board had done a magnificent job over the years, it has not available to it the physical capacity to examine all the factors associated with the effect of tariffs and duties on imports in the balancing up of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This industry is a most important segment in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition opposes the Thirteenth Schedule because a technically developed industry which has grown up under the protection of tariffs and which has taken its place in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should not be disturbed to the extent that it will be as a result of this Thirteenth Schedule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed unfortunate that the implications of a matter of such consequence should come before the Senate in the dying hours of this session and in association with this measure because undoubtedly this Bill is being used, and quite properly used, as a vehicle for the discussion of matters of very great import to the whole structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the modern Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and perhaps in most modern economies, ‘here are substantial disciplines of one character or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major disciplines which are exercised in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> have stemmed from about five principal sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this modern Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Tariff Board must be prepared to assume its proper place and accept its proper responsibility as one of the great contributing economic disciplines in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in more latter years and in more recent reports by the Tariff Board it has become evident that the Tariff Board is now seeing itself in its true perspective as one of the contributing disciplines in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a development we should all welcome because, after all, it is quite proper that if this role is to be played by the Tariff Board in a proper manner it must publicly acknowledge the principles on which it feels disposed to operate and the part which it thinks it can most valuably play in the development and organisation of the Austraiian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would welcome an intimation from the Minister for Civil Aviation who in this chamber represents the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  that at an appropriate time in the Senate - and sometimes the Senate does have opportunity before legislation comes through from another place - a motion might be put down in which honourable senators of all political shades and from various walks of life might intimate their concept of the function and role of the Tariff Board in the modern Australia and whether, in the restructuring of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, consideration should be given to this and, if so, what part it should play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the process of doing so it also holds up living standards because this is an interdependent <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed it will always be so in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is advancing as this <span class="highlight">economy</span> is advancing.But I think one could confine oneself to the observation that we are living in an interdependent developing <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not really think that any one sector of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> can afford to do without the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To sum up the case that I have made against this tax let me remind honourable senators that we are now being asked, under the subterfuge of the urgent need for the money by the States - something of which we have all1 been aware for the last 5 years - to pass into Federal legislation an anomalous form of taxation that is evil in its potential because, if carried to the limits suggested by the Federal Treasurer and increased tenfold, it would wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this country is very prosperous at the present time, stresses are appearing in certain sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and they are causing a process of inflation which nobody wants to see occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that other taxes can be imposed which are not nearly so injurious to the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> as is this receipts tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government is continually telling people that because of stresses on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> expenditure must be reduced, but what does it do to set an example? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system of permanency was not only a necessity to cut out the defects of the old casual hire system but it was a necessity in the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in that there needed to be some new system which would face up to the changes which have now largely taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to realise is that while the waterside workers certainly gol a scheme of permanency which was better than the old system of casual hire, and while they knew what they were doing day after day, the fact is that in any <span class="highlight">economy</span> any section of the work force has to have some consideration when in outside industry wage scales and wage standards are being improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a large part of the current problem in the industry has been due to this basic movement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party is very concerned that such an important piece of legislation as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should be dealt with in the dying hours of a session of the Parliament, lt is of very great importance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the unions, and it is of great concern to the employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to solve labour problems in a developing <span class="highlight">economy</span> is for the parties concerned to gel together and work out a pact or a system of reform which will apply to the relevant conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have to improve their wage rates to cope with changes in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were restored to an even keel and kept that way, instead of lurching between extremes, many of the changing stresses in industrial relations would be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems very apparent to us that the economic policies of the Government to a large extent determine the kind of labour relations we will have in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is unbalanced, if the thrust is upon workers in relation to COWS then there will be much more activity from the unions to establish a system which will give them belter conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at most of the disruptions in the industrial scene one will find that most of them are related to such matters and rarely are they related to extraneous matters which do not concern the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Basically most disputes arise from problems in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The arbitration system has not been able to match the problems which arise out of the developing <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the growth of productivity and the general improvement of welfare in the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem lo me that the most satisfactory way to deal with the people who are out to upset the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or to create disputes in the work force is lo provide an arbitration system which will allow unions and workers to get the maximum from the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions are pushing for improved conditions in a situation where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is able to grant them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have this strange situation in a so-called free <span class="highlight">economy</span> where prices are not fixed by any authority yet wages are fixed by the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if the Government expects the trade union movement to accept its proposals, likewise the trade union movement expects the Government to apply some system of rationalisation to costs and prices which at least will create an integrated <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Branson  put a question on the notice paper a couple of years ago in which he gave a colossal figure as the measure of the effect that the Mount Isa strike had on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> pf Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By these proposals the Government seeks: - to provide for a large increase in essential expenditures, especially on payments to the States, welfare, development and assistance to industry, including emergency relief for woolgrowers hard hit by drought and low prices; - to make reductions in personal income taxation, especially on lower and middle income earners, estimated to have a value to the taxpayers concerned of $289m in a full financial year and $228m in 1970-71; we thereby make good - indeed more than make good - our undertaking to give substantial income tax relief to this large body of people; - notwithstanding these large commitments, to produce a responsible budget, a balanced budget, a budget shaped to the requirements of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is dynamic and fast-growing - but an <span class="highlight">economy</span> still threatened by disruptive inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700818_senate_27_s45/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The current year thus began with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> pretty much at full stretch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700818_senate_27_s45/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the serious dislocation facing the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of the increase of 12^% in freight rates by all shipping lines trading to and from Tasmania, the inevitable impact on the cost of exporting primary products from Tasmania to the mainland and the increase in the cost of living to consumers in that Slate, will the Minister consult with the Treasurer with a view to giving urgent consideration to the granting of a special freight subsidy to Tasmania until some meaningful solution can be found to allay the deep concern of all Tasmanians over this steep freight increase? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put this to the Government: What sort of an administration do we have when all of a sudden we are confronted with inescapable problems relating to the primary industries which are our traditional backbone, the basic part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators mean to say that people with a developing <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as we see in that vast area of Asia are not seeking to improve their quality of life and their standard of living? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Government and its advisers to lift this industry which has been such a vital segment of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> back to where the people in it can feel with confidence that they are recognised in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Improvements to wool marketing, research into the problems of the industry, debt reconstruction and farm adjustment necessarily take time, but short term urgent measures are clearly needed to prevent a loss of confidence in the industry which would be reflected throughout the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask this question: Is this all the interest the Australian Labor Party has in this major sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must bear in mind the present conditions of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly honourable senators opposite who are trying to interject agree with me that in Australia today we have a very sound <span class="highlight">economy</span> which enables the average wage earner, the average businessman and the average industrialist to live in very satisfactory circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When referring to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in 1 970, it said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The performance of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the inaugural year of the decade will not belie those hopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fluctuations in farm output are conspicuous but, inasmuch as they relate to a much larger proportion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the figures for nonfarm output are more significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dairying industry is in an equally precarious state, and in my own State of Queensland the sugar industry lives on borrowed time, and the whole of the North Queensland <span class="highlight">economy</span> is built on the sugar industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This exercise reveals that remarkable advances have been made in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increases in the past year indicate the rapid growth of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> within a very short period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After a decade - that brings us to the 1959-60 Budget - with an increase of about 2 million in the population, which took it to more than 10 million, the amount that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could provide for budgetary purposes was $2,783m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Australia at the present lime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This assistance is S77m in excess of that which the nation provided last year, ft will assist the vitally important rural sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in these troublous times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The wine industry is vital to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia, which I have the honour to represent, and any adverse effects suffered by the industry will be felt throughout the State, lt has been said that people have a right to make a profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of honourable senators to the publication The Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span> 1970’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Profit margins, interest rales, taxes and charges all have  a  direct part in determining cost levels within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, proportionately, can do as much lo raise costs as wage movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be only too pleased to take part in a campaign of this nature, but I am satisfied that such a campaign is another phoney trick pulled by the Government to distract attention from its mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is correct to say - here I agree with  Senator Rae  - that probably no issue in Tasmania in recent years has caused as much controversy, as much concern and as much alarm among Tasmanians generally as has this decision, and that no decision will have more effect on the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> than will this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot operate within a framework of self-sufficiency if a modern growth pattern is an objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this time, although the shipping service is absolutely vital to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania, sufficient money has not been found to hold freight rates at a reasonable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone will contradict my allegation that the Government’s policy of allowing inflation to occur in all areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has disturbed the normal economic pattern to such an extent that nobody knows where Australia is heading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased freight rates have a tendency to destroy the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the whole of Tasmania to a greater degree than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any of the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any expansion of the export potential of the Australian automotive industry would be a wonderful help to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will a statement be made to allay, in some measure, an existing disquiet in the community concerning the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures have checked and are continuing to check expenditures and, in doing so, have relieved inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the state of industrial lawlessness - that is the only way one can describe it - which has been bedevilling the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> for the past few months due to a decision by the Communist Party in Australia to launch a campaign against industrial law and order? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the present industrial lawlessness is to continue and costs continually increase not only will primary producers be put out of action altogether but also, to put it mildly, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will be placed in a very parlous position indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the primary producers go down the drain but the rest of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will go down the drain with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has to bear in mind that some people in key positions have a vested interest in the destruction of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 priority because if this situation keeps going on and on one thing is perfectly certain and that is that it will catch up with the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is well recognised that small and isolated communities in any <span class="highlight">economy</span> suffer certain disabilities which are not shared by their larger counterparts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot operate within a framework of self-sufficiency if a modern growth pattern is an objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 main sources of investment available to any <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference may not sound very much to people in the mainland States, to whom a million dollars or so a year does not make much difference, but to a small State like Tasmania with its small <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is a very significant difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that while the bulk of the community faces rising expectations - I still say that the bulk of the community is affluent but there is an increase in the area of poverty each year and we must concern ourselves with this increase because it can affect the stability of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> - those on social services face the prospect of a continuing fall in their standard of living relative to the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I think I should quote what was said on 19th August 1970 by the Minister for Air  (Senator Drake-Brockman)  in a debate on Australia’s rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the best way to approach this Budget is to begin by quoting the concluding remarks of the speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  because it would be refreshing if we did from time to time in the Budget debate address ourselves to the subject of the Budget and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are relevant things to do because 1949-50 was the year of change from what I call the running of a Socialist <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the running of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> and 1970-71 this is the year in which we are now, so we have a useful bracket of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1949-50 to 1970-71 we have had 20 years of market <span class="highlight">economy</span>, Liberal-type government, sound economic growth, great opportunity and great growth in living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improvement about which I am speaking - the multiplication of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> - depends upon the confidence of overseas investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the problems we will all face because to a very great extent Australia is a primary industry country and all of us depend a lot upon the pastoral <span class="highlight">economy</span> for our wellbeing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest as an exercise in responsibility that an increase in productivity in Australia is the best way to keep prices down in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> with full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I really wanted to say to the Senate, if with the  Deputy  President’s help  Senator Georges  will permit me to have a moment of silence, is that we have in this country this year a highly responsible Budget which is giving whatever concessions it is proper to give and which is operating a balanced-Budget <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I have enough faith in the average Australian and in the good people we are bringing into this country from overseas to believe quite confidently that they will in the not too distant future be awake to those who are trying to eat into the vitals of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a great advantage to the whole Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party seems to forget that the healthier the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the better will be the living standards of the Australian workers, ft has forgotten about the welfare of the people and what can be done for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when all members of this Parliament, irrespective of party affiliations, arc concerned about the effect of inflation on our national <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is only natural that a great deal of comment should be made outside the Parliament by the Press and leading economists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Government is budgeting for a surplus and is prepared to introduce measures to restrain inflation indicates that the Government proposes not to take deflationary action to the point where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be harmed, but to control inflation as is considered necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will continue to maintain tight control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that inflation does not increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cost the Government a good many millions of dollars each year, but I am quite sure that the returns to the producers and the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and in good times to the Treasury through taxation, have more than paid for the cost of the subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that at this time as a nation, when we are trying to build up our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and improve our quality of life, we can afford to have an exodus from the country to the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have mentioned some of the areas in which the Government could bring some relief to the cost structure of primary industries without doing any harm to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years the Government has had a tremendous record of providing assistance to the rural industries and to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am not trying to create a fear complex but I know enough about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to know that the country is largely dependent for export income on rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the effect that a recession in the rural industries will have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should look at these matters very seriously in order that we might uphold those things which are dear to this country and which over the years have made a vital contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the welfare of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our motor vehicle industry in Australia today, important to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> as you would agree, is 90 per cent owned and controlled by overseas capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the recognition of many of the claims made by the Australian Labor Party that Australia is getting into debt very quickly because of our inability to control ownership and overseas interests in this country, and in spite of the recognition obviously given to these matters by the Prime Minister, great burdens are being placed on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet honourable senators opposite say that we- must accept this position and that because of the loads on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our balance . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the loads on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> are the purchase of the Fill, overseas ownership of many important industries, and the repatriation of profits to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Budget has to be calculated to give help in the field of social services to the extent to which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can stand it and to the extent to which productivity will allow it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not contain any progressive ideas or any methods by which to improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was expected to throw overboard all regard for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the state and any responsible conduct just to answer the dictates and the directions of the people in control of trade unions and a political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it appears that the demand is reduced I will be the first to say that relief is needed for the wine industry, because it is a very significant part of the South Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, that was the prime condition which the Government had to take into consideration when preparing its Budget; but it was not the only condition, lt had to decide its expenditure and its taxation requirements in the light of the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which there has been maintained over the 20 years of this Government a situation of full employment, but in the last 12 months we have had a period where consumer spending has been rising at the rate of 9.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless in expressing those views which are not deeply researched but merely an expression of opinion which one hears I think the Government did acknowledge the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and recognise that it was one of the backgrounds in respect of which its Budget had to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason the Government reviews its charges each year, taking into account all pertinent factors, including the economic situation of the users of facilities and the contribution which air services make to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This run of speeches has been marked more by discussion of the Budget as a technical document and an analysis of it in the economic sense because of the role it plays in the control of the disciplined <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is the kind of . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">economy</span> that we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the normal course of history we might well have been given the opportunity to go about our affairs - building our population, developing our resources and building, .strengthening and extending our <span class="highlight">economy</span> - without interrup-tion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is moving into a new position internationally and into many fields of commitment, but we are still basing the whole stucture of our national <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the same concepts as we did 30, 40 or 50 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are still approaching our rural industries as if they had the same role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as they had 50 years ago and as if they were as strong economically as they were at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, what is now necessary is a complete examination of the structure and infrastructure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to find at what points and by which reorganisation the matter can be approached and investigated to see that the national wealth is accumulated and developed as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> has always traditionally provided a great part of our national wealth and is today threatened with a diminishing role in this respect, this problem particularly has to be handled not only in the economic and human interests of the people concerned, but because obviously resources in that field of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are not being used to best advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply direct the attention of honourable senators to the fact that the propositions which we advance are really related to the structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that if those items are handled properly the Parliament and the country will not be faced with the position with which they are faced in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will note that most of the propositions in our amendment are positive in context and penetrate to the fundamentals of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> - fundamentals such as defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again that is part of this method of attacking the whole infrastructure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, ft is not possible to consider a matter of such consequence as pensions in modern Australia merely by a periodic review of pensions by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means test, of course, is ancillary to that and again goes to the issue of the fundamental Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> because it goes to the issue of the conservation of resources, to the building up of savings and to the use of investment capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraphs (8) and (9) are practical propositions on the nature and structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which, if properly handled, will be reflected in the finances of the Budget and will enable the Budget to become a real and vital document from year to year, gradually advancing the conditions of the people, gradually enriching their lives and gradually extending their opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore anything done to overcome the problem or to do something to ameliorate it would be a great contribution to the strength of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any country being affected by its occurrence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will benefit the pensioner as much as it benefits anyone else, and with stability the real value of the pension will not be eroded through inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will be able to do more in time to come, but at this moment the main thing is to be responsible and to see that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is checked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government publication ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span> 1970’ the final paragraph states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first responsibility of any Government is to ensure that those people who helped build up the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation are not those who have to suffer most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The White Paper ‘The Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span> 1970’ states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that old-fashioned idea carried to the other extreme can be just as detrimental to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to the provision of all - those things that are desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, the present system is infinitely better than placing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a straightjacket with all the controls that would go with such action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is better that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is controlled in the way that it is today than that we should go the whole way and, as it were, place the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a straightjacket in order to correct the anomalies that arise periodically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one analysed the situation one would find that a lot of imagination would be required to believe that that would be sufficient for a pensioner to live in today’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe it is some thing the Government could do without disturbing the equilibrium of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I suggest that any government should be prepared to accept the responsibility of making a decision as to what the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can stand in the form of non-productive payments - I do not say that in any derogatory sense- in which 1 include those under the social welfare programme, as opposed  to  productive payments in which I include, but not exclusively, things such as national development and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn reply to the honourable senator’s remarks about an affluent society 1 did say that there is tremendous prosperity in Australia but the Treasurer has the responsibility of stabilising the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that inflation does not erode the value of the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet statements are made that people who grew up in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of those days and in those circumstances should have been saving for their old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To transfer people from an institution such as the poor house to a back room in which they can spend the declining years of their lives, which many of them are doing as these reports show, is an inexcusable policy for a government which, on the other hand, claims that it has developed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, that we have attained a high standard of living and that we have an affluent society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be saying to this capable, honourable tribunal: Take the running of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country into your own hands, spend what you like on social services, and then when you have told us what you are going to do we will tell the people what we can do, if anything, for the development of this country in relation to health, hospitals, education, defence and grants to the States.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think I would have spoken on this Bill, but he gave me a royal mention in saying that when this proposal was first introduced by the late  Senator Cole,  then Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, back in 1960 I made criticism of it, because many comparisons have been made with an arbitration type system insofar as an arbitration system determines some part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>would be one of the determinants in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>handicapped by a system of wage fixation that is unique in the world - irresponsible, unreliable, a system that has proved destructive of this continent’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> throughout the whole eleven years during which this Government has been in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia decisions of the Arbitration Commission had an enormous effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by the contribution of their long lives and individual participation in the economic life of the community, have contributed to the building up of the modern Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> with its wealth,  its affluence and the availability of all those things which go with the affluent society such as full employment, adequate hours of leisure, social conveniences, recreation, reduced working hours and things of that character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a factor to be taken into account by such an arbitral body in the general concept of its determination is the economic consequences of a major decision, then a major employer such as the Commonwealth Government which also has the overall control of the discipline of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, can legitimately present to that body the economic consequences of a determination as the Commonwealth would visualise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government says: ‘All we are prepared to do is, on each occasion on which the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the financial position of the country are considered, to see what we can do in respect of the pensions for ex-servicemen disabled people, their widows and their orphaned children’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Benefits for people disabled in the service of their country ought to be related not to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, not to what the Government does each year, not to its financial commitments or to its decision as to whether there will be inflation or deflation but to a formula of compensation such as that applying in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However active or however persuasive the Minister may be, he is subject to what Cabinet says about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> of funds’ operations will thus be reflected in their contribution rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It recites a series of changes in social standards and medical science, the strategic situation and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it identifies a number of areas of repatriation activity which it would like to see examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is obviously the sort of <span class="highlight">economy</span> which can be practised by any organisation such as this, and is one of the economies which has in fact been practised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reply to  Senator Davidson  1 can say now, speaking generally, that there have been a number of recent proposals, including those from several State Governments, for debt adjustment schemes and debt reconstruction schemes in one form or another to help alleviate the problems confronting the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally and the wool industry in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present this Committee is examining to what extent charges might be debited to particular parts of the industry and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason the Government reviews .ils charges each year, taking into account all pertinent factors, including the economic situation of the users of facilities and the contribution which air services make to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those matters have been contemplated against the background of the investigation of the interdepartmental committee which is studying the whole structure of air navigation charges - at what charges should be levied, to what extent they should be levied against the operators and to what extent they should be legitimately charged against national development, the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the national revenue and national self-interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of air freight would rise and that would have some effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is in fact striking at the heart of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we must also concede that certain grave financial problems are now presented to those who have the responsibility of framing financial documents in the modern Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is inflation when the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  warns the Arbitration Commission that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country cannot afford increased wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that  Mr Bury  is prepared to say that inflation has been contained, he warns the Commission that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not stand wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were expressed and recognised by the Treasurer at the time he presented his Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental justification for sales tax revenue, as I stressed earlier, is that it provides revenues for government, and it is an incidental justification that in the imposition of taxation the <span class="highlight">economy</span> may also be controlled in such a way as to prevent the development of those factors which it must be of constant concern to government to keep in check. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the promise is carried out and the consequence of carrying it out represents some damage or danger to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, government must make up the revenues which it has lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After careful consideration of these proposals, and of recent developments in employment and business activity in Kalgoorlie, the Government has decided that continued assistance is justified in order to allow the present gold mining activity in Kalgoorlie to continue to phase out gradually without disruption to the population and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that with the development of public and statutory corpora tions there will have to be a complete look  at  the role that they are’ to fill in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Que other matter which ought to be associated with discussions on these huge collections largely from industries which are advancing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country - I refer to transportation and aviation - Ls whether some part of the revenues collected ought to be devoted to purposes which the Senate, in its special committees, has said should be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also unfair to those unite of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which are doing a very good job in increasing production and in attempting to cope with a world of constantly changing and competitive conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many instances the application is opposed strongly not only by the employers’ federations but also by the Government itself on the grounds that it is not economic and will have an inflationary effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet these excise imposts can be placed upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and no regard is had to the fact that they are handed on to the consumer and that the consumer then has to have redress by applying for increased salaries to cover the extra costs imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having said that, 1 return to the fundamental issue which has been argued that a consumer tax, in the final analysis, increases costs as a multiplier over the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will recall, yesterday I pointed out that the policy of the Government in relation to the use of the interest rate was a matter of fiscal policy which had regard to the overall <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Rae  points out very properly, that is a complete vindication of the fiscal policy of the Government in relation to what it was necessary to do in order to have a stabilising effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must bring home to the Government that its policy with regard to this most important part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> has failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very important segment of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it warrants very careful consideration at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect can multiply in that way and have a very serious effect on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the tractor manufacturing companies, one in Victoria and one in Western Australia, are worthy of support because of the role they have played over the years in supplying balance for our overall <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to sound a warning to the Government that unless something more substantial is done than the temporary palliative offered by this Bill, these two very fine parts of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> could be threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Treasurer’s statement that the cost to the Commonwealth of paying pensioners an additional 50c a week would be an extra $30m a year and would plunge the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into headlong inflation, can the Minister now advise what will be the effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the loss of $90m this financial year because of the Commonwealth being unable to collect the receipts duties tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further will the Minister give an assurance that after the Senate election no credit squeeze will be brought about by the banks or by the introduction of a supplementary budget because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been affected by the loss of the $90m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major things that are facing the people of this country and the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country is something that does not ever receive any consideration at all from the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 apologise to some degree if I have wandered a little in my remarks, but I am very annoyed to see members of this House running away from an issue of such importance, not only to individuals in the community but also to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that a much more positive approach should be made in order to make certain that this important segment of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is given continuity for the purpose of planning for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 the then Treasurer said in his Budget Speech that he felt that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country was in such a buoyant condition that it would be advisable for the Government to look closely at the taxation schedules, particularly those covering the lower and middle income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1970 Budget imposes almost the same inflationary pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is borne out by the warnings to the people of Australia and, in particular, to the industrial tribunals, of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  and the Treasurer  (Mr Bury),  that -the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot stand wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when the Treasurer is questioned about greater reductions in taxation to assist those on lower incomes or about increases in benefits paid to those less fortunate within our community he says that the Budget is finely balanced and to do anything more with it would throw the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When honourable senators opposite have ruined the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country the Australian Labor Party will be asked to take over and rectify the mess they have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would assume that the Government would be able to take little or no action during the tenure of the commission  to attack the problems which are so common and, indeed, which are causing such desperation in this area of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a strange country in that we are a developed economic society, yet we have something of the nature of an undeveloped country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> because we are always searching for markets for the export of raw materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>these problems of primary industry, to a large degree, are inherent in the very nature of this land and this land’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party is concerned about the future of Australia’s rural industries because they have a great effect upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federation states that the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the non-metropolitan areas is now almost twice as high in the country as in the city and rhat the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in an extremely grave situation, far worse than can be gleaned from statistics alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 rise mainly because the previous  speaker, Senator O’Byrne,  referred to the Opposition’s amendment but spent the main part of his speech criticising the Government for bringing in such a measure and taking us over a wide area of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> ranging through the oil industry, the Fill, the Phantom, the wool subsidy and  Sir Robert  Menzies’ memoirs and finishing up on interest rates as they apply to housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action taken in relation to the bank rate clearly was intended to slow down the liquidity and to cool down the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to some extent because it was getting overheated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While workers are trying to get some industrial justice the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  addressing a dinner at which the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was present, warned the Commission that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not stand wage rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the use of applying brakes to an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which can immediately pass on any increases in interest rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt remains our view nevertheless that an important reason for the quickening that has occurred in the pace of inflation must be attributed to the maintenance in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of stronger pressures of demand for products.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Institute dealt objectively and subjectively with the factors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the factors outside Australia which are having an inflationary effect upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, we would argue that the real needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been stated already in this debate, for the September quarter of this year the price increase is down to an average of 2.4 per cent, which is an extraordinarily low figure for any government to be able to achieve in its control of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which at the same time there is an extremely low unemployment rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other figures given are West Germany, which is always known to have a booming <span class="highlight">economy</span>, 4.3 per cent; the United States, 4.9 per cent; New Zealand, 3.9 per cent; and France, 5.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place it recognises that, in an expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there may be inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect I can do no better than quote from a Treasury document entitled ‘The Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span> 1970’, and in particular the following pregnant paragraph which appears at page 12: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Profit margins, interest rates, taxes and charges all have a direct part in determining cost levels within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, proportionately, can do as much to raise costs as wage movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that price control in a peace time <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the be all and end all but I do say that some subsidy could be granted to certain basic commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I give him full credit because he was sufficient of a patriot and interested enough in the welfare of his own country to try to do the right thing by the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He looked for support to the trade union movement but it said, if I may say so: ‘To blazes with the nation and to blazes with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that honourable senators opposite have done, in my judgment, is to attempt to justify the present trend in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The income of these people is now being eroded at a rapid and alarming rate because of the neglect of the Government to exercise its proper function and jurisdiction in the control of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great consequences flow from neglect or disinclination on the part of the elected government to apply the necessary restraints and limitations upon the insidious forces which run in the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you accept that proposition, then how on earth can you claim that wages are bedevilling the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if one looks at the balance on current account one sees that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is really kept afloat by our trading with Asian countries, lt is they who give us the pluses in our balance on current account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the commodity is beef, lamb, veal, milk, cream, cereals or any other basic commodity, practically every section of our rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the most serious thing that faces the stability of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole pattern of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the value of our money, the concessions we have made in keeping up this relationship between Great Britain and Australia over the past century, and more, have been put aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we should send a special delegation to the United Kingdom to ask for time to readjust our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to allow our farmers to diversify, if possible, away from the commodities which are affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been of tremendous help to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>40-hour week over a period of years, but its initial impact was disastrous to the New South Wales <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to argue that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has not been adjusted over a period of time to meet the reduced hours, but that is vastly different to a proposal for the introduction of a 35-hour week without regard to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and without regard to the employment of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this is the indication that the 35-hour week would wreck the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> a fact of life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With great respect to the honourable senator who asked the question I fee) bound to say that he has oversimplified ihe economics of the situation when he suggests that all problems are solved by working on a percentage of the wages of the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the basis of his figures so I do not challenge them but they have no regard to the flow-on which goes right through an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply to take one set of figures and work out a percentage from them and say that, ipso facto, they do not have an effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a new form of economics with which 1 cannot compete at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing the States access to income taxation would make the Commonwealth’s task of managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> more difficult, and a scheme along the Canadian lines could result in different rates of income tax applying in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the supply of real resources is limited and, if we are to provide proper scope for the growth of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the achievement of higher standards in government services must necessarily bc a gradual progression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> would flag and the Commonwealth would be in tremendous trouble if it did not provide this money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope, as everybody else does, because the matter is of paramount importance to the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that home building in the States will continue at as high a rate as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister request the Treasurer to have a detailed report on the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> prepared and submitted to Cabinet for consideration of additional special grants to that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the time when 1 was a boy at school I have believed that the wool industry is one of the mainstays of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of rural industries in a country such as ours is not only a problem for the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also a social catastrophe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If unchecked this slide in prices could do tremendous damage to the entire Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would create an even greater imbalance in the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been made to realise because of the critical situation which confronts the rural sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today that if they do not get together quickly they will be in severe straits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A responsible citizen who has lived all his life in the central west of New South Wales and who has been associated with that area’s primary producers said recently at a meeting at Forbes in the central west of New South Wales that he has never known confidence in the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the businesses which service the rural sector to bc so low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Farmers and rural workers are bewildered by the depressed state of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, apparently within a national <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is supposed to be booming.Today it is unbelievable that the price of greasy wool is lower than it was 25 years ago Today costs and prices have risen lo record levels in a period of inflation which has been brought about by the policies pursued by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that, with the world’s population increasing and with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the developing and emerging nations being on the up and up, the demand for wool throughout the world and consequently the price paid to Australian growers would have been on the up and up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to promote trade and commerce with other countries and among the States in Australian wool to the advantage of Australian wool growers and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by means directed to encouraging and facilitating the purchase of Australian wool for the purposes of, or in the course of, that trade and commerce, and at the same time securing, in respect of wool purchased for the purposes of, or in the course of, that trade and commerce, prices that are not subject to undue fluctuation or irregularity and are at levels appropriate to the competitive position of wool in world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot alford to subsidise all sections of primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is indisputable that its unity will result in the bringing down of worthwhile legislation which will assist in offsetting the disastrous prices which are confronting the industry at present and affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its position in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the contribution that it makes to our export markets and our balance of trade are of tremendous importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese were prepared to walk out of negotiations because it suited their <span class="highlight">economy</span> to buy at this tower price because then they could play the price of our wood chips against the cost of wood chips that they could purchase elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the object of the clause is:  to promote trade and commerce with other countries and among (be States in Australian wool to the advantage of Australian wool growers and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by means directed to encouraging the facilitating and purchase of Australian wool for the purposes of, or in the course of, that trade and commerce, and at the same time securing, in respect of wool purchased for the purposes of, or in the course of, that trade and commerce, prices that are not subject to undue fluctuation or irregularity and are at levels appropriate to the competitive position of wool in world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We wish to ensure that this position does not arise and that a member is not placed in the position where he will have to find out whether his loyalties are to the Australian public, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Australian Wool Board or to the wool broking or wool buying firms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The selected members of the Commission at all times are in very responsible and very awkward positions as they try to administer things on behalf of Australian wool growers and with advantage to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister undertake to request his government to conduct a searching inquiry with a view to restoring price control where necessary in order to control exorbitant profits and thus restore some semblance of stability to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill does not include a guaranteed covering the cost of production.I emphasise that in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Reserve Bank should he instructed to cover the sum of $ 1 1 5m that will be involved in establishing the scheme as well as the$18.7m annual operating cost of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After ali, this Bill is because of its effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for the benefit of the people of Australia and not just the wool growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that I entirely agree with the proposal put by  Senator Lawrie  that if there is to be a proposition for a working week of so many hours it would apply in the rural area, and the rural area is vital to the whole Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that any effect on our rural industries affects the whole of Australia because we export and we depend on our export capacity for the security of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or is the Government admitting that the questions of standard hours and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> are matters for determination by industrial tribunals or negotiation between particular interests, as has applied in respect of the stevedoring authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible that this $60m could flow into other areas of speculation which could affect the stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is an expert on matters of management, employment and <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a position where, because of the general development in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the inducements to work outside the Services are greater than those to work inside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator that the latter question has received serious consideration by the Department and the answer in favour of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency invariably is returned in support of major works being done by contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister replied that a study which the Department had made on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency of such a scheme indicated that it could not compete with private contractors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something is wrong with the Department if it cannot compete with private enterprise in the building field because of lack of <span class="highlight">economy</span> or efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a lack of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency, it cannot compete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot compete in efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> with private builders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department says it cannot compete in <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency wilh private builders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>6m, <span class="highlight">economy</span> was achieved by transferring plans that had been developed for a similar building in Brisbane and adapting those plans to the site in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say for  Senator Mulvihills  satisfaction that the Board has been responsible for evolving research that has been of invaluable <span class="highlight">economy</span> in road construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, the Government had to have regard to its obligation to maintain a balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another question, which I mentioned at the outset is whether in a country such as Australia we should not be developing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be noticed too that this heavy commitment is a great liability on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thereafter our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, both industrial and rural, improved to the stage at which we were attracting to Australia more migrants per capita of the former population than was any other State in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we were able to absorb that very high degree of migrant intake, to have full employment and to have the <span class="highlight">economy</span> rising very nicely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the best of endeavours over a couple of decades, with a rising <span class="highlight">economy</span> and with that realisation of the State having to cut its coat in accordance with the cloth available to it, we held costs down in our State to such a degree that we were behind other States in certain services, although through this careful atten tion to the financial structure of the State we were able to have a wage rate slightly lower than that of other States but a more effective pay packet, which attracted industry to the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am very pleased that the Grants Commission, in determining South Australia’s requirements as being beyond that which it received from the normal reimbursements and grants, is putting South Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> into a condition which compares very favourably with that of other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this document now before us we see the very foundation of a system which is doing a great deal for our overall <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  recently spoke  to  the nation  on  the state  of the  <span class="highlight">economy</span> and on the likely  inflationary  effects of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission’s award  of a  6 per cent increase in wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement could be interpreted to mean also that the Government is content to allow the pensioners to live in their stale of penury because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> might be disturbed by a dispensation of justice to the aged, the invalid and the widowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these actions have done nothing to emphasise the need for <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the inflationary era which has arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These cannot be met in full without straining the <span class="highlight">economy</span> unduly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have built into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the Western world, in particular, a system whereby people can look after themselves by way of profits or through the arbitration court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Australia the trade union movement has been able to look after its members, to some degree, by appearing before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and making a very careful analysis of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of price rises against demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us realise that pensions are a part of the general <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a desire for <span class="highlight">economy</span> would naturally influence that aim, will the Minister undertake, to direct his departmental officers in the appropriate sections of his Department that at all times, and subject to economic consider.ations, when carrying out work in rural towns or rural areas goods and services available in the: immediate1 area are to be used? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it docs settle back it may not settle back to around the  2i  or 3 per cent to which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has grown fairly inured but instead it may settle down somewhere between the old rate and 7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the problem is masked fairly badly by 2 things, one of which is the 2 pay packet <span class="highlight">economy</span> in our community and the other is hire purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the pensioner is anticipating a rise in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of about  2i  per cent in a certain 12 months, he has to wait for that 12 months before he gets it and now he should get this  H  per cent rise in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been allowed to deteriorate now for a very long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether and, if so, to what degree the boom is being generated by a war <span class="highlight">economy</span> is one of the worries in what is otherwise a very happy boom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because it refuses to face up to the difficult problem of controlling inflation as an issue in its own right, it will contribute to an intensification of the structural distortions which are beginning to plague the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely there would be then a finer tuning of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to take off excess profits rather than allow the high profits to which we have become accustomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the fast moving <span class="highlight">economy</span> of today I issue the warning that that could happen very much sooner than the Government expects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> belongs to everybody and should not be used for political capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we on the Government side say on this subject is that the Budgets in 1969 and 1970 were framed in the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> likely to move on an expansionary course in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was very interested in the way in which the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  approached the question of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by making such a short and concise statement to the House of Representatives on Tuesday evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that the Prime Minister approached this situation on the basis of concern at what was going to happen to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and not the present position of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are a number of indicators which show us whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in an inflationary condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What are the indicators to be used in determining the position of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>5m which the Government will have saved by its reductions will be swamped by the extra amount which comes into Australia this year in this small sector of the financial <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone would dispute that the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> - for that matter, any nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> - is the most important subject with which the Parliament could concern itself and which it could discuss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone agrees that inflation is an evil which befalls our <span class="highlight">economy</span> periodically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If left unbridled, it could destroy the stability of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and bring about the worst thing that could befall us, that is, a depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition rightly introduces this matter of the state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> for discussion but it introduces it in a most unusual way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put to  Senator Wilkinson  who is with us in the chamber and to his Party that the honourable senator did not discuss at any point the unwise and panic measures of the Government in dealing with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The performance of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> during 1969 and early 1970 was marked by severe inflationary pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also suggest to honourable senators that one of the documents which was of great benefit to members of the Parliament was the 1970 White Paper on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and I would like to refer to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Profit margins, interest rates, taxes and charges all have a direct part, in determining the cost levels within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, proportionately, can do as much to raise costs as wage movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer, as  Senator Gair  did, to the fact that because of the form of the motion before the Chair we have been forced into a debate on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation in which back benchers are allowed only a quarter of an hour in which to make their contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been stated, in reply to that complaint, that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  took only 10 minutes to speak to the House of Representatives on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister had previously addressed the nation on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on television and then, when the Parliament met, he made a statement on the action that the Cabinet had decided to take in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to fight inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It Was never suggested that his statement to the Parliament on that evening would be a state of the nation message or a discourse on the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to dismiss that argument completely, because of the pressure of time, by reminding him that the system adopted in this country is far less inflationary and hazardous to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> than the application of the law of .the jungle to the industrial world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government of the Commonwealth ought to know and it should be able to tell us this when it is talking about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is so much smaller it is so much more sensitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any instability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> disrupts the whole business life of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ultimately it is able to create a source of labour which can be engaged in more productive enterprises and so increase the volume of production in this country to absorb the surplus money and credit that is available for the purchase of goods within our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it will achieve some small measure of control over inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet speculative companies which are in business for no purpose other than the buying and selling of shares may borrow $9m without restraint from the Government, which is supposed to be managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Prime Minister announced that he would make a television appearance and tell the nation about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> I thought we would all learn something, but we did not learn anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore so long as there are inflationary tendencies in other countries we will have to face pressures upon our own <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the intervening years the situation has been that the laws of Australia have been used to prevent sheep breeders exporting sheep which have done a magnificent job for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware of the extreme resentment felt by Service personnel at the cancellation of inter-Service sports events on the grounds of budgetary <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he, in the interests of Service morale, evolve a more equitable form of <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will leave sport meetings on their former basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONI have made some inquiries on this matter and have been given a fairly long brief but [ think the substance of the reply that I should give to the honourable senator is that I do not have at this point full particulars regarding the cancellation of the sporting events, but 1 am informed by the Services that the measures’; mentioned were taken by them with due ‘regard to the Government’s call for increased productivity and <span class="highlight">economy</span> where possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and it relates to the statements by the Prime Minister and other Ministers including himself about the inflationary trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which very strong criticism of wage increases was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s stated policy of cooling down the overheated <span class="highlight">economy</span>, can he inform the Parliament whether the Government has any plans to declare hire purchase companies hanking institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result is that the apparent conclusion reached is that, provided adequate provision is made for re-hearing if necessary, the method of service provided for in the proposed amendment is the best method to be adopted in the interests of efficacy, <span class="highlight">economy</span> and convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of language but with an absolute simplicity and clarity and purpose, the Minister has justified these provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive at present to help control the inflation that is current in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government suggests that it is seriously concerned with the rising rate of inflation, although I cannot see how, with an expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span> with full employment, an increasing population wilh an increasing demand for consumer goods and a population with little or no desire to work and of spendthrift habits in excessive gambling, drinking and smoking, we can avoid inflationary pressures, 1 simply ask the Prime Minister: Will he and his Government give serious and favourable consideration to bringing in a Bill to reduce parliamentary salaries by 10 per cent or lake steps to reduce other allowances by 20 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What flows from it is the restraint which it will encourage, the example which it will set in the community at large in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and the benefit it will bring to the housewife and, in fact, to everybody who is confronted with the problem of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister get a report on the situation with a view to inaugurating a plan to preserve this important part of Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to ensure that this section of the wool industry does not fade out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance was one of a series of measures designed to stimulate demand and restore confidence in the future growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and was particularly directed to encouraging expenditures on equipment and re-equipment of manufacturing industries which were then at a low ebb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  wishes to launch an <span class="highlight">economy</span> campaign he could cut down the staff of the Public Service by half and save $2m straight away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often our good friends from other parts of Australia do not properly understand the economic condition of the sugar industry and the role it plays in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that our good friends in other parts of Australia are conscious of the great role the sugar industry is playing in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general, and in the settlement and the maintenance of settlement over the continent of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cuba is what might be called a sugar <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if it becomes a matter of the preservation of a major industry such as this - and it is responsible for the settlement of a large area, of the continent of Australia - Australia will have to be regarded as what might be called a single industry <span class="highlight">economy</span>, just as Cuba is regarded in that sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the deep concern of wide sections of the Australian public about current trends in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will the Minister endeavour to prevail upon his colleague the Treasurer to make a detailed and comprehensive statement to the Parliament on the present state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thereby provide much needed reassurance to the Australian community that the difficulties being encountered over wide sections of national endeavour are not as serious as they appear to be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed works will provide a high degree of protection for areas subject to periodic minor- and nuisance flooding., and will make an important contribution towards strengthening the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of coastal areas of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add for my own part that I believe there is a ready acceptance all over Australia and throughout the world that the price of wool is very low and represents a very serious threat to our wool industry and to the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has a relationship with that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the actual situation in relation to the letting of contracts for Commonwealth public works since the introduction of what has become known as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive to reduce the incidence of inflationary tendencies in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have contracts continued to be entered into where tenders had already been called prior to the introduction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Rae concerning a reduction in public works expenditure in certain capital cities consequent upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of years the international airlines have offered a 30 per cent rebate on the normal <span class="highlight">economy</span> class fare to bona fide groups of 15 persons, all members of the one organisation, satisfying the eligibility and affinity conditions laid down by the International Air Transport Association - IATA, as it is known - travelling together on scheduled services between Australia, on the one hand, and Europe via Asia or North America and the Middle East on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the approval of all governments concerned, this extension of the affinity group scheme will come into effect on 1st April and will provide for eligible passengers, for example, a Sydney to London return fare of $730.70 compared with the full <span class="highlight">economy</span> rate of $1,304.80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time we are finding that there is more money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than there was intended to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But having looked at the effects of this legislation and examined the principle of this taxation concession in the generality and in its effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> I am highly doubtful whether we should have contemplated the legislation in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This process is distorting the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of farming industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will be improved by the elimination of the allowance for depreciation in calculating assessable income is, in my view, to advocate the ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to keep a buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to give encouragement to those who are prepared to lay out capital in order to keep modern and competitive I hope that the word ‘suspension’ is real when it is applied to this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hoping that in this period this company which has control of practically all the sales of this commodity in this country will be able to claim that through the assistance the Government has given it in the past it is possible for the company lo produce competitively a commodity which contributes to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country without the assistance of bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the reason also is likely to.be the fact that the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> is hot having a very easy time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of this programme will necessarily depend upon the recently announced policy of the Government to secure <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Government expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are to keep people on the land in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we practice today, this amounts to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why our Party has always said that unless the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> is closely examined and is given a new look in the light of our approach to the new world, we will continue to have these crises and the Parliament will continually be asked to try to retrieve a desperate situation and to succour the dying rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate,  Mr Deputy President,  that I am perhaps painting a rather broad canvas, but the wheat industry is one of the great examples of the basic and fundamental difficulties besetting the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am indicating that our plans are for total restructuring of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have suggested that there should be constituted an expert commission of inquiry into the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That commission would examine the importance of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, its role and its function in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed rural commission of inquiry would necessarily face an immense task because of all the elements which go to constitute the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> and on which its welfare, viability and national value depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have to be an inquiry which would assist to charter the course of our rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> at least into the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have to accept the fact of a rapidly changing national <span class="highlight">economy</span> in its relation to a changing world <span class="highlight">economy</span> and new and changing patterns of consumer demand throughout the world, particularly in the developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it would have to embrace in a fairly wide spectrum all those areas of life associated with the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fifthly, sanctions have created strains on the Southern Rhodesian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly on its balance of payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government interest rates on housing are clearly tied to Government policy and depend on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate follows the questions asked of him by  Senator Murphy  and  Senator McManus  concerning the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to this, will the Minister ask the Treasurer to place before both Houses of Parliament a White Paper on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally setting out the steps that are likely to be taken by the Government to combat inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be almost criminal if we were to leave the national capital without the Parliament having had an opportunity to deal with one of the most serious problems of our time and to give its opinions on what should be done in relation to the inflationary trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister mentioned the importance of the industry to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the industry can come up with something that will be of great assistance not only to the growers but to the Austraiian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party still persists in ils belief that it will be necessary to examine the role of each industry in the rural segment in order to determine what assistance - financial and technological - is required to enable it to discharge its proper and newly determined role in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> in relation to the consumption of rural products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The charter flying concession is one which gives in a full aircraft a fare structure of 55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> class fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware of the severe effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of certain municipal areas in Australia which are from time to time affected by flooding? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be easily able to bear the cost of such a scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this matter is referred to the Committee, I imagine it will go through the proposals in full, but I believe that they indicate that a national superannuation scheme based on moderate contributions and bearing worthwhile benefits is practical and desirable and can easily be borne by the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recall the statement by the former Treasurer who said that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was so finely balanced that an increase of 50c a week for pensioners would seriously affect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we had a debate on this matter earlier in this session I touched on the across the board increase of  6  per cent granted by the Commission and said that in my opinion the Commission was taking control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that any court should be in control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surely the right of the Parliament to exercise that control and it is the will of the people that the Parliament should control the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that this would be putting our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the charge of people outside this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government carries its so-called, <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures to the extreme in some directions, but it is not prepared to make concessions to those most in need in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> should not need a great deal of adjustment for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When, a few months earlier, John Gorton, the then Prime Minister said that he would have liked to increase pensions but he could nol do so because of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> his loyal supporters decided that they should get on the same wave length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that period, if there is one distinctive and abiding achievement to which every Australian can point and from which every Australian can draw benefit, it is the financial management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which successive governments have given in the last 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a positive achievement of the Liberal and Country Party governments over the last 21 years that they have given to Australians security in their employment and a financial management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has prevented the excesses which it was the concern of the government in the 1940s to avoid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those are areas in which the Government is endeavouring to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to reduce the rate of inflation, to control in some way the demand pressures and to endeavour to take action in the areas where prices would otherwise be rising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As transport is such an integral part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and as the Commonwealth indirectly has to reimburse the States for much of the deficits they suffer as a result of losses on their railway systems, one would assume that the Commonwealth would have taken a greater interest over the years to endeavour to co-ordinate the activities of our transport system and to assist the States in not simply eliminating their deficits but in eliminating the inefficiencies which obviously exist within those systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a matter to which the Government has given close thought, but the conclusion that it has reached is that, as this legislation is intended to assist in warding off the present inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, provision for interim exemptions pending determination of applications would be inappropriate in that it would have the effect of unduly deferring the really effective date of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have now reached the stage of economic development after monetary collapses and after a depression such as we had in the 1930s when mankind has realised he must have a central governing authority and not a laissez-faire system by which any financier can control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but it shall be a government responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intention of the Australian Labor Party to oppose this measure because it feels that the importance of the Tariff Board is being underestimated as a part of the machinery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the Board is not able to fulfil its growing importance because of factors which I will proceed to outline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is being underestimated by the Government as a part of the machinery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The selection in the past has been for the purpose of bringing in representatives of various sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the financial system so that the Board can have the benefit of the full range of the backgrounds and individual knowledge of members of the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are so many important parts of this whole tariff problem that we have to take into consideration the whole of the impact the work of the Tariff Board has on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is within the Board’s power to have a first hand evaluation of an industry, but there does not seem to be any method of carrying on from that point to determine the impact on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> further down the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information on the rapidly changing pressures that are on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be available to the Tariff Board through researchers and economic advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of it being more or less a sideline of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> I believe it should be an important linchpin in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the evaluation of the ever changing factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates that although the Board already has the power to delegate its authority to a single member inquiry which may accelerate the examination of references, nevertheless this important part of the machinery of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been underestimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, we of the Australian Labor Party have decided to oppose this measure for the purpose of highlighting the need for a complete reassessment and re-evaluation of the activities of the Tariff Board so that it can become an even more valuable contributor to the information needed for the administration of the very fluid <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we have in this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Board should investigate the areas of industry which may have a greater influence on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and not necessarily select an industry simply because it appears to have what some consider is a high protective rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that  Senator O’Byrne  was criticising the Government when he said that it under-estimates the Tariff Board as a machine in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be possible to demonstrate that savings to the community may be gained from a lower level of protection being granted to some industries, there being greater competition being created within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speak briefly about what happened following, the introduction of Australian crude oil to local refineries, coupled with the policy of the suppliers of Bass Strait crude oil in relation to the marketing of liquefied petroleum gas, which policy is costing our <span class="highlight">economy</span> millions of dollars a year, principally in those areas where we can least afford it, namely, rural activities and decentralised industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that I have amply indicated the valuable properties of this gas and the part it plays in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but what is the position today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few aspects that I propose to mention because I feel that there are some matters which are very dangerous to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>’ and of particular concern to our cherry growing industry, quite apart from industries engaged in the glazing and crystallising of cherries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which benefits most from tariff protection is undoubtedly manufacturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to manufacturing industry in particular, and the role of manufacturing in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that consideration must be given in any appraisal ; of tariff policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sugar requirement is endangered because the Government’s decision will affect not only cherry growers in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria but also the Queensland sugar industry, which is an essential part of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally, and the’ cherry growing industry particularly, that we stress to the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony),  firstly, that every consideration be given to the great importance of retaining the cherry industry in  a  viable position by ensuring that it has reasonable protection, and secondly, that an opening should be left to the industry for cherries surplus to fresh fruit consumption to be used for brining, crystallising and glazing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of motion add -  , but the Senate ls of the opinion that there should be constituted an expert Commission ot Inquiry into the whole structure of the Rural <span class="highlight">Economy</span> which would examine its importance, its role and its function in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and in particular examine the following subjects: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the wage structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present situation is not so much a problem for the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> as it is a social catastrophe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that amendment we will call for an inquiry by a commission of experts into the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry would examine the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s importance, its role and its function in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have to accept the fact of a rapidly changing national <span class="highlight">economy</span> in its relation to a changing world <span class="highlight">economy</span> and new and changing patterns of consumer demand throughout the world, particularly in the developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another acutely depressing factor in the consideration of the future of Australia’s rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> which at present is heavily dependent upon markets overseas, especially for wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for these reasons that we urge the adoption of our proposal for a commission to inquire into the whole rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commission of inquiry will examine rural producers’ cost, taking into account the Australian tariff; government policies and other factors tending to raise costs in Australia; the incidence of railway freights on rural producers in comparison with urban charges; road transport; and the wage structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and all of the people were then suffering from depression but today the situation in rural areas is aggravated by the fact that the cities are enjoying a great measure of prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are experiencing a so-called booming <span class="highlight">economy</span> in some sectors and the present difficulties arise primarily from inequalities within the farming community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is serious not only to those directly employed in the industry but to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are suffering because our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in 2 compartments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in the present state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the atmosphere of general affluence which exists in the community we failed to give a reasonable increase we would be failing in our duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During 1969-70 the overall picture was a rise in output and employment and, with the exception of some sections of the rural sector, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in a strong position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After saying that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in a strong position the Commission, in the next paragraph or so, says that it was in ari inflationary condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not consider that the situation of rural industries is such that it should be used to deny an increase to wage earners generally when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in an overall strong position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After saying, prior to that statement, that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in an inflationary condition the Commission ends up by saying that the increase is justified because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in an overall strong position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that if demands are not restrained the position could be deleterious to the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if New Zealand sent electric shavers into Australia, would they be seriously detrimental to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is very deleterious to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has its effect also on city dwellers and on the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator told the Senate, our projected amendment to the first Bill contemplates the creation of a commission of inquiry into the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have spelt out on many occasions and in many documents and statements the reasons which prompt us to refer the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> to an expert commission of inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be immediate relief for those industries and the people engaged in them but there must also be some attempt to examine the whole rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> to see how it is going to adjust to the new world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, this is such a major problem - it is going to involve the restructuring of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> for many years to come - that it would be foolish to presume that the suggested commission of inquiry would not have to be an inquiry of great magnitude and of considerable length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this is going to be a continuing process, resulting in a continuing drain on the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and revenue, unless the problem is tackled at the base, right at the grass roots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, what prompts us to do this is the need for a basic investigation of the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party feels that ultimately the Government and those who do not see my Party’s way at the moment will come down to an acceptance of its proposition as the only real, practical, forward looking proposition encompassing the whole of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators were to refer to the circulated copy of the Democratic Labor Party’s proposed amendment they would find that, under the heading of rural producers costs, it takes into account the Australian tariff, Government policies and other factors tending to raise costs in Australia, the incidence of railway freight on rural producers in comparison with urban charges, road transport and the wage structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we contemplate is a completely new method under a completely new corporation to provide finance in the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament would be doing less than its duty if it merely tried to heal these wounds by a process of healing by first intention without examining the base troubles at the very bottom of the structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless wage levels for Papuans and New Guineans are related to local conditions and the Territory’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Territory will have no propect of becoming economically self-reliant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To attract Australians to service in the Territory for as long as they are needed, earnings of Australians there have to be related to wage levels in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This country has been fortunate in having both a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a stable government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these people - either those who stay within the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or those who because of the financial policy pursued by this Government, are being forced to get off their properties - are entitled to receive assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that all of these people and all of their problems have to be catered for if there is to be any justice or any common sense brought to bear in relation to the rural sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask  Senator Young:  What hope will these people have of getting any assistance from the private banks in Australia when the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation is in its present state and when all the forecasts by Government spokesmen indicate that the position will get worse? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through a sympathetic acceptance of a difficult situation and a preparedness to act in the way provided for in these 2 Bills, I feel that we can emerge to a condition wherein the 2 sectors of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, complementary one to the other, can ensure the general welfare of the people of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that here today we are doing something of real importance in endeavouring to maintain a situation wherein we retain a balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been such an effluxion of time and the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been poised on a razor’s edge and been so finely balanced over the years, that we cannot permit this sort of thing to go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have made observations about this particular part of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> - this essential and terribly important part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>; this section of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> upon which, it may well be argued, this nation has grown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was our primary industries that raised the overseas capital which enabled Australia to expand in the field of secondary industry, and allowed us to develop other sections of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and proceed to this stage of our growth and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those producers who for three-quarters of a century have been the mainstay of Australia’s export income and upon whose effort this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been built face at this time the lowest prices for their products ever known in that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply an exercise in semantics to saythat the Labor Party wants to withdraw the Bill merely to redraft it because everybody knows that the House of Representatives has risen and the practical effect of carrying the Labor Party’s amendment would be, in truth and in fact, to deny this money to the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government considers also that there are better ways of providing assistance to the primary producers than allowing a low interest rate to be fixed which may distort the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That position has now arisen.I move the following amendment: At the end of motion add - but the Senate is of the opinion that there should be constituted an expert Commission of Inquiry into the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> which would examine its importance, its role and its function in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and in particular examine the following subjects: (a) Expected export demand for Australian rural products, taking into account: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the wage structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That motion was for a reference of the state of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> to a committee of this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two things illustrate just what are the additionally serious problems which are now facing the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to have set up an expert commission of inquiry into the whole structure pf rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that our proposal that the whole of the problems of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, be referred to an expert commission of inquiry involved a long range investigation and was not a short term solution to these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely want to point out that we realised that, and we stated very definitely that we thought the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in such a condition that it had to be investigated from the bottom to the top over the whole depth of its structure but that we realised also that that would necessarily be a long range investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, as we said, the intention was to project the future of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> up to the year 2000 and as that would necessarily be rather poor consolation to farmers in financial difficulties it is for that reason that on the other leg of our presentation we submitted the propositions which are contained in the amendment moved by my colleague  Senator Kane  and seconded by  Senator Little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We trust that honourable senators, conscious of the real, demanding and urgent needs of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will find in these propositions some attempt to discover a solution to the problems of the farmers and will find it possible to support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We impose what is in effect a capital gains tax on the value of an estate accumulated at the point of death, paying no regard at all to the sort of estate or its position in relation to the general <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is up to us in this Senate chamber, irrespective of party,  10  do what we can to assist the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of estate duty goes further than rural industries; it flows right through the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and it is necessary for us to do all we can in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of no good preventing the control of certain types of public companies from moving outside Australia if the control of this type of operation, which can be absolutely fundamental to the strength of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is not controlled by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as possible the- Government must always try to be in advance of the ingenious internationalist who might try, until the law is changed or tightened, to circumvent this depredation upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made clear the importance it attaches to flows of capital from abroad for the development of our resources and of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some talk of a court case by the Victorian Government to determine whether or not it was right, just and legal to levy a payroll tax which was a war time measure introduced for the purposes of carrying a wartime <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> we are already loaded to the full with those types of taxes that are dishonest in their fundamental principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We heard stories about the Commonwealth Government being so foolish, so ill advised or so heedless of advice, as to contemplate again loading the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> with turnover taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation is intended to assist in warding oft present inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter to which the Government has given close thought, but the conclusion that it has reached is that, as this legislation is intended to assist in warding off the present inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, provision for interim exemptions pending tha determination of applications would be inappropriate in that it would have the effect of unduly deferring the really effective date of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have that effect but the principle is too great to make it merely the timetotime plaything of a government of one complexion or another which might say: This is a method by which we can control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are certain recognised classical methods of controlling the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that is, through the control of credit, fiscal control and monetary and banking control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps by proper operation of the Bill it will at all times have the consequence that it will stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, because that is the very nature of the principle embodied in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could lose out on the good things which free enterprise has done for our <span class="highlight">economy</span> because we have not retained a width of competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all its statements on economic matters in this Parliament the Commonwealth admits that it has the responsibility to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation, and I support that view, lt is able to fix rates of interest through the Reserve Bank of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed out that these days when people on average wages are living on a very fine knife edge of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and there are no margins for these delays, even on the occasion where a man loses 2 or 3 days work because of some minor injury and questions tha delays associated with claim payments, he unconsciously gets behind in his various instalment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Albeit, the figures of unemployment across Australia are very low and, having regard to the nature of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the fact that ours is a primary producing country, apart from isolated areas, they represent a state of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am one of those people who believe that a trade union or any other organisation is quite entitled to express its opinion on any matter, but when it converts that opinion into an onslaught on the general community and on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, when these people inflict hardship upon their fellow workers and fellow men in an attempt to advance a particular political view I do not go along with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anticipated expenditure on repair and overhaul of aircraft engines at Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation has been reduced by about $400,000 for the period to the end of June 1971, by a combination of the phasing out of service of the RAAF Sabre aircraft with <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All 1 can say is that in the presentation of the Budget last week significant advances were made, consistent with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s capacity to bear them, in social service pensions and in endowment paid for the second child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought the fact that the Government has discharged a measure of responsibility to the pensioners and to people with families consistent with its obligations to the overall <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the surest indication that the people of Australia will be saved the prospect of a Labor government in years hereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the dollar crisis has been in operation for almost  a  fortnight, and in view of his evasive replies - on behalf of the Government of course - on the subject, will he now admit that the Government has no more control over the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> than it has over Australian foreign policy and that our future depends largely on decisions outside our control and made by other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious, I should think, to every citizen of the country that rapidly accelerating inflationary trends are developing in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>on the other hand, treat social service increments as something to be adjusted according to alterations in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as an inescapable national obligation to that  section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We get the balance by productivity in a developed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with the confidence that in the next year the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have grown to such an extent that the Government will have not only increased taxes to rely upon but also an increased yield brought about by productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the wool industry plays such a large part in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this great nation - in some years over 50 per cent of our total export earnings came from wool - it is imperative that we look after it so that it may play a great part in the development of the nation in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Government believes there is inflation in the community it has decided that the people who will pay and who will deflate our <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be, not the people who have it, but the people who do not have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trade union movement will never reach the situation where it will sit idly by and allow its membership throughout the community to absorb all the increased costs which are built up by a system which has allowed inflation into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today as a society we have almost reached the stage - in country  areas  we have reached the stage - where severe depressions are operating within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say that when those wages become fictitious, when all they represent is inflation and when they advance at a greater rate than production advances, then that does harm and damage to the whole of the community and the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is unfortunate that the control of some unions is in the hands of people who have a vested interest in the breakdown of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will never admit today that the Labor Government was correct in using economic controls in a wartime <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite confident that this Government, which has done so much for
            Australia in a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> and free enterprise system, would have no wish to do any
            less in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tendency to
          look at them as some small and unimportant factor in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and as an unimportant
          instrument, fiscally or economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another very flexible factor, but one which makes an enormous impact upon
          the state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a system which I infinitely respect and
          one which, by its decisions in wage fixing, by its decisions in fixing margins for skill
          and by the results of flow-ons and over-award payments, has a profound effect both in
          the redistribution of income in Australia - and I respect that - and upon the price and
          cost structure of the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The
          Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee watch over accounting and expending,
          but in the final analysis electorates and States must rely on their Commonwealth
          parliamentary representatives to ensure that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> runs as smoothly as possible,
          particularly at times such as these when inflationary pressures within and uncertainty
          without make long range predictions extremely difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any government
          has only so much money to spend on the various aspects of the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Treasurer on the general responsibility of his
          Budget, which I am sure will stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can a government
          get a balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span> when it will tie only one end of it, and that is the wages end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one thinks of the incredible change which has taken place in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>

  <li>
    <p>We are undergoing a fundamental reconstruction
          of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be summed up as the enormous and
          fundamental impact that it is having and will have on the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently 1 asked a question as to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and I pointed out to the Minister for Works  (Senator Wright),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Labour and National Service, that the Department of Labour and National Service had or was preparing to have food and employment vouchers published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Territory air fares are among the highest in the world; all travel is charged at first class rates (there is no <span class="highlight">economy</span> fare available) which are much higher, mile for mile than charges in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make a few general observations in regard to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and leave the detailed aspects of the Budget to the more appropriate time of Committee consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the fact that inflationary tendencies within our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, present and potential, fairly give me the horrors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essentially a Budget framed to meet a situation in which inflationary forces in Australia are of a strength and character which could be a potential danger to the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is high time that we recognised that we have been singularly fortunate in Australia to have encompassed over the past couple of decades a period of outstanding national development, without the adverse experience of so called stagflation - a situation experienced by some other countries of comparative stagnation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but at the same time with a high degree of inflation and simultaneously a high level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see the highest wage levels the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can provide, but the wage has to be effective in purchasing power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is not to be wondered at that the Government is concerned about the present general situation within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the red warning lights are flashing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that governments can achieve all of the things which are necessary to ensure a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that both management and labour have yet to learn to operate responsibly and effectively “in a full employment <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a reflection of the progress that has been made in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> through the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation does not give rise to any optimistic ideas that we can allow out costs to escalate merrily on the home <span class="highlight">economy</span> and still expect our balance of payments via exports not to be seriously detrimented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not afford cost increases of those dimensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in the present very strong state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the implementation of such a policy may lead to a betterment of the individual’s position generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that in the presentation of the Budget last week significant advances were made, consistent with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s capacity to bear them, in social service pensions and in endowment paid for the second child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the easing in the labour market has occurred in what were overheated areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must come back to the answer that I have given in the past, that the movement of the interest rate is an instrument of government which is used because of its effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fact is that the incidence and the effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the interest rate is a matter of Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not peculiar to Australia for interest rates to be used and varied to regulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been known to vary the interest rate twice or even three times within a financial year because, in its judgment, the interest rate has a significant application on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to what action would be taken in relation to any significant movement in unemployment figures or job opportunity figures, I think we all recognise that in an <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly an <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as Australia’s where we have the ingredients of primary industry, industrialisation and a migration policy, this is not a precise science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assess the stability not only of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> but of our social structure and also how much we need for our social development and the wellbeing of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget, while it is not all things to all men, plays a very important role in the total <span class="highlight">economy</span> and has become a regulator of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the Commission should make decisions which reflect the needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget strategy becomes critically important in the Government’s policy to combat the inflationary forces that are now running in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that there will be a continuing inquiry into this segment of Australian industry, particularly in South Australia, so that this industry may take its place with the other industries in the Australian community, particularly the rural industries, and continue its growth and contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that as the demands and the pressures are applied to the Commonwealth, whether in payments to the States, demands for increased welfare payments, or greater expenditure on defence or repatriation, consideration will be given to those demands but at the same time the restraints and the restrictions that have been placed upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> against the background of a world situation that is particularly difficult to comprehend, or even to judge, will be understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘The Treasury has shown an undue preoccupation with excess liquidity In ‘ the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of capital inflow, the high level of savings bank deposits and the flow-back of tax refunds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the Government has been persuaded to budget for  a  domestic surplus of S630 million knowing that this will result in  a  substantial withdrawal of liquidity from the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and act as a strong restraining factor on expenditure by the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That information appears on page 16 of the White Paper on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the years has absorbed a great deal of the wage increases by giving more attention to management, increased efficiency and greater use of capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of words I ask: When may I expect an answer to questions 1280 and 1326 on the notice paper? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONResponding with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of words, I will look at the questions to which the honourable senator has referred and I will try to give him an answer perhaps later in the day, and if not today, tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the sections of the Budget to which I shall direct attention indicate clearly that, rather than reducing cost pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Budget will have the adverse effect of increasing the cost structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases in radio and television licence fees will play their part in reducing disposable income, as will the proposed increases in postal, telephone and telegram charges which must be passed back into the total <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stripped of all the camouflage, what the Treasurer is really saying in the preamble and in the conclusion to his Budget Speech to justify the measures thai had been introduced, is that the Government’s attention has been oriented, by and large, to only one section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, namely, the wage and salary earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we believe the Budget will not discourage the real growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the ‘Australian’ of Friday, 10th September 1971 there appeared an article bearing the heading ‘100pc drop in new money for industry’ and the sub-heading ‘Figures show <span class="highlight">economy</span> is running down fast”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems that now is the right time for the Government to inject some renewed life into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to recall the reaction of the Government when the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, after a very extensive and minute examination of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and industry generally, made a decision on the basis that industry could pay an additional 6 per cent in the wage bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serious consideration should be given to the reduction of bank interest charges and an injection of finance into the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to help stimulate and revive a flagging <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will see cause to reverse the obvious trends which are ominous for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally and so allow a developing <span class="highlight">economy</span> to continue to expand in the best interests of the people as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to speak now for a moment on additional national development which is being injected into our <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the private sector through the mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It always became necessary to debase in some way the currency or to inflate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a means of paying for the tremendous wastage of war, and as a means of increasing the capacity of the nation to produce to meet the banked up demands that accrued in the period when mau was destroying rather than producing goods for consumption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the old days the balancing of a nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the conclusion of a war usually meant the addition of less valuable content to the metal money of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would bc in difficulties, I think, if we were to try to save a nation from collapsing as a result of inflation when the pressure is on us to try to preserve the purchasing power of our own <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What attracted the necessary basic finance to rebuild its <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is puzzled as to why there is an inflationary tendency in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its control of the interest rate, I am sorry to say, will not help to maintain in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> a level that will prevent inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would take issue with him and argue the matter because that is no longer the position in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, lt used to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government responsible for our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is labouring under the delusion that this still pertains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A feature of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over recent years has been the steadily increasing competition for available funds from both public and private borrowers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer admitted that the Government is running the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that it has done this to contain inflationary pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, those of us who have interested ourselves in the subject at all understand that movements in these areas must be slow and that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> must be given time to adapt itself to the circumstances of a change in interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1946, of course,  a  Labor Government unilaterally determined that what it had said was to be a temporary measure would be a permanent feature of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that he said was that we are losing sight of the fact that the moves being made by the United States of America in financial circles are likely to have more far reaching effects on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> than the Government realised when it was drawing up the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that in his opinion more emphasis should be placed on what is happening outside Australia than on what is happening inside Australia in order to correct the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we also see the necessity - it is becoming more apparent every day - of a fundamental examination of the whole rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there are problems in the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget not only does that in terms of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also it makes special concessions in relation to pensions and social service matters of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that no legislative matter arising from the Budget has as yet been passed by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament and that the Budget proposals have not as yet had sufficient time to have the slightest effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Works aware that as part of Government <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures the following skilled employees attached to the plant workshops, plant pool, Garbutt, Townsville, received notices of dismissal on Monday, 13th September: 4 mechanics, 1 welder, 1 lube attendant and i plant foreman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy has been to frame a Budget which would steady and stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is probably one of the soundest in the world, with an unemployment rate of less than 2 per cent, as I mentioned a day or two ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out on that occasion that in a vast continent like Australia, where as ingredients of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we have primary producing industries, manufacturing industries and a migration programme providing for a high intake of migrants, to all intents and purposes that unemployment rate is very close to full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsensical and infantile to think that we could have an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which the Government could lay down a policy, and then sit back believing that nothing would change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the limitation of 2 hours for debate, with no restriction on the number of participants in the debate - although the time allotted to individual participants is limited - can accomplish that <span class="highlight">economy</span> of time which is so important in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do persons become eligible for pensions because they reduce their savings; if so, does the Government consider this reduction of savings to be in the best interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did four mechanics, one welder, one lubrication attendant and one plant pool foreman, attached to the Plant Workshops, Plant Pool, at Garbutt, Queensland, receive notices of dismissal on 13th September 1971, as part of the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures; if so, will the Minister, us a matter of extreme urgency, cancel the dismissal notices so as to prevent the persons concerned from suffering severe hardship in an already seriously economically depressed area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is possible that a reduction in sleeper production may affect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of specific areas which are largely dependent on this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a reasonable return on capital employed is the best way of ensuring fair competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I believe that if the means were available and we could readily say that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> could afford it the case for a national superannuation scheme would be tremendously strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to assess from time to time whether or not the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country can afford such a scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the final analysis the Government has the responsibility to accept or reject the assessment of an independent tribunal and to decide whether an excessive demand would be made on the public purse in view of the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That assessment has been made in a most illogical, impractical, and even the Opposition would admit, inadequate manner by a Government that has all sorts of other responsibilities and apparently has not the time, if it has the desire, to make a thorough investigation required to arrive at an adequate and proper rate of pension, and the ability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sustain that rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether a modern <span class="highlight">economy</span> could exist without a measure of social service payments particularly to elderly and sick people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A modern <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not exist without such payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore do not think it can be fairly argued that the Opposition in moving its proposed amendment has not had regard to its responsibilities and the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand we have the rigid economic requirement within a given <span class="highlight">economy</span> to make use to the full of resources and at the same time we have this pressing need with care and consideration to go about the utilisation of our resources in such a way as will not be detrimental to our environmental situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe in the past we have, to a degree, suffered from economic indigestion through the intake of numbers which, at times, places on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> difficulties which lead to some concern as to how to encompass the situation in regard to costs and inflationary tendencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From this study we can work out what is the effect on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, what absorption capacity we have, the retention of living standards for our population and so on, then study the costs and benefits of immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In country towns a large part of the local <span class="highlight">economy</span> is built up around employees of the Postmaster-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If 40 employees are to be taken out of that small country town the backbone of the local <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I forecast that if this sort of non-planning continues for many more months the Government will go out of office, but the great tragedy is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will collapse while the Government is engaged in this sort of non-activity in all sections of the community, not only the Postal Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, the Gates Commission itself observed that in a growth <span class="highlight">economy</span> similar to our own civilian employment can be expected to be relatively more attractive than military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this community those who pay wages enable our <span class="highlight">economy</span> to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no qualification that under this form of tax a man who is paying a substantial payroll and contributing to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation is actually making a profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today we are on a swing in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which makes it very doubtful - particularly in industrial enterprises - whether many businesses are making a profit which is equivalent to the profit which can be derived by the direct investment of money in Commonwealth loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That would contravene the principle that  Senator Wilkinson  was speaking about when he said there would be a serious threat to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation if a tax were levied in some areas but not generally throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Second, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is heavily unionised and apprenticeship programmes requiring 4 or more years deplete the pool of men available for military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Third, Australia has enjoyed a rapid growth in its <span class="highlight">economy</span> (the unemployment rate is about 1 per cent)- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>May I direct the Minister’s attention to the statement of 12 professors, a report of which appears at page 31 of today’s Canberra Times’, pointing out the urgency for the Government to make a decision on the future of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when I point out that the industry has a history of over a century in Tasmania and has been developed, since the introduction of refrigerated shipping, principally for export and that the value of the industry to the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been in recent years between $16m and $20m annually, it will be appreciated just what the industry does mean to the island State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do you know whether this is part of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> campaign or is due to mechanical failure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the reason is <span class="highlight">economy</span>, could the Senate be informed what money has been saved in sacrificing the lovely vista once presented to Australian and overseas visitors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there have developed in the industry, firstly, freight demands that are very critical; secondly, internal production costs have dwarfed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this primary industry in comparison with the economies of other industries of Australia so as to reduce the apple and pear producer to a level of <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is not respectable from the point of view of parliamentary performance in relation to other strata of our people; thirdly, the industry is beset with unsurpassed marketing difficulties, accentuated by the probable advent of the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not opt for such a trip because I thought that in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of time of an election that commenced at 7 o’clock in the morning and concluded at 5 o’clock in the evening it was only fair that I should attempt to observe the election in the capital city, Saigon, as well as, and as far as possible, the operation of the election in one of the provincial areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As always the Government is maintaining a close and continuous examination of developments in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will be guided accordingly so far as future policy is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has, however, made it clear that it places great importance on the need for effective restrictive trade practices legislation to help bring about a more competitive atmosphere in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we should bear in mind that the increase was from 50c to$1 in terms of contemporary <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the exemptions which are written into the Bill are a reasonable proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the urgent matter thought out and decided upon for debate in order that the Opposition could delay debate on a Bill which is of importance to the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia, namely, the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who have been involved on the land for some part of our lives have been well aware that phosphate and phosphatic fertilisers have produced quite a dramatic revolution in the Australian agricultural and pastoral <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These fertilisers are quite essential to make the pastoral and agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not repeat the advantages of this change,  Mr Deputy President,  except to say that it is designed to improve the quality, the efficiency and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the service and it has been developed in the public and national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it is only a short Bill, I believe it is a measure that is of particular importance to not only the farming community and the industrial section of the meat industry but also the whole of the Australian community and the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister to recall that over the past few weeks I have asked questions about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the state of the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When are we likely to receive a statement on the position of the Australian dollar and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What effects will this reduction have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in particular, on development projects in northern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, earlier this month the Japanese Government introduced  a  supplementary budget designed to stimulate the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following this action, the Japanese Economic Agency, which advises the Government on economic matters, forecast that the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> should return to an annual growth rate of 10 per cent by mid-1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, it would appear that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not likely to suffer  a  serious set back from any short term reduced demand in Japan for the range of minerals which we supply  in  quantity to that market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think my colleague  Senator Wheeldon  fairly accurately described  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson’s contribution; end  Senator Sim  has just made a small contribution to the debate, but when he had to face a couple of interjections from my colleague  Senator Georges  he became like the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can become - rather overheated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One problem is that the United States is an enormous <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which, in relative terms, international trade does not loom so large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, we cannot afford to be complacent - the more so since, as the French Minister of Finance warned the Annual Meeting of the Fund in Washington, ‘the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> appears to have entered a stage of lessened growth in recent months.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And  ais  the Prime Minister said in his statement to th House on 26th August, any such decision will have only one proper basis - the interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Australian nation as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the last decades the wool industry has been the mainstay of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not long enough to determine a national policy with regard to the industry which for generations has been the mainstay of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing so we will retain a reasonable price for wool, otherwise we will have to face up to the complete disappearance of wool as a commodity and the complete disappearance of the industry which for so long has been the mainstay of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That proposition is in conformity with the opinion I have already expressed that many of the wool growers ultimately will need to be given the opportunity to diversify their type of production, which will probably require emergency capital and loans and may even require a moratorium on current debts to enable them to reestablish new forms of production or, if necessary, quit primary industry itself and became rehabilitated in some other form of activity which will enable them to play their part in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A major proportion of Australian sheep skins are exported to Europe and sold on a cost, insurance, freight and exchange basis which contributes considerably to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shorn skins carrying a short length of wool of less than 1 inch present an uneconomic proposition from both the handling and export points of view and they would therefore be dumped and lost to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have spoken of the effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in relation to export earnings, but let me point now to some far-reaching internal problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, due to the establishment of packing houses and their desire to assist the grower, as well as the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, they handle these uneconomic skins and average out over all types. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, last July at Ivanhoe in New South Wales a resolution was carried- by the Ivanhoe Woolgrowers Survival Committee that the members of that Committee are not prepared to tolerate any longer the incredible reluctance of the Federal Government - to quote the words in the resolution - to intervene and protect both the wool growers of Australia and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation from exploitation by the representatives of the wool textile industries and the speculators trading on the Australian wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the toilet paper supply for all public conveniences controlled by Treasury been withdrawn and replaced by a cheaper and greatly inferior grade of toilet paper as part of the Government <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive; if so, what will be the resultant savings for the balance of the current financial year and what will be the savings in a full year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The economist for the Australian Mutual Provident Society,  Dr Bell,  has stated that the intensity of industrialised concentration in this country is perhaps the highest in the world, with our <span class="highlight">economy</span> dominated by about 200 companies, of which 40 are titans of the business world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his book ‘Australian Monopoly Law’,  Dr Geoffrey  Walker refers to the 200 firms holding the bulk of economic power in the business sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and tells how this aggregate of power has not gone unexercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Prime Minister reconcile his statement which I quoted earlier with the Commissioner’s saying that the Act does not give him power to act against monopolies which take secret boardroom decisions to affect the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>, decisions which, as this one did, lifted inflation to a new plateau? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Commission could be expanded greatly it could eventually provide detailed information about the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>; information which could be used by such bodies as the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Tariff Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government really wants to use the High Court decision to introduce legislation effectively to bar restrictive practices - to practise what it preaches by laying the groundwork for a free <span class="highlight">economy</span> spurred by true competition - then the Attorney-General should study the legislation now before the Canadian House of Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that the Government, as quickly as possible and as far as possible within the administrative limits which are now available, will examine the operations of the principles of this type of legislation and their effect within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand that this type of legislation is now inbuilt into the disciplined <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we have come to accept and which all sections of the community now project as being the type of <span class="highlight">economy</span> desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There we see this tremendous rise in the degree of foreign control of Australia, particularly in the important segments of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> on which Australia is relying more and more today and will rely more and more in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, it must be assessed against the decline in the area of rural production where there is a vast translation of the very nature of the basic Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a process which will continue, which will accelerate and which will expand in that sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a situation where the accumulation of these monies is a potential embarrassment to a government trying to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because if those monies flow out into consumer goods the effect could greatly precipitate the inflationary process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard someone say the other day - I think it is perhaps true - that whilst enormous attention is paid to that 30 per cent or so of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is concerned with wages and the manufacturing industry as it affects wages, the real areas of softness where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sick are apart from that and are those areas in which restrictive practices are operating to make the <span class="highlight">economy</span> sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is suggested, in the interests of Australia, is that there are signs in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, on our share markets and in general economic activity, that over-investment of overseas capital in specific industries is reaching a point dangerous to the solidarity and the future wellbeing of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I suggest, with respect, whatever may be the fate of this proposal, in the national interest, in order to protect the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the councils, the governments who are being subjected to the restrictive practices in a situation where they are unlawful, where the consumers are being hurt by collusive tendering and collusive bidding against the Commonwealth law, that it is not too much to say that the traditional remedy which was in the Australian Industries Preservation Act, the American Acts, the Sherman Acts and others, should be availed of here so that there will be an incentive in the citizen to see to it that the illegal practices are stamped out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The business community as well as the consumers are saying: ‘Let us have some action against those who are entering into these restrictive practices, driving the smaller people out of business, forcing up prices and injuring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> right across the community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware also that from the point of view of not only the Australian market but also the overseas market this is a very important industry for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONThe honourable senator’s question relates to what has been termed classic fiscal policy, which means the manipulation of interest as part of adjustments to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, lt has been raised previously during this session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it would be very dangerous to argue, as the question seems to imply, that because the interest rate is lowered in certain parts of Europe it necessarily follows that this is a good thing for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that both at governmental level and in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there have been movements in the increase of the amount of loan that one could normally obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With S225m of revenue and over 12,750 employees, the company in many ways made, and will continue to make a substantial contribution to the country’s trade and national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inflow of such currency into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a small nation is very important when viewed against the need to maintain for defence purposes airfields, aircraft and equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there is the group of people who will travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class on what I call ‘scheduled carriers’ and ‘scheduled lines’, meeting the kind of programme that suits the airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The views are that these things are transitory and that very shortly there will be a return to vigorous activity in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> certainly needs a boost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential to the continued viability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter of pacifying the island State of Tasmania; it is a matter of retaining viability in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of all the integral parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the essential aspects of retaining viability in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania is that it have a transport system which overcomes its natural disability created by that stretch of water known as Bass Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As we seem to be in a time when all possible economies in government expenditure should be made, has the Government given due thought to having all Government employees travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class on aircraft inside and outside Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister advise the Senate how much money is spent by all Government departments on air travel inside and outside Australia each year and the likely saving if ail Government employees were to travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government consider the call by  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia, for an early Premiers Conference to consider ways of stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being so, all I can say is that the Government is aware of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; it has a responsibility to look to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As these retrenchments in the motor car industry follow the retrenchment of 600 workers from South Australian factories in September this year, will the Government take such action as is possible to assist the Australian motor car manufacturing industry to sustain its capacity and work force, including any rearrangement in respect of the importation of cars or by stimulating the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the relief of unnecessary distress by an immediate increase in unemployment benefits and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is near unanimity among economists, the financial editors of the major newspapers and leaders of industry that the difficulties which bedevilled the <span class="highlight">economy</span> before August last have now been compounded by the Government’s Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to put to him and his Government serious suggestions for immediate measures to relieve the hardship of growing numbers of the community and at the same time give a much needed fillip to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was required to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the growth of employment and productivity was that last August’s Budget should have been at least mildly expansionary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  muttering a lot of jeremiads about the alleged threat of a great outburst of demand inflation based on record savings in the banks, opted for a budget which provided no direct stimulus by way of expenditure to the level of activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result has been that Australia has joined the stagflation club; that is, it has addedto the evils of inflation the stagnation of its <span class="highlight">economy</span> and mounting unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was intended to be one which would contract the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we will strike that contraction next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this Budget was intended to contract the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that we will suffer from this miscalculation that has been made by the Federal Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The figures show an extremely unpleasant and dangerous trend in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Each year this Institute, which has as its members some of Australia’s most distinguished economists and has a most capable research staff, publishes in April and October short term forecasts of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which have come to be accepted as among the most authoritative in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, even if economic policies were reversed immediately, little effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could be expected in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case honourable senators on the Government side should feel inclined to ridicule this suggestion as coming from ‘just another bunch of academic economists’, let me remind them that it was just this bunch of academic economists which warned before the Budget of the dangers of an unduly restrictive Budget strategy; it was they who pointed to the signs of a downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which evidently escaped the attention of the Government and its Treasury advisers in shaping this disastrous Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could not have any cost-push inflationary effect as increases in unemployment benefits and pensions do not add to the cost of production, lt would increase the flow of money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and therefore stimulate demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bank in i”.s November publication of “Business Indicators’ shows a disheartening reflection of the widespread pessimism afflicting our <span class="highlight">economy</span>- today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should put the money into the area where we can do something that is humanitarian, that is decent and that will also help the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Senate to support this motion as an indication of the concern which the Senate feels and 1 ask also that action be taken in the areas I have indicated in order to assist the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and to avoid unnecessary distress to those who are already affected and to those many thousands who are bound to be affected by the results of the Government’s economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter of urgency today as I read it, has 3 elements: The promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; the relief of what  Senator Murphy  described as unnecessary distress; and a proposal for the immediate increase in the unemployment benefit and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> mean really? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think what some of us might do in this debate is to direct our attention to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PreBudget every year there is a long round of discussions with people of ability in all areas of the market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contains calculations, figures, etc., and that is the situation that you talk about when you talk about managing or promoting an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does ‘promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’ really mean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the motion proposed by  Senator Murphy  he puts forward a proposition regarding the way to promote the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be promoted by an increase in unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should talk a little about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general because that is what the matter of urgency deals with, among other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should agree, with out rancour, that this is not an easy <span class="highlight">economy</span> to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people think they know how to manage it, but it is not an easy <span class="highlight">economy</span> to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a difficult <span class="highlight">economy</span>, lt has been managed extremely well for quite a period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who undertakes the job of managing this <span class="highlight">economy</span> or who has aspirations to do so should understand that it is, as I saY, not an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is easy to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 3 basic aims which I think the <span class="highlight">economy</span> always seeks to achieve in a managerial sense: Firstly, a high level of employment within the general concept of a full employment policy, which everybody espouses and which nobody should try to inherit for himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the problem with the Austraiian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what people here might choose to say, despite what economists in the market place might say and despite what people might write to newspapers, the real test is the total world opinion of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> unci of economic management as demonstrated by the strength of the Australian currency, and by the movement of capital toward Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of that there was a definite and significant transfer to a tertiary sector in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, produced by the higher living standards and the greater opportunities which arose out of the economic growth of the earlier phases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the years a much better balance in the Australian, <span class="highlight">economy</span> has grown out of all this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is much less susceptible to the problems of the world, to the vagaries ‘of the world, to the problems of the country’s seasons and the vagaries of those seasons.- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think those who criticise, those who comment and those who make suggestions are not charged with the responsibility of managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the proposition that the promotion of ;the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by an increase in the unemployment benefit and, as  Senator Murphy  adds, some social services, is a consequential factor to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to analyse the expression ‘promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And what would additional social services and unemployment benefit do to promote the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, if it needs to be promoted, which I doubt? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, there is the issue of whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs promotion and whether this can be done appropriately by an increase in unemployment benefit, and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  have some notes on the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest that somebody who has more time later could work out what 8,000 people getting some extra income would do to an <span class="highlight">economy</span> if that <span class="highlight">economy</span> needed to be promoted, as is suggested, but which in the year of present examination is running at a figure for total Commonwealth receipts of $8,800m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 attended a 4-day seminar on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> recently and it was said by one of the people there: ‘Really and truly, if you analyse these figures you will find the unemployment problem this .vear as against last year can be the compound of the difficulties of drought in some rural areas’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says: This is unjustified and it will have no effect on the wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because, after all, there will be only 100,000 or so persons unemployed in Australia in the next couple of months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certain danger signals in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and when Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd shares drop below $10 and that giant corporation begins to curtail production, the danger bell is ringing loud and clear, even though this Government refuses to harken to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I have not the quotation, but I can assure the honourable senator that he is just not reading the Press if he believes that there are no industrialists sounding a warning about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to labour that point because any honest man in this chamber would realise that the disquite about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not confined to this side of the chamber and is not confined to financial writers but is spread right throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend its latest publication, the ‘Australian Economic Review’ of October 1971 to honourable senators who really want to know what is happening in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, instead of being lulled into the false Panglossian optimism which we have had from the Prime Minister, the Treasury and, tonight,  Senator Cotton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>drop in the absorption of new employees which is evident in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> carries with it an ominous threat of increased unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is there no clash, but an analysis on purely economic grounds suggests mat a short-fall in real government expenditure relative to the level of receipts is pushing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into recession, and so an increase in real government expenditure or a cut in taxation is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think therefore that as a matter of some great urgency the motion, would suggest in its wording, however ambiguous, that it should relate to all the factors in the postBudget <span class="highlight">economy</span> and contain some suggestions as to the factors concerned and some suggestions as to their cures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact what we have before us tonight is a statement which does not in any way attempt to define the factors operating in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, either internally or externally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a casual glance at the fact that we might consult  Mr Dunstan  of South Australia if we wanted a bag of tricks to help the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party puts forward an urgency motion which one would expect would contain some analysis of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it has only a soup kitchen answer for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and it is calamity howling at that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting for one moment that there are not elements in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which do not need attention but 1 think the calamity howlers should be put in perspective al this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ambit of the motion, of course, allows for little concentration on some of the major problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because of the broad terms in which it has been cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion refers to the promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the relief of unnecessary distress by an immediate increase in the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we attempt to say that we are competent politicians at least we ought to tackle the first part of the proposition and promote the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and therefore prevent action on the second part of it becoming necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why social services should become an urgent .natter again a couple of weeks later, and why the subject is tied to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general and to unemployment benefits, makes one wonder whether this matter has been brought before the Senate for the purpose of achieving something or for the purpose of again highlighting the divisions in the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in this place,  Senator Murphy,  when introducing his proposition, said that it was the height of folly for the Prime Minister to leave this country at this time; that he should not have left the shores of Australia but should have stayed here in Canberra and devoted all his attention to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation and thus prevented the development of the tragic events that  Senator Murphy  envisages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an analysis of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation by the Leader of the Opposition and in his criticism of the Government 1 would have expected to receive from him more worthwhile information to add to the criticisms already offered very strongly by honourable senators silting in this corner of the chamber about the management of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last few years in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least, apparently, we have unanimity of economic thinking on the part of the Democratic Labor Party and one of the hardpressed Premiers because the Victorian Premier was honest enough to say that if the Government could get the interest rate back to 5 per cent - and it was the Government which deliberately promoted its increase beyond that point - many of the problems flowing from this aspect would be solved and this would make a major contribution to the alleviation of the other problems in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one thing that economists, amateurs or professionals, politicians or others, would agree on that you cannot make two rapid changes of a major nature in any <span class="highlight">economy</span>, without suffering severe repercussions that are of no use to anybody at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that as a major measure in the balancing of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that procedure will be gradually followed until interest rates are reduced to a more reasonable figure so that they will cease to place pressure on the price levels as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 or 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is obvious that the inflation, that has bedevilled our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last 10 years has not been kind at all to the person who is genuinely unemployed for a period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy)  has brought before the Senate a matter of urgency which commences with these words: “The promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We imagine that what he means is that at the present time the <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs some fillip and he hopes that that will be provided in such a way that both business and labour forces will see a much brighter future for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> than members of the public in general are seeing at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been such that those who have been anxious to work have been able to find employment in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today and which also affect every other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is a matter for congratulation of the Australian Government or perhaps this community is very lucky, but certainly we have noi the unemployment rate that exists in any other like <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I hope that whoever happens to be in power in this country will take the opportunity to see that he makes himself well known to other countries, particularly those which have an association with our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia it is more important that we should control inflation for the benefit of the worker, for the benefit of business and for the benefit of the individual living in retirement on a fixed income while the value of our dollar decreases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter this debate because of the seriousness with which I look at the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to cure the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Government deliberately set out to create unemployment, just as it is setting out to create unemployment today, lt is not doing it on such a large scale as in 1960-61 because it was nearly defeated in the 1961 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the miserable policy of the United States, with its fictitious price of gold at SUS35 per ounce, are the mine owners to be left in the position of having to have caretakers in their mines until the American Government settles its monetary differences with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics so that any increase in the price of gold will not boost the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the USSR? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of urgency raised by  Senator Murphy  - namely, the promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the relief of unnecessary distress by an immediate increase in unemployment benefits and other social services - is one that I think we have to look at calmly, coolly and constructively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basic to the whole matter is the state of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All forms of social service provisions are related directly to the capability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to provide them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> has to have the ability to provide better conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What hurts me is this: This matter of urgency contains a suggestion that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a bad way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am endeavouring to say that Australia has an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of which we should be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confidence is vital to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and  Senator Keeffe  knows it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether he considered the cost to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this proposal and how it would be detrimental to our ability ‘o provide for those who are recipients of social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole proposition is that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is basic to our ability to do the things that we desire and that  Senator Brown  desires to do for the recients of government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole range of assistance is based on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Opposition would ruin the <span class="highlight">economy</span> with its attitudes in regard to shorter working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how genuine the Leader of the Opposition is when he suggests that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our ability to provide for our people would be affected by any increased payment to the 18,171 recipients of unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our whole attitude towards the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we have to be prepared to put value into our work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A small increase in productivity would do much more for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than can be done by a hand-out to any part of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion seeks the promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the relief of unnecessary distress by the immediate increase in unemployment benefits and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion is timely, appropriate and justified because I doubt very much whether any responsible person, even on the Government side of this chamber, would not be prepared to concede that the current state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> gives rise to grave concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many statements have been made by honourable senators on both sides of this chamber in this debate today about our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and unemployment statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore an increase in benefits would have a very small effect on overall spending in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the statements made by various speakers supporting the Government and by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  with regard to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the most recent weeks show that there is Government concern and Government action - if it is required in any way - to preserve the policy which is fundamental to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard we hope that the policies of the Government and its increasing concern for the rural sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have the effect in the near future of lessening some of these problems, and of improving the employment situation of those who have been employed by the rural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that the urgent nature of the motion which has been presented does not warrant the attitude which has been expressed by some speakers who stated that it would require a motion of this type to ensure that the Government would consider either the promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or the relief of unnecessary distress by an immediate increase in unemployment benefit and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of this Government shows that social service benefits have been increased and developed to assist in areas of social distress in Australia to the degree that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can stand such new policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the Government’s present assessment of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should any social distress be occasioned the Government will be acting to ensure that the individual Australian employee and his family will not be suffering unnecessary social distress through temporary economic difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance the Opposition has referred to the promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the relief of unnecessary distress by an immediate increase in the unemployment benefit and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each  speaker  in this debate has agreed that promotion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our unemployment figures may be small in comparison with those of other countries but I do not think that we should complacently rest on that record in the belief that we should wait until our unemployment situation reaches that of other countries before we express concern or take steps to promote the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and reduce unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time we expected a great deal from  Senator Carrick  but tonight he played the traditional role of members of the Liberal Party by claiming that everything wrong with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is caused by the workers and the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that money were to go to the impoverished wool growers who would have to spend it for their livelihood it may have the effect on the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> that everyone hopes it would have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can this help the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when the money goes into the hands of a section of the community which does not spend it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my discussions with persons involved in commerce and industry, I repeatedly emphasised the point that despite some problems, our <span class="highlight">economy</span> was fundamentally sound and that we could look to a long term annual growth rate of around 5 per cent or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our decision will be based on the interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that we have our problems - such as inflation and the state of some of the rural industries - which we must solve - but, at the same time our friends should not lose sight of the fundamental soundness of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the great promise of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister seek the support of the leaders of the Australian Labor Party in order to change this dominant attitude of trade unions which could bring economic disaster to farmers as well as to rural dwellers and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the professors believe that their plan would bring lower prices, an end to inflationary psychology, more jobs, increased demand and less capital inflow because of lower interest rates, will their proposals be studied urgently in the interests of treating our ailing <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the basic injustices that flow from the proposition that inflation and other economic evils can be controlled by fiddling - particularly upwards - the general interest rales, allegedly in the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Budget debate we contended that no case had been made out for increasing charges on not only the  community but also the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We see the various excise duties on petrol and diesel lue/ as being duties which run through the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, 1 refer to the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with resultant unemployment in certain important industries and with a number of important economists and academics drawing attention to the need for stimulation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand it has imposed these very heavy increases on the community generally - on consumers and on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is claimed, fairly accurately, that transport costs approximate 25 per cent of the whole of the costs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heavy increases in the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which already is requiring special attention by the Government, have become a fact of life, lt has been claimed that the Government is now considering to what extent special attention should be given to assisting persons engaged in the rural industries, particularly those who have been displaced from farms as a result of the downturn in sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage there is speculation as to whether corrective action is required if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not to run down to a situation in which there will be very heavy unemployment resulting in a crisis affecting all Australian consumer industries, particularly the motor vehicle industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vehicle industry in Australia - the manufacture of motor cars and trucks and the ancillary industries - is related to a very important productive system, nol only in this country but also in other countries, which can be said to have the characteristics of a highly sophisticated industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is noi whether motor vehicles should be allowed on the roads but whether the heavy transports which carry large quantities of minerals and play their part in the development of the country are an essential pan of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and should not be subject to very heavy imposts The Government should look at what charges are applied so that this important adjunct of production might not be unduly laden with costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we inhibit the transportation industry in Australia we affect not only the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and produce the sort of down-turn which I suggest we are experiencing now but also the capacity of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be evidence that sales have dropped because people are choosing, for <span class="highlight">economy</span> reasons, to buy a smaller car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we see the very heavy government imposts on an industry which has been able largely by the development of productive devices and increases in its own <span class="highlight">economy</span> to keep pace with those imposts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these imposts have to slop now because what the <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs now -is not the heavy charges that the Government has imposed but a boost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government consider the call by  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia, for an early Premiers Conference to consider ways of stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government is only placing strains on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and I put it to the Minister andto the Government that there is growing evidence from people in the community who specialise that what the <span class="highlight">economy</span> now needs is stimulation and not the heavy charges about which we are speaking tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that as a result of contributions to the debate from honourable senators on this side of the chamber the Government will consider that it is high time that the stimulationto which I have referred was engendered in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop  said that the general attitude of the Government has not been to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be stirred in any way depends on the advisers to the Government but the responsibility fianally comes right back to the relevant Minister and to the Cabinet itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had a tendency in this country for a long time, when there has been a need to put a brake onthe <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to whack on another few dollars in sales tax,to use a good old Australian phrase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  has said that he has no intention whatsoever of producing anything to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theresponsibility lies squarely on the Government’s head to ensure that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> does not remain in a depressed condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is that transport is at the root of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and petrol tax - a transport tax - is in fact a growthtax in reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we agree with many of the things that Opposition senators have said on many aspects relating to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Government’s approach to this important question, our view is that although mistakes in economic matters may be uncomfortable they certainly can be remedied, whereas mistakes in matters of defence and foreign policy involve the life or death of a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No political party in Australia has a better record than the Australian Labor Party insofar as defence and foreign policy are concerned, but to relate the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time to defence and foreign policy and other extraneous matters is, quite frankly, complete and utter balderdash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 think it is fair to observe that last week the Senate discussed for about 3 hours the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the problems which are supposed to exist therein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, it had an extremely good chance last week to express its views in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of country areas and the distances that it is necessary for students to travel in these areas for secondary and tertiary education,  Senator Bonner’s  remarks in relation to libraries will be taken on board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that at the proper time they will be given significant consideration in relation to living away from home allowances for holders of scholarships, which would be an appropriate means, if money were available, to adjust to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of those isolated areas the particular circumstances of rural children needing secondary and tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives it was the occasion for a wide ranging debate on the Budget and matters relating to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not within the duties of the  chartered  accountants who audit the accounts  to comment upon the efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the management: their business is to verify the accuracy of the accounts and to draw attention to any inaccuracies or imperfections in methods of account keeping and presentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That view may have been a little exaggerated, but since 1945 many migrants who came to this country showed sufficient enterprise and ability to establish flourishing businesses which did a great deal of good for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and provided employment for a great number of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view we should be saying to the Government that it should be doing the things which are necessary to get our <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving rather than doing’ things which will take us back to the old days of the depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the main the underspending was due to <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures introduced to comply with the Government’s policy of financial restraint applied last February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In directing a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I refer to the statement made on televisionlast night by the Prime Minister that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would not be an issue in the next Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: How much notice is the Government taking of the repeated pleas from important sections of the community about the urgent need to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Government take notice of the comments by the new  President  of ACMA,  Mr Nichols,  and act to take the brakes off the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and start the long process of restoring confidence and halting unemployment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has an obligation and a responsibility to evaluate and examine, in the light of advice available to it from other sources, the submissions put to it by any responsible group on the matter of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, lt would be quite wrong to suggest that the points of view put forward by a creditable body are not examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the simple facts of life in relation to civil aviation is this: In economic growth rate terms ‘the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> grows at about 5 per cent or 6 per cent per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister institute an inquiry into the operations of the subsidised airline operator Connair Pty Ltd of Alice Springs in order to ascertain by the thorough taking of evidence (a) what alternatives there are to the present Connair regular public transport standard operations in the Northern Territory and outback northern Australia; (b) what is the requirement of these areas, in its fullest context, for the provision of adequate air  services  having regard to (i) <span class="highlight">economy</span>, (ii) safety and speed, (iii) passenger comfort,  (iv)  proper freight handling and (v) suitable aerodromes: (c) what is the ability, nf existing or aspiring operators in these outback areas to give the standards of service, safety and maintenance to which travellers in the Northern Territory and outback Australia arc entitled: and (d) what is the feasibility and practicability of  Connair’s  F-27 aircraft proposals as a replacement fur current similar operations by major airlines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to the question I asked a few days ago concerning the matter of having Government employees travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class instead of first class, will the Minister advise when the ruling to allow first class travel was introduced by the Public Service Board, whether it applies to all Government employees, and whether the Public Service Board has in fact reviewed the ruling recently in the light of the much shorter times that are now involved in flying in Australia and the improved standard of <span class="highlight">economy</span> flying in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Public Service Board, which is the statutory body charged with administrative matters of this kind,- is undertaking an examination of the question of <span class="highlight">economy</span> class travel by Government employees, including consideration of the factors to which the honourable senator has referred, namely, the shorter times involved in flying in Australia and indeed the improved standard of <span class="highlight">economy</span> flying in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Interior,  Mr Hunt,  according to an article in the Northern Territory ‘News’, stated that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the strange thing is that the Government continues to direct attention to the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that the only cost increases in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the production of goods and services were caused by wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Labor Party and the organised union movement, as well as other people in the community, have always contended that at some stage in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> price controls must be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 800 workers have been laid off in the motor car industry throughout Australia since September because of the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Mulvihill  has said, we have reached the stage in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> where the Department of Labour and National Service ought to be geared more to the working of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing the estimates of the Department of Labour and National Service we should ask that its work be geared to provide a more specialised service in finding positions for people who are seeking work, and largely to report upon trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting back to what  Senator Mulvihill  said, it seems to me that there is a general need to give stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to watch very closely unemployment trends in the community, because these trends will cost the country a lot of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are losing about S7m in production because we are letting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> run down and this position should not obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet as soon as the trade union movement or the pensioners seek increases which will give them a just return for what they put into the community we are told by the Government - 1 remind the Minister - that the increases would wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the table shows very clearly and very starkly, in contrast with what  Senator Wriedt  had to say, that those who are producing the wealth of the country, even in this period when there are certain downturns in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are the ones who are being asked to bear the main part of the burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether we should postpone the proposed expansion for 2 years until the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country has picked up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with the adverse conditions at the present time in the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there is a requirement that this assistance continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is satisfied that the interests of this nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, growth and welfare, as well as the interests of all those persons and corporations, both within and without Australia, who are involved in the Australian securities industry require that the Commonwealth Government exercise the powers given to it at federation to legislate with respect to the securities industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An effective, expert and flexible Commonwealth regulatory body is, in the Committee’s view, necessary for the securities industry in Australia at this time, to assist it in being an efficient servant of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here one runs into the problem of trying to judge the performance of a State like Tasmania with its relatively small <span class="highlight">economy</span> together with the great disability which it has of being subject so much to sea transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We would hope that by virtue of this demonstration of attitude the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> might very quickly be restored to a position where there could be a restoration of wage and salary equity which, for the moment, apparently is being laid aside in what are considered to be the higher interests of national economic and financial stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something to which all honourable senators should dedicate their minds and to which the Government particularly should dedicate its mind so that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can very quickly be restored to a position where there can be a restoration of salar)’ and wage equity at the earliest possible moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity, following the resumption of the Parliament, to inform honourable members at first hand about the current and prospective state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and about the policy actions taken by the Government since we last met here in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I hope to provide, in particular, evidence of the strength of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its potential for continued growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of introduction to these themes, it may however be useful if I first say something about the present position and prospects of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as we see them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This assessment was the result of a very detailed and thorough examination of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we had been undertaking since about mid-January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, as at the time of the Budget we undertook to do, we have maintained a virtually continuing review of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> m recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the strains which were affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> a year or so ago have been dispelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their removal does not mean, however, that the underlying strength or growth potential of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been impaired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is important to be clear, therefore, that our review showed that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is far from being in a recessionary state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are indeed some flat spots in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, of which the most notable and important is in the area of consumer spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The external sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> remains very strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a substantial increase in the net addition to overall demand in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during 1971-72 from the excess of exports over imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The costs of finance have also been reduced in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has shown that it firmly intends that financial conditions will not be a restraining influence on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over coming months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must however emphasise that we remain as determined as ever to meet the underlying longterm needs for structural change in this sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our recent review of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> included a review of the situation in the labour market, about which so much has been said recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is undoubtedly the most difficult problem currently facing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I have said, it will be apparent that the detailed review of the  <span class="highlight">economy</span>  indicated that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was likely to continue growing steadily in the months ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In taking them we have provided a measured response to changing circumstances in a dynamic, flexible, continually moving <span class="highlight">economy</span> and one which, during the period in question, has been more than usually subject to uncertainty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will, we arc convinced, guard against any possibility that growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> might slacken over the coming months, with consequent adverse effects on the demand for labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they are, at the same time, measures which will not so propel the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we would jeopardise such hard-won success as we have so far had in reducing the inflationary pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been directed not only at the general objective of maintaining the momentum of growth but also at certain particular problems within the total framework of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over and above that, also, we have had in mind the effects the bond yield reductions would have in ensuring that financial conditions were not a restraining factor on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the ‘later months of the financial year, the period when there is normally a seasonal contraction of liquidity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, financial conditions are very conducive to increased activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, both on the consumer side and the investment side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The monetary policy measures which have been taken over recent months add up in themselves to a significant package which is having, and will continue to have important direct and indirect effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 referred earlier to the steps aimed at rectifying the strained conditions of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of 12 and 18 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as one of its aims, a more efficient and relevant system of wage determination in the context of the modern Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also been seeking, as a matter of some urgency, to find ways of strengthening competition within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to ensure that pricing decisions are made  in  a more competitive atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These, and other measures such as those directed at increasing productivity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are longer term  in  character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background, the Commonwealth believes that, in present circumstances, it has a particular obligation to ensure that wage and salary increases within the area of its own direct responsibility do not lead the way or contribute to the spreading of any new round of increases within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it does do - and it has not only a right but also, in the public interest, a duty in this connection - is to point out to the arbitral authorities the facts of the economic situation, and the consequences of their decisions for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have outlined in this statement the essential results of a recent detailed assessment of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That assessment has provided evidence of the current underlying strength of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its potential for growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is no reason for a lack of confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, 1 think, is now being recognised, and it means among other things that members of the business community can make their decisions with full confidence in the continued steady growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the legislation which we are considering nor any other Commonwealth banking legislation faces up to the question of the overriding control of the money supply of Australia, and accordingly there are large gaps in control over the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over recent years there has been a gradual metamorphosis of the financial structure of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and credit and quasi-banking institutions have taken on new forms and ever-increasing sophistication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industrial development flowing out of a pastoral <span class="highlight">economy</span> aided the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a good span of years and an important one, in the comparative sense, because the first year was the last year of what we might call a socialist type <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thelast year is the latest year of what we might call a market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have this concern because, while 1 regard a proper and sensible solution to Commonwealth-State relations as being both wise and necessary in the interests of the Australian people and all their governments, 1 believe that it is but a step on a path that must be trodden before long because if we do not resolve the management of the governmental scene between Commonwealth, State and local governments and if we do not have a wise use of Australian resources for the benefit of the Australian people - a new, independent and rising nation - we will not be dealing with the next most important problem which is this: How do we learn to manage in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is - a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree, if  Senator Cavanagh  is saying to me that boundaries are nol immutable, that there is some <span class="highlight">economy</span> of size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must have powers to maintain the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the stability of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Direct taxation in the hands of the States will not take from the Commonwealth its powers over the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real powers over the <span class="highlight">economy</span> today come from fiscal policies that are far and away greater than income taxing powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade the following matter - The determination of prices which affect the structure of costs and prices in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in particular, of prices which are determined by foreign corporations or trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, or by corporations which enjoy advantages under Commonwealth tariff, revenue, subsidy or other laws, or by corporations which have contracts wilh the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our complaint against this Government is that it has repeatedly and consistently failed to arm itself with the powers which are necessary and desirable to overcome the adverse effects of inflation and to see that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is run reasonably in the interests of the people as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has allowed itself to become a cripple because it would not assume the powers and it would not seek the legislation which would enable it to deal with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as it should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that  Senator Gair  has experience in this area, but we in the Commonwealth sphere are responsible for the general superintendence of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is suffering from this disease of price rises which in the present situation really can be made without justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been joined in some measure - not always in the same words but in words which have the same effect - by persons such as the former Attorney-General,  Mr Hughes,  who only a few days ago said that the Australian people could no longer be treated like children and that the Government was making stumbling attempts to explain the inflationary forces operating in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us know that there are  3  factors in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> like ours which have to be balanced together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of this Government is that it has done them and will do them, and will set out to do what it can to control both wisely and well this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the interests of all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> philosophy, which is the one we freely own up to, freely believe is right for this country and freely believe has made great progress for this country, has shown this: In 1947-48 the gross national product was $3,988m; last year it was $33,087m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The determination of prices which affect the structure of costs and prices in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in particular, of prices which are determined by foreign corporations or trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, or by corporations which enjoy advantages under Commonwealth tariff, revenue, subsidy or other laws, or by corporations which have contracts with the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of no problem that engages the attention of the nation more today than the question of the state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the inflationary situation in which we find ourselves and its impact on all sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 3 previous occasions when similar crises to the one that we are experiencing today occurred  -  1 refer to 1951, 1956 and 1960  -  the Government failed to take any measures which were effective in time to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What senators on this side of the chamber wish to know is what the Government pro poses to do about the other approximately 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of Australia a debate on prices or the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot be run along the lines of those absurd simplifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will stand the strain much longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the Government really know about helping to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by restraints, particularly in relation to the unjustifiable wage increases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It came down with a proposition that the ideal was to take the unions back to the arbitration system and that it would permit, on a vote of the membership of the unions which was no more ‘nan an average of 16 per cent of the membership, an amalgamation of those unions into an industrial colossus that will be the greatest threat to the stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation that we have yet faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators on the Labor side and those on the Liberal side have not enough brains to realise what this is doing to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and that they ought to be taking real precautions against it or doing something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know - those of them who are listening tonight can judge me when I next come up for election - that every wage increase they receive which is not matched by an increase in productivity takes from them the standard of living that they want to enjoy, and that every advantage they gain, in terms of increased leave, which is not matched by an expansion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and an expansion of production only makes it more difficult for the pensioners and superannuitants on their fixed incomes to survive in our community as it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we remind them that they could not achieve those exports of steel, out of which they make a lot of money, without the Australian raw materials, they very quickly begin to realise that an adverse trade balance with Australia is very necessary for their <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any increase in the price of the basic raw materials that go into a product such as a motor car or a house is as nothing compared with the increase in the ultimate price of the product which has been brought about by the inflated cost of money which has been developed quite deliberately in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the last half a dozen to 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat my hope that if the Senate adopts this proposal we will have a long overdue searching probe into the anatomy of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a suggestion that there be referred to the Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade the question of the determination of prices which affect the structure of costs and prices in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade the following matter - The determination of prices which affect the structure of costs and prices in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in particular, of prices which are determined by foreign corporations or trading or  financial  corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, or by corporations which enjoy, advantages under Commonwealth tariff, revenue, subsidy or other laws, or by corporations which have contracts with the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Murphy  pointed out, this has nothing to do with the free play of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was illustrated in another way by the Government’s attitude towards the trade practices legislation which has had abundant time to show whether it can work any effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in breaking down the practices which have the effect of prepetuating price rises and unconscionable price fixation by corporations which are powerful enough to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that, firstly, a commission of that body will shortly be visiting Australia to make an assessment of tht Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, secondly, that the OECD will be making an assessment in the near future of the New Zealand rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> and at a later date of the Australian rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>?, Does the Minister not consider that art assessment of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be made by a suitable Australian commission, as has been urged in the Parliament’ and elsewhere by the Australian Democratic Labour Party over many years and which has always been resisted by the Government and the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the recently improved wool prices and the effective operations of the Australian Wool Commission during the very depressed period of wool prices last year, which operations were of so much benefit to wool growers and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally, can the Minister say what stocks of wool are presently held by the Australian Wool Commission and what amount has been sold? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government undertake regular sur veys of the type conducted in a number of overseas countries, to determine areas of depression in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and enable measures  to  be taken  to  induce a better balance in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In assessing and applying economic policies, the Government does not rely only on overall averages, but takes account of conditions in particular regional areas as well as in broad sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and particular industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interests of stimulating confidence and buoyancy in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> are also factors which are very important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If offers nothing which would replace the stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the business world which undoubtedly will come from the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reminds me of an occasion about 10 years ago when, in similar circumstances, the Government announced that in order to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on a good business footing it was necessary to increase sales tax on motor cars by a considerable percentage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Law obviously offers plenty of people, as also does the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when we find something like 8 out of 27 are from the legal field and another 8 are from rural communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time I thought he was -trying to make a case following on what happened in England where such an allowance was needed to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot support the amendment put forward by  Senator Willesee  which suggests that the Bill should be withdrawn and that we should do nothing to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> was running into serious inflationary troubles and it seemd to me quite logical that the Government should endeavour to dampen them down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, having stopped the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from continuing on the crash course which it was following the Government is trying to reaccelerate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has to find ways of stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to me to be another way of saying: ‘Do not do anything at present; just wait and do nothing to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there is a need not only to boost the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also to increase productivity and efficiency and to be able to compete with overseas industries, heavily subsidised in many cases by their own governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the Bill is to restore the allowance which was suspended last year and to restore some confidence and remove some uncertainty .in the area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which it covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of interest to me, and I think should be of great interest to the Senate, that the references that we are considering and the reports that are before us cover a wide range of commodities that are of great importance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having drawn that part of the Tariff Board’s report to the attention of the Senate, I state that I believe not only should we be concerned with the time lag in the presentation of Tariff Board reports but also should we look at the fact that so many of these reports on references are presented together that we virtually are deprived of the opportunity for a thorough examination of the reports and the effect of the Board’s proposals on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have quoted quite extensively from the report to illustrate that the Tariff Board seems to be overburdened with references and that its full effectiveness is not being received by industry and in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the reports are out of date and do not give the up to the minute information that is needed in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> as fluid and as critical as ours is at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate in another place much stress was placed on the great importance, that the recommendations of the Tariff Board and the tariffs generally have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a tremendously important factor in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it comes back to keeping the balance between the proper claims of importers who feel that they can supply their commodities on a basis which can help the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the protection of our industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that protection has an effect on the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has an effect on our transport costs and on other costs of production.- It- has a great bearing on the stability of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These all have a great impact on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sick, and it is a deep seated sicknes which stems not just from Tariff Board reports but from the period when the Government believed that a policy of laissez-faire could succeed; that we just had to open the gates to free enterprise and prices and demand would level out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this stems from a lack of proper economic planning and a lack of sufficiently sound guidelines for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whole areas of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> affecting its very vitals, such as our means of transport and the mass media, are being allowed to come under foreign ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has created grave distortions in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and it is far beyond the capacity of the Tariff Board to adjust them and at the same time to keep the people in full employment and to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> stable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board can become one of the most important factors in stabilising and widening the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the closing comments made by  Senator O’Byrne  that tariff policy is one of the important factors in stabilising and widening the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and reports are not in the best interests of industry or of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disciplined Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Tariff Board occupies a key position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is increasingly conscious of the power, authority and role it plays in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From operating purely in relation to an individual industry and giving it protection almost ad hoc, the Tariff Board over more recent years has seen its duty as lying in a more general and wider field and in laying down the general principles in relation to the imposition and operation of tariff policy which is related to the functioning of the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> - the efficiency of Australian industry and the healthy operation of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The labour cost in Australia is high because of the nature of our national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the situation, where there is an escalation of 3 or 4 per cent on a base price of an article and where our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is inflating at that rate, one can expect that the price of materials will be increased year by year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there has been in some industries a cut back in employment which is not related to the current state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or to any taxation matters but directly to unfair competition from goods being imported from low labour cost countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This evening we have had quite an extensive debate on general matters of tariff and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which, while they have been most interesting, have had little relation to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The cost of keeping up the deterrent and general defence capacity borne by the American taxpayer and <span class="highlight">economy</span> have been and are of prodigious size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government accept that the situation so revealed reflects gross managerial incompetence to an extent which threatens the economic viability of the Line’s passenger services and does serious harm to a sensitive area of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> almost entirely dependent on shipping? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since those February decisions there have been further reviews of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> carried out in the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it fair to say that the whole tenor of public sentiment about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has undergone a very marked improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measures being proposed aim at a moderate increase in demand which we now judge to be, within the productive capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, in recognition of the special difficulty confronting minimum wage earners, the Commonwealth, while opposing any increase in the total wage, in its recent national wage submission said that it did not set its face against any increase in the minimum wage but added that any increase should not be of a magnitude which would have serious repercussions on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or which would spark off agitation for the increase in total wage rates to restore relativities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emergency assistance scheme was introduced as a shortterm measure to prevent a loss of confidence in the wool industry which would reflect throughout the whole rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that this is a takeover which involves an important part of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, lt involves a company which is in a special position under the laws of this country, lt is affected by the Airlines Agreements Act 1952, as amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But seriously problems affect the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, our transport services and the financial system of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all I want to say that it is evident to me that what is involved in the matter of industrial relations in a situation where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is rapidly expanding and where inflation has taken over and is rising very sharply every year is the ability or non-ability of trade unions to secure for their members that to which they are rightly entitled, that is, their share of the wage increases which flow from national wage cases or determinations made outside the arbitration tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the domestic side, the Tariff Board’s report will be valuable in enabling the Government to make an assessment of the scope for early action to achieve cost savings in the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> without causing injury to Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are other forces and influences outside the immediate area of where wage rates are established which bear heavily on standards of living; that is, the decisions of the Commonwealth Government in relation to the management or mismanagement of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it follows that, if the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> is mismanaged and the purchasing power of the dollar paid in wages is eroded, organised labor - be it public servants or others - has no alternative but to press claims to do nothing more than merely retain or at least restore the purchasing value of the former wage paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when the Government talks of stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, why does it have to dither on this decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his speech on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on 11th April the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  announced increases in age, invalid and widows’ pensions, long-term sickness benefits and sheltered employment allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable senators will welcome these further improvements in our social service assistance and, in recognising these proposals as benefiting not only (he direct recipients, but also the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation as a whole, will grant the Bill a speedy passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must comment that it seems remarkable that the suggestions which we put and which were unacceptable to the Government only last August, after there has been a period of restriction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which caused unemployment figures to rise and which created a sense of instability throughout the whole of industry, are suddenly acceptable and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has suddenly become flush enough for the Government to be able to afford to do the things that we suggested were within the compass of the national expenditure last August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must have been a realisation by the Government that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was not developing in the way in which it should under the restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps some of the other steps that the Government took to control inflation, such as a reduction in interest rates, may be proving more effective than trying to impoverish and draw back the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a restrictive measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said to the Government time and again - we think it has been shown by the trend that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has taken - one of the major causes of inflation was the medicine that the Government was pouring into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can never be shown that the practical effect of increasing interest rates has been to bring back under control an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is suffering from an inflationary spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in its attitude towards families, seems to be imbued with a reluctance to give due consideration to the requirements in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as ours in which prices have been spiralling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should be thoroughly alarmed at the disarray of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tasmanian shipping service will occupy the proper position that it should in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind honourable senators that, first of all, ITT attempted to prevent the election of the Allende Government - although we do not like that type of government, nevertheless it was democratically elected - and, having failed to prevent that Government’s election ITT set out then to destroy the Chilean <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a means of destroying that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does object to them I would point out they have been substantial factors for many years in the growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country, as indeed of many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known to all honourable senators that for some time the Treasury has had in hand an intensive study of the effects of foreign ownership on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This study will treat in detail the measurement of overseas ownership and the statistical information available on it; the relationship of foreign ownership to the balance of payments and through it to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; the degree of foreign ownership and control of Australian industries and resources; and the relationship between overseas investment and domestic monetary management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has particular regard to the great influence the United States of America has on the Canadian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said that the policies that have been pursued by the Government of allowing into Australia uncontrolled and untrammelled capital for the purpose of taking over Australian enterprises would damage our internal <span class="highlight">economy</span>, would militate against our overseas trading situation and could deleteriously affect, if not destroy, Australian characteristics and our very identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Committee worked full time for a whole year to demonstrate that a number of giant foreign corporations virtually dominated the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took a whole year to demonstrate that a number of giant corporations virtually dominated the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Gray report has been quoted already this afternoon, but I think it is worth putting in the record what it says regarding the Canadian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also suggests that international co-operative action between governments to control these activities and, failing that, that national measures be taken to ensure that the host <span class="highlight">economy</span> derives maximum benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also suggests as guidelines that could be useful to other national governments the introduction of a screening process via a government agency with the power to negotiate for better performance from foreign direct investors and with the power to block investment that does not make a net contribution to the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> or that does not accord with government objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been quite clearly demonstrated by the fact that the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  has instructed the Treasury to produce a White Paper on this very matter to assess the effects on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government has taken in calling for a Treasury document enunciating clearly the effects of foreign capital on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, secondly and not insignificantly, because the Senate has appointed a select committee, to inquire into all areas of concern with regard to the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will require a lot of very careful attention to define clearly the areas in which foreign investment is applied in Australia to work out the precise and significant effects that it will have on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians should have an opportunity to participate in the major growth points of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in what might be described as the ‘goodies’ which are available to capital, particularly risk capital, in a rapidly developing nation such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone say that if Australia withdraws summarily and arbitrarily by legislation the possibility of those people continuing to invest in some of those markets, that such markets will not collapse, particularly when one bears in mind the present much publicised loss of confidence in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government accept that the situation so revealed reflects managerial incompetence which threatens the economic viability of the Australian National Line’s passenger services and does serious harm to a sensitive area of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> almost entirely dependent on shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he talks of the problem of unemployment, which, as I say, was the central theme of the discussions that took place on 14th February 1972, he said in relation to being consistent with our objective of maintaining steady growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we should maintain a high level of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this statement, as always when the Prime Minister makes statements, great emphasis is placed upon the factor of wages in relation to the control of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but it is significant that the Prime Minister gives scant regard to the factors upon which wages are based, that is, the costs of goods and services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the Commonwealth controls the purse strings of the nation and, indeed, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the representatives of the Commonwealth Government here would agree that it is right that a government - in the case of Australia, one government - has to accept this responsibility, because to carve it up amongst the States of the Commonwealth diversifies the control of the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into so many hands that it is not a cohesive whole and inevitably must run into trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and exercises its capacity to influence, if not to control completely, the policy of the Reserve Bank, which enables it to control the credit resources and the lending facilities of the nation as well as the interest rates which will apply throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is possible, by the infusion of finance into the various projects carried out in Australia through the State governments, to exert pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by releasing extra spending power or, if the Commonwealth Government feels that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is getting out of hand, by decreasing spending power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all recognise that, but what puzzles me whenever Bills of this nature are before the Senate is the patronising attitude the Government adopts towards the sovereign States of the Commonwealth which have sacrificed their own taxing rights to the Commonwealth in the interests of the sane and sensible management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when the Commonwealth Government is making essential provisions to repair some of the gaps in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that have occurred through Commonwealth action, it adopts a patronising attitude towards the States as if the Commonwealth were Santa Claus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be one of the first to concede to the Federal Government that factors develop in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over which it has little or no control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can appreciate that an economic problem did develop in non-metropolitan areas in this country in the last few years when it was necessary for the Federal Government, which manages the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to take specific steps to counter a set of economic circumstances over which it had little or no control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in charge of the Bills referred also to other factors in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I maintain that if the Commonwealth is responsible for the control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation, as we have agreed, and if a set of circumstances arises where we have escalating wage costs brought about by escalating prices and escalating demand, then the Commonwealth has some direct responsibility for the economic circumstances which brings about those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot do all the things that are necessary to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is merely doing its job as the manager of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, if we accept the facts of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was adequate in the circumstances prior to 1970-71 is completely inadequate now because of the existing levels of prices and wages in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that the Commonwealth is managing in 1971-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Costs have increased and this is a result of the Commonwealth’s management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather there should be condemnation because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not managed better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we are living in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which prices have never been higher and that is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those commitments are aggravated by circumstances in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over which the Commonwealth has no control or circumstances over which the Commonwealth does have control, it is not an act of generosity by the Commonwealth to do what has to be done; it is a practical necessity for the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth fails to some extent in carrying out that responsibility of properly managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to give a stable price and wage level, it should not present itself as the giver of great gifts because it meets the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reply indicatd that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> influenced the Government’s decision in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: In view of the Prime Minister’s proposals at the moment to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will he agree to raise again the question of child care centres with the Cabinet so that the Commonwealth can play a meaningful role in the immediate provision of these essential community facilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out again that no matter what we are able to devote out of our national <span class="highlight">economy</span> to this purpose we must always keep our sense of balance and ensure that the not so obvious aspects of research and prevention are given due accord. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I think that there is a great deal of force in the reflections of the economist who recently doubted the policy of the development of a cash crop <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the way it is being done in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to attempts to equate a cash <span class="highlight">economy</span> with general community living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general belief is that they can buy goods and find out what  a  cash <span class="highlight">economy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The good work that Australia has done in Papua New Guinea for so many years, both under Liberal-Country Party governments and under Labor governments, deserves something better than that, as do the men who have served that country in its Public Service over many years and equally in the area of developing its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The note issue problems which may need to be contemplated in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as that of Papua New Guinea may well be ones on which we could continue to provide help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sure that no-one would question the importance of overseas shipping to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They realise how much danger there is to their <span class="highlight">economy</span>, so they have imposed certain restrictions on the various conferences trading to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament of the reasons for galloping inflation in Papua New Guinea, particularly in view of the fact that the Australian Government still has almost complete control over the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These issues are essentially concerned with the growth and development of the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> - for example, the allocation of available resources, the distribution of income, the degree of competition and other domestic economic management questions of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, the inflow of foreign capital also has implications for the balance of payments, but so long as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is reasonably well managed these will be less significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inflow of capital to Australia has therefore been reflected in broadly equivalent additions of real resources to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, in essence, the problem of reconciling capital inflow with sensible and balanced management of the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a purely economic viewpoint, and always assuming that the genera] management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> remains, over the years, reasonably sound, such a rise in the ownership ratio need not pose any threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the economic field, for example, consider the contention that a net inflow of capital from aboard will usually enable one’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> to grow faster, and one’s living standards to increase more rapidly, than they would otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet its force clearly diminishes, at the margin, the larger one’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the higher one’s living standards become. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, firstly, the present level of inflow and the potential problem that creates for managing the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as well as the financial costs to Australia which are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>involved; secondly, the suggestions of exchange rate speculation to which such capital inflows can give rise, and the possible consequences of that; and thirdly, the sheer fact of foreign ownership and control of important aspects of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that rate were spread over Australia, in 13 years the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and position of each town would double what it was 13 years previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those gentlemen have skilfully managed the State’s finances and its <span class="highlight">economy</span> has expanded greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been transformed from one that used to be almost entirely reliant upon primary industry to one that is very soundly based, with strong and growing mining and manufacturing industries and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the role of Government in this area has become more significant in recent years than at any time since federation- With its responsibility for the management of an increasingly sophisticated <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Government cannot leave entirely to the immediate parties to industrial relations the settlement of industrial disputes, even though its intervention may be seen on some occasions as unwelcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, however, has a total responsibility for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the danger to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the wage-induced inflation associated with industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  the Bill is an integral part of the steps this Government has taken and is continuing to take to ensure a sound and well balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments to the Act can be classified under 6 main headings: Firstly, the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, including the structure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the separation of the conciliation and arbitration functions of the Commission, and appeals and references; secondly, a strengthening of the sanctions provisions of the Act, including a review of all penalties provided by the Act; thirdly, the regulation of registered organisations established by the Act to ensure more effective democratic control of those organisations, including provisions as to secret ballots in relation to industrial bans and stoppages; fourthly, the role of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in dealing with matters of particular significance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country; fifthly, the amalgamation of organisations; and sixthly, a wide range of other provisions of the Act which are not without their own special importance to the operation of our system of conciliation and arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, I shall be referring later in this speech to the provision in the Bill which will require the Commission to pay regard to the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already emphasised the implications that decisions of the Commission can have for the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Bill proposes an amendment of section 39 of the Act to ensure that, when the Commission is constituted to deal with appeals and references and with the reserved matters under the new section 31, it shall, in considering the public interest, have regard, in particular, to the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effects on that <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any award that it might make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government has mismanaged Queensland’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its assets to the extent that Queensland now is virtually bankrupt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is not just royalty that counts but what else flows to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier in a statement gave figures to prove that the flow-on benefit from mineral operations to the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> was incontestable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 this company was expected to contribute more than $13m to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for labour and services, exclusive of moneys spent on raw materials sad supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost every day we see headlines in the Press relating to this Government’s handling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to statements such as ‘Australia’s income tax structure has become a disincentive to work’, ‘the <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs a transfusion’, the savage impact of inflation on the pensioner’, and ‘probate reform necessary’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I would like to refer to a few segments of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with the Government when it allows almost all its public servants to travel first class in aircraft at a cost of some several million dollars a year more than it would if they went <span class="highlight">economy</span> class? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pension increases are not inflationary, except to a very small degree, so it seems to me that this could be a very humane way of helping to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter related to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that will have to wait until another day for deep discussion is inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally in this section of my speech relating to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I would like to see an immediate pension increase, as already requested, and the means test removed over a period of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures would admittedly cost the Government a considerable amount but the general stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps because Tasmania has been known as the ‘Apple Isle’ for so many years, there is sometimes a danger that we will fail to recognise that this industry and its associated canning and processing companies makes up an important part of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the total <span class="highlight">economy</span> of New Zealand is so much smaller than ours, one must appreciate the enormous importance it will be to her to lose many of the European markets on which her industry has been built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think that it may be a good venture, when we are wondering what to do with our surplus stocks of dairy products, to invest some of them in, if not free distribution, almost free distribution, particularly to school children in the less well-to-do countries that may in the very near future develop an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will enable them to become customers for these products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every honourable senator knows what the lifting of the embargo on the export of iron ore has done for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the arbiter of what should be done within the community and what should be done within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every budget we have had in recent years has added increased charges to every activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the present actions by the tottering coalition Government are designed to throw on the shoulders of not only the blue collar workers but also the white collar workers in business and Commonwealth employment all the burdens which have resulted from its mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was going to declare that all the problems in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> resulted from the pressures of the wage earning section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to know what the Government is going to do about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> without imposing burdens on the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great crime of the workers is to try to achieve something like a decent wage standard  in an  expansive <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has been hamstrung by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would include not only price-incomes policy but also manpower policies, effective policies against restrictive business practices or more generally effective policies to promote competition both within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and from outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the laws that this Government is enacting, it will be found that that type of action within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will increase and the effect of the laws which have now been promoted by this Government will be, in fact, to increase the amount of militancy in the union movement, because the whole concept of conciliation is not used to the extent to which it should be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conducting a proper review it could have looked outside of this country and not thrown the burden on the workers by saying that the real threat to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is wage induced inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making provision for, or altering, rales of wages, or the manner m which rates of wages are to be ascertained, on grounds predominantly related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and without examination of any circumstance pertaining to the work upon which, or the industry in which, persons are employed; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision throws a responsibility onto the Full Bench to decide matters in respect of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators know perfectly well that the parties to the amalgamation are men who have a vested interest in the breaking down of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and that the reason they want to amalgamate is to create a bigger, stronger, more amenable organisation to put their aims into practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the outlook of all trade unions in this country was the same as the apparent outlook of trade unions in Western Germany and if the trade unions in this country were not controlled by men with a vested interest in a breakdown of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> no-one would have any worries about amalgamations or the number of trade unions we had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said it had to come and that ships had to be tied up to break the New Zealand <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as so often happens the leadership has fallen into the hands of people who are absolutely irresponsible and who have a vested interest in the destruction of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the mistaken belief, caused by a lack of knowledge of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that the primary producers’ inability to compete in overseas trade and the high cost of production is all due to the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no power over the process and the Government is and should be responsible for the proper workings of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If non-employment is dangerous to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there are more enemies in Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> sitting in this Parliament than are sitting in the Melbourne offices of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Garfield  went on to point out, however, that the lessening of competition may, in some aspects of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, be unavoidable and indeed be, not only consistent with, but also a proper ingredient of, a truly free enterprise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest menace confronting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today is inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing productivity is the most painless way for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, taken as a w’-““&gt;’” to slow inflation and this is a basic objective of these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ihese proposals would, of course, complement the other measures which the Government has taken to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of operation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these measures and proposals have as their objective the more efficient operation and more effective development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a new clause which states that in considering the public interest the question of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> must be considered by the commissioner who is presiding over a dispute before agreement rs reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proceedings before the Commission under section thirty-one, section thirty-four or section thirty-five of this Act, the Commission, shall, in considering the public interest, have regard, in particular, to the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effects on that <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any award that might be made in the proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, there could well be a conflict between the public interest and the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> because the public interest may demand an early settlement of the dispute - say, a bus dispute or a rail dispute - but under the amended Act, it cannot be settled except after a thorough investigation into the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government throws the responsibility, and the consequent antagonism of the work force, upon the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or the employer who is not permitted to pay what his industry is prepared to pay because the Commission has to take over the responsibility of government and look after the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measure which is now before the Senate has been introduced because of the attitude and actions of the unions concerned, which I can only describe as wholly unjustified, entirely unprecedented, and calculated to strike a most serious blow at the entire <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the provisions of this Bill will enshrine in the Act in legal terms the necessity for the Commission - not in every case but only in the major cases which come before it from time to time, such as those dealing with standard hours of work, the national wage and so on - to have regard for the effects on the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> of decisions which the Commission takes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 2 years, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has experienced a severe bout of wage-cost inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this year all that we have from the Government is pure politics, the separation of conciliation and arbitration, the requirement that the Commission which, under the Constitution is charged merely with the settlement of industrial disputes, should take upon itself a consideration of the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the course of its deliberations, the widening of the role of the Full Bench - let us not forget that with a Full Bench, under the Act the Commonwealth has the right to intervene - and the closer scrutiny of industrial agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The airlines have concluded that the larger Boeing 727 will best meet this need, because it offers good <span class="highlight">economy</span> of operation, is compatible with the existing fleet units, and will enable them to cope with peak traffic demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole pressure of stabilising the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not placed on the distribution area; it is placed upon the producer, the worker, whether he be a rural worker or an industrial worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That position is not only allowed to all other sellers in the Australian market <span class="highlight">economy</span>: it is the fundamental article of faith of the buyers of our labor in their capacity as sellers of goods and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rural industries, of course, comprise an important sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly as regards their contribution to our export performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, if one turns to the whole basis of industrial law one finds that this is unintelligent because whatever one’s views, whether one is a socialist or supports a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, one must realise that the purpose of industrial legislation is to secure the maximum possible peace within industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government agree that on an electoral basis 100,000 Australians unemployed roughly represents the total population of 2 electorates out of work and that much more has to be done by the Government to put confidence back into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to restore full employment to the Australian community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We followed this up with further stimulatory measures to apply more generally to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and these were announced at the Premiers’ Conference in February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that wage push has been a very important factor in inflation and I fail to see how the Government can be critical of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when the Government, in many respects, with its own servants and officers has been one of the greatest offenders in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I favour an increase in their salary, but we have been told by the Prime Minister and by other members of the Government that wage and salary increases are dangerous to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that we must exercise restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been suggested that we might give away the idea that someone should make such a sacrifice for the recovery of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> if there were other circumstances which made it essential that he be granted an increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take what is deemed to be the lowest normal living standard - I do not even use the term ‘basic wage’ because most people are on some sort of a margin - which involves people in receipt of low margins, if conciliation commissioners are to act as the instrument, and I use that word not disparagingly, of Government policy on wage fixation and have to decide the capacity of industry to pay, and the effect on the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there should be laid down certain guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will come the day, I do not doubt, when adjustments will be made according to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is absolutely essential that inflationary pressures in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> be countered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be prepared to go further than pay lip service to an attitude of opposition to the pressures within our <span class="highlight">economy</span> to which I have referred, and really to get down to tin tacks and in practical ways ensure a better balance of productivity with wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>making provision for, or altering, rates of wages, or the manner in which rates of wages are to be ascertained, on grounds predominantly related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and without examination of any circumstance pertaining to the work upon which, or the industry in which, persons are employed; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the proposed section which imposes on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it will be constituted, the obligation to consider ‘grounds predominantly related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and without examination of any circumstance pertaining to the work upon which, or the industry in which, persons are employed’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It sets the tone and the terms of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the Government ought to have the responsibility of appearing before the Commission and putting its view in regard to any effect a decision might have on the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and negating whatever the unions or the employers may say in respect of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the concept of the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or industry to pay was a concept of the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making provision for, or altering, rates of wages, or the manner in which rates of wages are to be ascertained, on grounds predominantly related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and without examination of any circumstance pertaining to the work upon which, or the industry in which, persons are employed;  1 take it from reading that that what is involved here is not a question of what is the work value in a particular industry or what loading should be given to a particular industry but that provisions for standard hours of work or standard wages, no matter what industry is involved, are not to be dealt with by a conciliation commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the question must arise as to how a conciliation commissioner decides whether the grounds are predominantly related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How would he decide whether certain grounds raised before arbitration tribunals were related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it is an industry which is related to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but it is an industry for which a minimum wage is decided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, a presidential member now has no discretion to say in relation to a strike which may be greatly damaging the <span class="highlight">economy</span>: ‘I believe that in these circumstances if I issue a certificate, far from this strike having a chance to be settled, it will aggravate the feeling between the parties and make a settlement less likely.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the information available to the Public Service Board, it would appear that more use is made of <span class="highlight">economy</span> air travel by government and parliamentary officers in the United States of America than in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is what people of Australia would expect, and it is certainly, I believe, what the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia ought to have before there is any concluded decision on the merits, or otherwise, of that agreement made between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Has the Public Service Board come to a decision concerning <span class="highlight">economy</span> air travel for Government employees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In proceedings before the Commission under section thirty-one, section thirty-four or section thirty-five of this Act, the Commission shall in considering the public interest, have regard, in particular, to the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effects on that <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any award that might be made in the proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time the Opposition expressed the view that the Government’s approach was not the right one to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on an even keel again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have  2  contenders - one the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> arm and the other the government arm - as far as possible, working in equality, seeking to serve the public and competing with each other to make sure that the service is both adequate and competent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Civil Aviation aware that many people in isolated areas of Queensland are suffering hardship because the airlines cater only for first class accommodation whereas in the more populated areas they cater for both first class and <span class="highlight">economy</span> class accommodation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, will there be some investigation into it in view of the fact that it concerns a great number of travellers who, because of the great disparity in fares, will be forced, virtually for reasons of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to undertake those journeys even though they prefer to travel in circumstances of more comfort and apparent health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is equally significant to realise that the loan approvals which have been granted have enabled projects to be financed both from ordinary and special funds for highway construction, agricultural products and processes, fishery fleet development, industrial plants, water and power supply and all that they mean to future technology, the creation of ports and airports, a great deal of irrigation and many of the essential projects which we envisage as being part of a developing <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When honourable Senators remember it is on official record that one disturbance alone has cost the government shipping line more than $2m without recourse whatever to the union as a matter of responsibility, it is time that we began to consider whether we have any right to claim to be a government and whether we will take the responsibility for ensuring that shipping services are carried on winthout interruption because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of our island State is peculiarly dependent upon those shipping services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly a Treasurer with such an unreal view of inflation is unfit to manage our complex <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s serious inflationary psychology will not disappear overnight - if at all - by waving a magic wand of false tax deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their conclusion, I am sure, will be that it is time to dismiss the stop-go Treasurer and that it is time to bring purpose and planning into the management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has claimed in the broad situation, however, that its market-<span class="highlight">economy</span> approach, and its ability to get people to respond to personal initiatives and the chance to become something more, have advanced the whole field of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and produced higher living standards and greater growth for everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The growth rate of this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> has, through a long span of years, run at a little better than 5 per cent at constant prices - I think at about 5.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The confidence which the world has in this country and in the way in which it manages its <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been demonstrated by the willingness of other people in the world to send money to Australia for investment and growth potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We did all those things to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, once the monetary conditions around the world had settled at their new levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is without doubt moving in the right direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, in the present scene where we are strong in liquid resource, strong in internal saving and strong in infusion of overseas investment money and where there is a tendency for consumer spending to be not quite what we would like and where growth rates need to be lifted, we ought to stimulate growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and that is what any responsible Treasurer would be doing at this point of time and what we are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any earnest student of this country who likes to look at the economic figures demonstrated in the Budget can see the huge expansion in economic opportunity and growth during the years that we have managed this country in the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> liberal philosophy fashion which has done a lot for this country and a lot for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it appropriates public moneys in order to maintain or expand services provided by the government, consistent with the need to accelerate or decelerate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as circumstances demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those papers have shown the intentions of Budgets to affect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in various ways from time to time in accordance with Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was a period of post-war rehabilitation during which there were acute shortages of goods in Australia, and any government that won election in  1949  was assured .of being returned because it was basking in the glory and the efficiency of a buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has accepted that glory and the praise which has followed, because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has moved satisfactorily for the entire community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result we saw increased production, and this Government had the safeguard of a buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span> which reflected our military activities overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation today is that without war ‘the .Government cannot continue in officer lt cannot continue because the buoyant /<span class="highlight">economy</span> is no longer with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a Budget designed to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and solve the unemployment position and to win an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can readily be seen, as I have pointed out, that this whole  system  by which the Government offers protection to the wealthy of Australia cannot be sustained although it occurs in time of war when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is buoyant, but I am sure that everyone hopes that the war does not come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confidence is not demonstrated even on the Government benches because of the Government’s present leadership, its muddling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the panic Budget that it has introduced on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a Budget designed to be an expansionary influence on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, many achievements of social and economic goals have been included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their reinvestment programmes demonstrate once again the great confidence which the world has, and Australians have, in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the situation is typical of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole: Inflation and increasing costs are making it impossible for many organisations to do business in Tasmania simply because of its isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the inflationary trend in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> greatly affects those on the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to isolate the Australian National Line and to say that unfortunately the increases have to occur, but there is a flow on from these increased charges right through the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless these industries have made a contribution to Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet such facilities as our shipping services are making it nearly impossible for Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> to remain viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of transport costs on the island <span class="highlight">economy</span> therefore are of fundamental importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsidies will not solve the problem but merely transfer the real cost of transport to another sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its inquiries have encompassed a wide spectrum in attempting to define what Tasmanians see as their transport disability and in assessing the significance of exports and imports to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can deny that the provisions of the Budget will provide a stimulus to the consumer section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will inject confidence into the business part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the high liquidity in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which has resulted in part from the capital inflow, there has been an increasing tendency for Australian companies to borrow overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I read the document that was presented by  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson on behalf of the Government and the sequence which it follows, I start with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade is emphasised as a vital ingredient of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that under the capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span> about which honourable senators opposite talk there should be a curb on the vast expenditure on these stupid advertisements on television which say: ‘If you do not have this variety of soap or if you do not eat these breakfast foods there is something wrong with you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be impossible to present a budget of the magnitude of this one without the background of a basically sound <span class="highlight">economy</span>, properly serviced and directed by sound governments, and good policies over the last 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve a budgetary capacity in excess of $ 10,000m from a figure of $1,1 68m some 20 years ago, in 1950-51. clearly indicates the terrific growth of our overall <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aims of the Budget, which are of great importance to every Australian, are, in the first instance, growth and development, lt is true that in recent years there has been a propensity on the part of those persons who can afford to do so to put money aside in savings bank and in the process not create local demands, which has led to a lag in the growth rate of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is not what we would like to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I have applauded before, and I applaud again, the ideal of independence and the encouragement of thrift it is also very necessary that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> be kept moving in the confident background of knowledge that we have the ability to spend money responsibly and still have savings on which to fall back if necessary or with which to buy those things that we have long term aspirations to obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will come from factors in this Budget which are not in themselves inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will lead to growth and development in what is in actual fact the biggest demand area within our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, namely, the local consumer area of goods and services and the growth and development of industry will follow from a freer spending of money by individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industry, which is the very basis of a sound <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is to be further fostered in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overriding purpose of the Budget is to boost the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back to strong but sustainable growth, which is a very responsible attitude to adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rural industry in Australia will at all times play a very important part in the overall <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good to see large increases in the export of minerals and the moneys that come through to us as a nation from those exports and it is good to see our manufacturing industries increasing their penetration of overseas markets with their products, but I feel that we have at all times to retain in our minds acceptance of the high importance of the rural basis of our whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These have been on the average well above the growth rates of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributions to promotion in overseas markets as well as the  home market in the sale of our products, and the research being applied in order to increase the efficiency of our production, represent very healthy attitudes to adopt towards our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this one area of governmental assistance in the Budget - that is, Commonwealth assistance to industry - one can read into the figures and the reasons which are given from time to time for them the fact that we have here a foundation on which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of our country may be said to be well founded with prospects of growth in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I appreciate the sincerity of  Senator Laucke,  who was the previous  speaker  in the debate, I feel that the examination spokesmen for the Government have made of the important financial document that is the 1972-73 Budget has been both superficial and inadequate to meet the needs of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, over the years, has demonstrated  a  capacity for robust growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget  will  give the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the real and psychological boost which is what it now needs to resume a strong growth path. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time that is available to me 1 will seek to show that the Budget does not concern itself with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with the problems facing the country or with the problems facing the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the crumbs which have fallen from the table - that clearly was the philosophy behind the Treasurer’s presentation of the 1972 Budget - I am sure that before this year is out the Budget will be shown to have failed in its strategy to arrest the decline in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that characterised the work of the McMahon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not want the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to be stimulated to a degree that will later cause heavy competition for labour and materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a clear possibility that excess demand helped by excess liquidity, could upset the balance of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Spiralling inflation had already caused tremendous damage to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government views with concern the considerable increase in the relative burden of personal income taxation in recent years and the effects which that is having’ upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does nothing to solve the stagnation which exists in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  gave us a great example today of the expansion of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> when he pointed out that tax revenues would rise despite the fact that the Gov ernment has reduced the personal income tax rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After listening to the speech which was made a short time ago by  Senator Gietzelt  one wonders whether, if he were a migrant coming to this country, he would ever settle here- considering the great woe that he wailed around the chamber about this great Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is every chance that it will induce a spark of liveliness from the most wretched prongs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> - public spending and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the most  uncynical  supporter must detect the sweat of panic behind last night’s gift to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why else should the Government blandly assure the nation for 7 months that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sound and then, without warning, suddenly rewrite the whole Budget strategy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This slackness in consumer spending has been basic to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s lack of punch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, 1 rather resent - I use the word resent’ because J do not think that I could rind a word more appropriate to express my feelings - the continuous attack by the Government on the trade union movement for what the Government alleges is the sabotage of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This slackness in consumer spending has been basic to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s lack of punch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘Philosophy and Objectives’ the Treasurer said something which many of us on this side of the chamber have been urging for some time, that is that the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be assisted because no wealth is produced by the public sector; it is produced by the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is central to our objectives that the needed stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should not be by way of an excessive growth of Commonwealth expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its aim is to expand consumer spending, to overcome the sluggishness in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to give further assistance to the private sector, from which all wealth grows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that a false <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not lead to people prejudicing themselves or those dependent upon them by believing that they are able to achieve the results they want by using one of these kits instead of going to legal practitioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the great question posed by the Budget is whether people will accept the increased purchasing power and will spend to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving and not continue to save. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every hand, whether in reference to inflation, spiralling prices, unemployment or any other ill from which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is suffering, we hear the cry from the Government, in a monotonous repetition, that these things have been caused by the wicked trade unions through their persuasion for increased wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has failed to plan; it has failed to communicate with either the Parliament or the electorate; it has failed to restore confidence in the community; it has failed to restore confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unemployment position exists as a result of lack of planning by the Government and failure to correct the ills that plague the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of very great significance and most important that we make known that the effect of revaluation will be felt not only in the primary industry sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years that have preceded this election the Government has generally put the brakes on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators must remember that the Federal Government has complete control over the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia and that whatever targets it sets for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are the targets which State governments have to match; that is its role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one challenges the Government it will deny that it is its responsibility to ensure that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will work and that there is a satisfactory decrease in unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It placed sales tax and other heavy increases on the community because it claimed that there was a need to depress the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to reduce consumer spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party says that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> ought to be geared to make sure that there is proper economic growth each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past a number of Liberal governments have decided in a haphazard way how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it believes in the sorts of things it is putting up at this election such as social welfare, the need to control overseas investment and the need to plan the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, why has it not done these things during those 23 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have tried to point out to the Senate is that the Commonwealth Government, being the arbiter on how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should work, has responsibility for the manner in which the States operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States are able to gear their industries to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the necessary consumer demand will eventuate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Government of Western Australia found it possible to gear <span class="highlight">economy</span> to what it desired, the problems caused by the decline in the mineral industry, for instance, which was no fault of the Labor Government, could be adjusted by some other type of work being undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not contested today because, as we know petitions are presented to the Parliament day after day showing that each State Government, be it Labor or Liberal faces great problems in running its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the problems on which I would like to touch relates to a question I asked about 2 weeks ago regarding the provision of <span class="highlight">economy</span> class air travel for people in outback areas of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On flights between more populated areas such as Brisbane and Rockhampton or similar cities, passengers have the choice of either first class or <span class="highlight">economy</span> class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the worst features of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present is that 25 per cent of the work force is employed in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it also believes that in moving towards them the gains made must be genuine and can be supported by the resources of the country without undue strain on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A whole complex of factors has dictated the level of the standard working week over the years but today the over-riding consideration has to be the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to bear the cost - in truth, the capacity of the citizen himself to bear the cost of new concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot stand aside idly while such a build-up is taking place, especially when new pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> have to be avoided, and when there is abundant evidence from recent polls that a majority, a sizeable majority of Australians, is opposed to a 35-hour week at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could bear at this stage as it is emerging from a sluggish period with inflationary pressures still at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ramifications of such a huge increase in the national wage bill would be felt right through the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleagues directly concerned with various aspects of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have more to say about all these problems later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everything the Government has done has been directed to keeping the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on an even kee! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Immigration has helped to provide both impetus and means for the continued sound growth of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the face of widely varying and often adverse events in the world markets so important to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it has enabled migrants to make an immediate and positive contribution to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many other areas of need which have been given generous attention in the Budget that will both stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, inculcate confidence and reduce disparities and differences in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, he said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless we have a secure <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a secure country in the world situation we cannot progress with anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In planning the nation’s Budget the Government inevitably is concerned with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation and its growth rate, but costs, prices, incomes, expenditures, exports and imports and all such matters must be taken into account, as must the outlays of both the private sector and the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That indicates that there will be immediate and considerable relief to persons who previously were disadvantaged because the depreciating effect of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> changed fixed incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator, because of this coalition support of the Liberal Party, has been responsible for allowing savage margins of profit to be earned on the production of goods in the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he also able to say whether the composition of the Canadian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and problems asssociated with it, can be compared to the position in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister in charge of this matter in the Senate 1 look forward with anticipation to the Committee’s recommendations as a stimulus to the appropriate means by which this important problem will receive resolution, particularly in a period when the outback <span class="highlight">economy</span> is greatly depressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has brought in programmes to counteract these industry-wide difficulties including improvement in the supply of credit to the vital rural sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For me, as a senator, that first prospect is serious enough because of the effect it will have on this industry and on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it is a great contributor to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From what I have said honourable senators will be able to see what effect this situation could have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are asking for, if accepted, will help stabilise the industry and will build up confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If something can be done along the lines sought by the representatives of industry the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be stimulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tax reductions wherever practicable, consistent with the essential needs of defence, social and public services and of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to preserve equity as between taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government really wanted to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving the reverse should have happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some argument has arisen in relation to the circumstances which have pervaded the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the past years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our kind of society every reasonable young person should have an opportunity to save money and to provide himself with a home and with some of the things which are necessities in our type of <span class="highlight">economy</span> but which in many countries of the world are considered to be luxuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the elderly people who helped to construct the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and society that we have inherited today should be provided with social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decisions affecting much activity in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is entrusted to expert tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great wage tribunals of this country when allowed to operate untrammelled take into consideration all factors that are necessary for the well-being of the whole community and when they come to fix wages they do not decide that someone should have a certain increase simply because he needs it or for some similar reason; they decide whether industry can afford to pay and whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can stand the increase which is proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are only at the beginning of this enormous Australian industry which will transform the fuel aspect of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the high level of capital inflow and the potential problem that creates for managing the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>; the suggestions of exchange rate speculation to which such inflows give rise, and the possible consequences of that; and the sheer growth of foreign ownership and control of important elements of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the overseas capital was being used to add to the resources available in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, in the past 2 years, capital inflow has resulted chiefly in a build-up of international reserves rather than an addition to resources actually being used in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the stated objective of the Budget was to create an expansionary situation for consumer spending, it is noteworthy that these reductions in personal income tax will release some personal spending capacity into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this present reduction in rates will be an immediate benefit to the spending in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that it will point also to the need for the major restructure which we hope will take effect in the not too distant future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister would take the stance that the more we reduce our imports of timber the better it will be for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who is conscious of the facts knows that the slight recession last year in the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> tightened up iron ore exports and tightened up the wool market, and that it was a pretty potent factor in creating the cold breeze that hit Australia and made the employment situation less buoyant than it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot maintain this <span class="highlight">economy</span> unless we maintain successful trading units within it which can employ people throughout the whole range of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have made a study of the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> and Japan’s situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as she is able to get iron ore from Australia so that she can build the huge tankers of 100,000 tons which she sells to Greek shipping merchants and others in order to boost her <span class="highlight">economy</span> she will not refuse to buy that iron ore merely because Australia has an unfavourable trading balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Gas Light Co. in Sydney, of its own volition, has worked out what is best for it and, via it, for the New South Wales <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, we promote secondary industry in Australia through the growth of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> arising from trade with Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the process they develop our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and provide through their activities employment and tax revenue and promote further industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the basis of a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span> without which I cannot see how we would advance as a nation in the way that we have in recent times and as we will in the future, I am quite certain, if we are prepared not to intrude unduly into the general running of industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any government worth its salt, any government concerned with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with employment or with industry would have had its officers working to establish the requirements associated with this new industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must start to plan the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Their members are finding themselves having to cope with a cash <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to become accustomed to a radically changed diet and to learn aspects of hygiene not previously relevant in their nomadic exsistence I think we should all try to realise that these Aborigines living in remote situations are experiencing a difficult period of rapid change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An assessment of the position of the industry in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the State of Tasmania is a matter for the State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, an overall plan for the planting of softwoods is essential for the balance of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly our paper industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dealing with the subject that is contained in the amendment, we feel that the whole matter of land settlement and primary industry in this country is something that must fit into the general pattern of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there should be a place for war service land settlement that has served this nation and its citizens very well in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies particularly in the area of primary industry where the farmer battles with the elements as well as with the ordinary circumstances of business and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a result of the attitude of the present Government and its laissez-faire approach to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would have to be looked at fairly critically, particularly since that while we all recognise that it is desirable to secure overseas markets for primary products, the basis from which a start should be made in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> is that the establishments themselves have an obligation to look to their own capital resources and to do their own development in order to attract trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in August the average weekly <span class="highlight">economy</span> passenger loading reached a record high of almost 80 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This compares with a yearly average for <span class="highlight">economy</span> passengers of about 53 per cent on that route for the 1971-72 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding to explain the nature of the changes the Bill proposes I take the opportunity to recapitulate the Government’s philosophy in regard to restrictive trade practices and monopolies, bearing as they do on the competitive climate of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, it recognises that the lessening of competition may, in some aspects of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, be unavoidable and indeed be, not only consistent with but also a proper ingredient of, a truly free enterprise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also recognises that the nature of the legislative provisions to control restrictive trade practices in Australia must be attuned to the requirements of the size and character of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that these are the agreements which tend to have the greatest impact on the competitive climate of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the Government has concluded that many of such agreements are likely to be found on examination to be contrary to the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned in the early part of my speech, the Australian wool industry is of vital importance to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were so many conflicting statements that it seems obvious that there must be some inquiry in Australia of a national and responsible character to find out, firstly, what the situation is, and secondly, its consequences on the Australian work force and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not advocating that course; 1 am merely pointing out that if a proper inquiry reveals that there is the genuine unemployment that some figures seem to indicate, there arc now many ways and means available to the Government which it has not had in some circumstances in the past when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country was unable to sustain employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to periods such as in the 1930s when very few people had one full time job, let alone the opportunity to enjoy a situation in which, if they wished, they could be dually employed, as is now possible and as is happening in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as people interested in the whole of Australia and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and indeed as people genuinely interested in the employment of every Australian in a proper and reasonable type of job, would maintain that the interests of everybody should be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We merely point out at this point of time, without expressing any opinion at all, that the evidence should be collated and that it should be considered in making a decision on a national level, first of all, as to whether there should be any alleviation of the customs duty normally paid in this area and, secondly, as to whether there should be governmental action to see that any contracts of this character have some Australian content included in them in the interests of the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation, except for the pressing needs of inflation, is still buoyant and is still maintaining a level of employment, and because the general level of prosperity of the whole community is probably equal to, if not better than that existing in almost any other country, everything is all right and we have no more need to plan, to take precautions, to worry or to doubt that in the next 5 to 1.0 years of challenge we will be just as successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we will be but only if we do things and take actions that are suggested by the circumstances and are designed to improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and make it more capable of passing through the transitory period through which it must inevitably pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As politicians in the nation, of course, we have a great responsibility to the people if we expect to lead them in our various parlies with our various ideas in these areas of international trade and the preservation and the establishment of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> capable of withstanding the complete change that we will have to accept in the next 5 to 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will only curtail, as I heard the Minister mention today in answer to a question, the flow of the S45m that can be poured into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the actual laying of the pipeline and the enormous savings to the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the reduction of costs that could result to industry in New South Wales, particularly in the Sydney area, by the introduction of a new and cheaper form of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the first stage of what everybody must concede will be the establishment of a national development of great significance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia and te the Government’s more recent involvement in the affairs of decentralisation and urban matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, if it is a matter of re-tooling by our major steel companies and their subsidiaries, the sooner that re-tooling takes place and we are able to realise the potential of this industry the better it will be for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot afford to spend this sort of money without having regard to !he beneficial effects it could have on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> if in fact there was a national plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>One does not have to go far back into history to appreciate that the development of the railway industry played a very big part in the stimulation and development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the 19th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We wil) take into consideration the matters of the environment, decentralisation, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Senate Standing Committee would not deal with a question which is of great concern to Australians now, that is, the growing ownership by foreign operators in all sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone who has amassed a fortune by exploiting our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, our land or perhaps other human beings has a responsibility to pay back to the nation a portion of what he has amassed over the period and not deprive those who have not had an opportunity to pay probate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was at a time of extreme rural hardship, of depressed prices and of a poor <span class="highlight">economy</span> but of uncontrolled inflation - all the direct responsibility of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With your indulgence,  Mr President,  and with the indulgence of the Senate, it would be best, I think, to repeat what the Prime Minister said because I believe he expressed the current position with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a much higher growth rate than the average growth rate of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country grows at about 4.2 per cent to 4.5 per cent per annum, in constant price terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This is equivalent to 93 per cent of the SydneyNew York <span class="highlight">economy</span> class fare and 85 per cent of the Sydney-London <span class="highlight">economy</span> class fare one way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should examine the relationship of Qantas to the overall Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the importance of overseas earnings balanced against airline profits and in the light of this examination, redraft the financial directives under which  Qantas  operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both Bills are concerned with the problems that arise when, in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, competition is restricted or is absent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The approach to be taken to monopoly situations depends very much on the character of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> involved and, in paticular, on the size of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great complaints against the Government is the lack of planning and the lack of action by the Government in the field of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More and more the statements being made by leading industrialists are critical of the Government’s failure to take action to plan in this <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to take action to introduce elementary law and order into the economic affairs of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill could affect the whole structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those in the community concerned with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have an opportunity to examine this proposal and will be in a position to put to the government, whichever party is in power, its views on the proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a very courageous act to let the world know what the implications are for Australia and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia in 1973 and the years to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that far from the Budget being bribery of the electors, as  Senator Poyser  described it, though I appreciate he used that description in the broad political sense, the whole basis of the Budget was to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of the Government’s consideration was to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and I think that one of the most effective ways by which the Budget has been able to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in the taxation field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had international monetary problems to deal with and as a consequence of those international economic problems with which we were confronted there was some slack in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which it was necessary to deal with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think even our worst enemy would deny that as a result of the budgetary measures that have been put down there has been a significant movement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a stimulation and greater confidence and greater security in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The big reward is to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia and in the fact that we will have a happier, better and more economically sound Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say in conclusion is that this Budget has been pitched to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to be a characteristic of our primary industries - perhaps not an unhealthy one - that one receives representations from people with many different points of vie;w. At times even the various associations have great difficulty in reaching unanimity in relation to the things which they desire the Parliament to do in the interests of the industry which in turn contributes so much to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the thing, very often they have not been able to do so in the past because they could not afford it, despite all the love and affection they have for their loved ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these circumstances it is the practice to charge Press representatives the equivalent of commercial <span class="highlight">economy</span> fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that a final solution to this could cause great disturbances to the Australian community, because if we are going to project proper policies of decentralisation and for the sustenance of people and of commerce in rural areas and sustain the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the rural and more remote areas of the Commonwealth, then we have to interfere and have to rationalise the various rural industries and the lives of those associated with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the absence of a master plan is one of the problems that face the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the whole of the non-urban areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only does this place a great burden on Tasmanian industries and the Tasmanian people but it also points up very strongly that the contribution of Tasmania to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> is less than it might be, given more favourable circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any event, this is an argument which has not carried any weight in the spheres mentioned by  Senator Bishop  where agreements have already been negotiated and are in fact operating, that is, in the building industry and the metal trades industries, which are major segments of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He mentioned, and I do not mean this in any discourteous way at all, almost every problem that we as a nation have had and are having in relation to the great question - one of the most fundamental questions of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> - of overseas investment and capital inflow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of passengers embarked in 1969 increased by 12 per cent over the previous year and by the same amount the following year, but slipped to half that rate in 1971, mainly due to the recession in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> brought about by this Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that this is a reflection of the general improvement in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> following the improvement in the rural situation and the Budget which was introduced recently and which 1 think has done much for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report will be valuable also in enabling the Government to assess the scope for action to achieve cost savings in the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>, without causing injury to Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: In order to assess the effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the recent devaluation of the United States dollar, will the Minister advise the proportion of export income received for the year ended 30th June 1972 which resulted from contracts written hi United States dollars? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the justification for displacing the old criteria of proper <span class="highlight">economy</span> in contract”; and proper performance of contracts by the criterion adopted by him of good relations with unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, when it was in government, had recognised the flow-on potential of a government decision in this area and had doubted the ability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in times of increasing cost pressures, to sustain an increase of that magnitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that it creates a burden on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the power of the Government to give effect to that promise is unquestioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not know whether this principle will flow to other industries and we do not know whether it will aggravate inflation to the extent that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot stand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it true, as Press reports claim, that the Department of the Treasury has presented to the Cabinet a submission which claims that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is approaching boom conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that those principles include incidentally, encouragement of industrial organisations of employers and employees; that membership is not to be compulsory, and acceptance of the principle that in return for good work employed persons merit the highest wages and best conditions that the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> can sustain with regard to the situation in any particular industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope, and I am sure all honourable senators on this side of the chamber hope, that the Government will realise that some of the matters on which it has embarked already will have a disastrous effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> unless they can be curbed and unless they can be related further to sound development and the curtailment of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam made it clear that the proposal was related to the economic conditions at the time and designed to provide an immediate stimulus for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, clearly required at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at it quite objectively one finds it extremely hard to raise any argument against the general merits of the Bill, believing as one does that the banking sector and its savings bank counterpart are very appropriately handled in the Australian context in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> style where there is a series of private banking institutions together with savings bank agencies and a Commonwealth Bank with its own savings bank agency competing for business, deposits and advances in the open market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It puts the Commonwealth Savings Bank as a part of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation in the same situation as the banks in the private enterprise sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The origination of finance for housing would appear to me to be one of the most important factors in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it should be done in Australia to encourage further an interest in home ownership and certainly to encourage an interest in further building development which, as I have said, is one of the major keys to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the actions of Government in the public sector inevitably and inexorably affect the actions of the private sector - far more than the reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A committee which seeks to examine price links and price levels in the private sector without having regard to the inflationary impact on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the public sector would not have the capacity to’ examine the overall nature of the Australian inflationary experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>; private industry plays its part, and very effectively, and Government plays its part, and very effectively too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They run together, and to succeed in this country economically they have to run together in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a proposition would have no regard to the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of increasing wages without a consequent increase in productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it could be said that under paragraph (c) it would be possible to refer to the proposed committee of inquiry the question of the effect of wage increases and a reduction in the working week on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can never find out how it affects the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, except as is reflected in the inflationary spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pernicious because it will eventually destroy the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> if allowed to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now a new Government has determined that it will face up to the issues that are dogging the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to tackle and grapple with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that it will not be a simple proposition in a capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span> containing so many self seekers and people dominated by greed for high profits and the power that comes from being in the top echelon of business administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will want the continuation of this type of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will go over the whole field of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> because, as I said, to come to grips with this problem we have to come to grips with pernicious and insidious influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain that if the employees of this country knew that we were coming to grips with prices and that there was a possibility of stabilising the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there would be a tremendous desire on their part to co-operate with the employer to see whether we could not get Australia on a more sound economic footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear also that every step has been taken by the present Administration to set the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order, and it is being successful in that endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At all times, he will co-operate, as will the rest of the Government, with the States and with other interested bodies to see to it that there is a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span> in combating the problems of inflation, some of which, of course, are international problems and incapable of being solved inside any one country as everyone has come to realise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out the provision of employment and the radiation from this industry generally to other industry in Australia is of real importance to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During a period in which there may have been some problems within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country generally wine sales did not escalate but held their existing level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the snowballing effect, or the flow on as it is called, of this Bill on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally will be of very great proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think what the honourable senator says is well known, namely, that in the general sense of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and profitability most industries are doing fairly well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly, of course, to secondary industry and other areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a state of prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some incidental stresses are occurring at present, but they are not symptomatic of the state of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of any snowballing effect of the granting of extra annual leave applies also to any other movement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So looking at it from the point of view of those who are borrowing the money, it is a good arrangement so long as their <span class="highlight">economy</span> can stand the repayment program, and the Bank, no doubt, would have assured itself of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though we will seek to make our <span class="highlight">economy</span> increasingly self supporting and viable, and though we may seek assistance from other countries, we will look to Australia to continue aid to us and assist in our defence for some time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of Government spending on inflation and on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally are given careful consideration by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people do not know now I believe they will know shortly that our internal <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as has been exhibited by our attitude externally and in our foreign relations, is being guided by this Labor Party in government which in turn is being guided by a very very strong left wing influence which I would brand as a communist influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is subrevise and I think we will see our <span class="highlight">economy</span> decline within a short period as a result of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of reference of the Committee were restricted to exploring ways of providing guidance to small business management to help in improving efficiency, rather than in undertaking a comprehensive investigation of the role of small business in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of the problems faced by small business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that small business has and ought to have a vital role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is considerable scope for active government initiative in strengthening not only the competitiveness but also the contribution that small business makes to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This initiative is all the more important in view of the disturbingly high level of the concentration of ownership within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and particularly the level of foreign ownership which has been encouraged to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises the importance of small business in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an independent and growing <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and we are jealous of our national sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not think it should become so over-enthusiastic in doing some of the things that it is doing that it neglects the areas of management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will make these steps possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The incoming Government found itself in possession of sufficient finance and a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> which enabled it to move forward into the sphere of extending services on the wide and sweeping scale that it has announced it proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A situation of great importance is showing up within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the gravamen of his speech, as I understood it, was his concern about the inflationary effects that this legislation might have on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to know that  Senator Rae  certainly is not concerned that this Bill will have any inflationary effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer himself is taking wise and prudent steps in the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to curb the effects of inflation, and the Government is showing its concern in every way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor of the Reserve Bank, in announcing the increase in the Statutory Reserve Deposit ratio, emphasised that it was intended that the banking system should play its part in the provision of finance adequate to permit soundly-based expansion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s stated interest in tourism and its policy to revamp this sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, when does his colleague intend to visit South Australia to examine the needs of the tourist industry and the potential of the industry in the Flinders Ranges and other areas in South Australia, such as the Barossa Valley, Eyre Peninsula and the Riverland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that when we talk of the lowest practicable rates we must consider this in the context of interest rates generally in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s intention to do as the Prime Minister said, namely, to provide long term loans at the lowest possible interest rate consistent with the average rates that apply in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at any particular time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in his policy speech, said that the strength of multi-national corporations in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> requires strong unions as well as strong government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will be aware of the new policies of the domestic airlines in introducing <span class="highlight">economy</span> fares, and the existence of the curfew on aircraft operations at Brisbane airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we really deserve as a Party is to have at least 20 years in government to make up for the 23 years during which the LiberalCountry Party Government made a shocking mess of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 arguments put forward by the Country Party to justify what one might call over-representation of rural areas were, firstly, that an area manageable in terms of transport and communication by the local member is essential and, secondly, that rural economic interests, particularly exports, are so important to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> that they must  have adequate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it (the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange) is doing a job which no one has ever tried before, which even a Royal Commission could not match in terms of speed, power, <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and the use of expertise, yet which can only be regarded as highly desirable in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, as an advanced <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a region comprising mostly developing countries, the Government firmly believes that Australia should be in the vanguard of countries taking action to foster and develop sound labour and social policies in accordance with accepted international standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the matter to which 1 wish to refer specifically this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot have a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> unless productivity matches costs as far as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continued growth of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is vital to our well being and we must not be insular in our attitudes towards investment from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hie protectionist advocates in America could well win their objective of putting a wall around our <span class="highlight">economy</span> if our trade partners drastically restricted the flow of our exports or completely cut off our participation in their economies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and  then  deny access to us of that which has been of such real benefit to the growth of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in recent decades, we will be heading into a situation where, as wealthy as we may feel that we are as a nation, we will not be able to sustain the growth and the living standards which has marked our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and society in recent decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Consideration has to be given in the first place to the things which generate heat in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and which lead to inflation to the degree which unfortunately we are now experiencing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we are looking at somewhat reduced numbers to meet the economic situation of li to 2 years ago, but unless we have an active immigration policy which brings us skills and assistance in the labour field we will not have the generation within our own <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the local scene that we need to have to continue the growth that has marked our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last couple of decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>could regard the Australian capital situation today as being of such magnitude, due to the wise and efficient operations of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the previous Government, that the Government could permit a capital loan to be made to the Government of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence available to the institute shows unquestionably that inflation in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been brought about by cost pressures rather than by excessive demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government also has ignored the fact that under the previous Government, in its 22 years of management in what I call a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> style as contrasted to this Government’s style, the average level of Australian wages had reached number 3 in the world on real comparison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We of the Opposition also believe that the Government has ignored totally the inflationary role in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from such matters as Public Service salaries and hours about which the Government has been very ad lib - it really has been most liberal; anybody who asked could have - and the effects that such considerations given to the Public Service have on the total <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Government has ignored its own role as well in the direct promotion of price increases due to various forms of indirect taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The apparent inflation rate in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today would be about 8 per cent to 9 per cent, but 1 believe that by the end of this calendar year we will see a higher rate than that because of what I call the over-run of the Government’s decisions and the overrun between wage increases and productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should also consider seriously the fact that it is involved in a. mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that it cannot do things’ without regard to the whole, impact that its actions .will have on the economic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are to be attacked to further the case of a socialist ideal which is quite unreal in the management of a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which due regard should be paid to al] the pressures and influences that should operate in such a management scene and in such an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of private investment despite a rapidly inflating <span class="highlight">economy</span> is, I believe, a reflection of the concern felt by many business people that the Importance, of the basic consideration’s is not fully understood and accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore speak as someone who would share the feeling that inflation is of major importance in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that there needs to be a community attitude about it to assist the Government in policies which may need to be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we cannot accept a situation which is a potential economic sink’, he said, ‘a sink where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the whole State for many, years is in jeopardy if we have to keep putting Federal and State money into it because it is not a viable proposition’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is I think agreed on all sides that, whatever other steps may be necessary to check inflation, all are likely to prove futile unless fiscal and monetary policies in the broad are sensibly and responsibly geared to the productive capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There used to be a stage in the Australian situation at which the rate of pay for a comparable job in what I call the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> - the open system, as distinct from Government employment - was a little higher than that offering in the Public Service for the same talent, the same ability and the same responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say this because this mushroom growth in expenditure by the public sector will place very heavy pressure upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will add very severely to the inflationary tendencies which are ‘now themselves of serious consequence and will increase and, therefore, will hurt the little people who are not subject to what has been defined as Cough’s Law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The intrusion of the Commonwealth originally in 1945, and sustained through succeeding years because of the essential problems which were created by a wartime <span class="highlight">economy</span>, developed because the Commonwealth always has had the funds and the States comparably, have lacked the funds to provide the type of housing which they wished to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that the Labor Party and its Leader went to the people and said to them: ‘We will give you a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a major matter of complaint which could be directed to this Government, it is the complaint that the Government has taken over an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was in ship-shape condition and is letting it run down in such a way that there is apprehension in every quarter of the community as to what the future holds for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the airlines have recently been allowed a 10 per cent fare increase, and that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would suggest that fares will continue to increase over the coming years, and as Tasmania is so dependent upon air travel, will the Minister attempt to find some way of ensuring that tourists to and from Tasmania will be given a preferential rate of air travel, subsidised in some way, in lieu of spending money in other States for the development of freeways for interstate transport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this may appear on the surface to have exactly the kind of effect which the honourable senator suggests, it is part of the mechanism for controlling the monetary flow and the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as to the overall proposition, of course the Government stands for aiming at the lowest possible interest rates for housing and it would not be taking any steps which would have any other result unless it thought it was absolutely necessary in the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The move into the European <span class="highlight">economy</span>, although disputed by some sides, is supported by others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that by practically any test we care to make the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today is thriving and the immediate future looks good’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could we be advised, if it is true that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is thriving and the future looks good, why the Treasury has just issued a statement warning in very serious terms of the dangers in the present economic situation and why the Government has started to implement a credit squeeze? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems pretty clear to everyone that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is booming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> looks as if it is becoming too good and becoming overheated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">economy</span> starts to reach this position of boom the Treasurer, as Treasurers whether in this country or any other country always do, seeks to curb the undesirable effects which might come by endeavouring to caution the community against the overheating of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and indulges in various measures to try to prevent that occurring so that the good times we are experiencing will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the wise guidance of the Treasurer we can all look forward to an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is prosperous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather we wish to have a reasonably regulated <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will be one of prosperity for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that if these South Australian industries are adversely affected by the establishment of more overseas car plants in Australia it could create large unemployment and greatly affect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is extremely important that whatever is done in the motor car industry fits into the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> and has proper regard to those engaged in the industry in South Australia and to the welfare of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in my view, is not a particularly easy one to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it will be found that on various occasions in the past when in Opposition honourable senators opposite have said that it was not hard to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a matter of delicate balance and it calls for fine and early adjustment when things are beginning to move the wrong way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Cotton has said a few useful things about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the changes which are taking place in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a basically strong situation with our mineral wealth, our capacity on the farms and in industry, yet the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was being dealt with so unwisely towards the end of the previous Government’s period of office that there was high unemployment, an excessive slowing down of economic activity and, of course, a loss of price stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing Government, having inherited this unhealthy situation, has transformed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that we have what may fairly be described as full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report went into great detailthis is found on page 158 and elsewhere- as to the ineffectiveness of selecting interest alone, because if there is an inflation <span class="highlight">economy</span> and persons need the money they will be prepard to pay the extra interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the tragedies is that so many of our financial institutions seem to be outside the clear powers of the Commonwealthsuch as the fringe banking institutionsthat monetary measures are not able to be taken as well as they ought to be in a properly regulated <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the reasons why, central to the considerations of the Constitutional Review Committee last week was the problem of enabling the national Parliament and Government to have adequate powers to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be part of the means of mopping up what is deemed to be the excessive liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The OECD report on his own Government, to which he has referred, states that price stability had been lost under the previous Government, that there was excessive slowness in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that economic activity had declined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exchange rate which is established for the Australian dollar against the currencies of other countries is of very far reaching importance to every sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest argument that I can recall over that period was that the government of that time attempted to dampen down the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that the inflationary trend did not run further ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that of itself is adding to the inflationary pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least I would know that he had gained some experience of the business qualifications which are necessary to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December the Labor Party, with full knowledge of all the factors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> said: ‘Put us in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mystery is how the Government proposes, by increasing interest rates, to assist the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sees in them serious damage to the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the people of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the Government explain to the people of Australia how robbing them of the money in their savings bank account, how robbing the pensioners who under the Labour Government cannot hope ever to keep pace with inflation, how reducing the purchasing power of the pensioner and how weakening the Western Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and weakening manufacturers will be good for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are making a very strong attempt to adjust the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O  ‘Byrne said that he hoped that we do not import too much of the inflation from other countries into our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found it somewhat conflicting to read that the Government seeks to increase imports into Australia at present, with the hope that it will reduce the effect of inflation on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that this policy would have been a very difficult one for the Government to accept as it has stated, and we would have felt, it had a sense of responsibility to provide the Australian community with lower cost housing or at least housing which can be achieved within the context of the present <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increase in interest rates will also have the effect of diminishing the opportunity for growth in the private sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the number of ways that this Government feels that it can diminish the private sector and expand the public sector without somewhat disastrous effects on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general, but it seems to me that the program of social concern, educational opportunities and all those things which we wish to do for the Australian people can come only from a confident and efficient private sector and one which is generating national economic growth which can be distributed in the great programs which we regard as important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I wonder whether the Government understands the management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One Opposition senator said that it is not an easy <span class="highlight">economy</span> to manage but that it is an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has attracted confidence from overseas investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has sought to confuse the private sector and it has made statements which conflict from one Ministry to another, it has taken what seemed to be short term attitudes on investment allowances and export incentives and all those things which allow the private sector to plan for and have an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which it can regard as offering some confident means of development and by which it can make plans so that we shall see the steady growth we need for all the things we want to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I w ‘ould like to think that the Australian Government in taking revaluation decisions is not taking just short term views with regard to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, impending by-elections and decisions which may by politically palatable, but rather that it sees our <span class="highlight">economy</span> as part of a world <span class="highlight">economy</span> facing a world wide inflation with many of the problems which relate to that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that if the Australian Government sees economic management as a true responsibility of government, then many of the measures which still need to be taken will be taken by this Government in the near future and these would have to include one which saw government responsibility in the public sector as being a very great demand on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, of course,  Senator Little  and his colleagues claim that we are an extravagant government; we have been making large handouts, they say, in social service payments and that this is one of the causes of demand on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and one of the reasons for increased liquidity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our education budget is the biggest ever known to the community, and of course those welfare plans have an effect on the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> is related to the world wide <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and inflation, as everybody well knows, is a world wide problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation is a world-wide problem, and it is going to be serious as long as it isn’t tackled in the metropolitan <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of other issues which have added money to the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>, such as pay rates, for the first time in the history of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and for the first time in the history of the defence forces, we have had a complete and comprehensive overhaul of pay scales for the armed Services which, with the increases related to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund, has cost about $70m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot hope to survive and maintain the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the way in which it has provided wealth and a real improvement in the living standards of the people of Australia over the past 23 years if we have a Government which is going to squander the inheritance it secured last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 9 months that this Government has been in office there has been a squandering of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was in good shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the election there was no mention by the Government, which presented itself as a centralist government, of any need to cooperate with the States or of any necessity that the Commonwealth would have to call others in aid in order to handle the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having done these irreparable economic wrongs to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Australian people, he calls everybody in aid in order to assist the Government in its economic dilemma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to reduce the cost of building, the cost of land and the cost of interest charges, and if at any stage the Government has to take measures which temporarily appear to be contrary to any part of that policy, it is only in order to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to pursue our aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think his basic thought about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was sound but I do not suppose we could expect a party to win an election and become the government on that platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is more buoyant today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have always had an admiration for Treasury because of the way in which it rectifies the evils in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by budgetary measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No account has been taken of the effect such pruning could have if there is a downturn in the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will manifest themselves in reduced Service morale, resignations of highly-trained long-term officers who will see a brighter future outside the Services, recruitment problems because of the eroded incentive to join the Navy, Army or the Air Force, reduction of civilian employment opportunities, and the loss to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of country cities and towns where Services installations exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any government coming into power after 23 years is obliged to look at the whole structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its first year of office the Australian Labor Party has made, as I said yesterday, a complete hash of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are the big time spenders and in my judgment are out to dissipate the resources very carefully built up over a long period of time by a better style of operating in a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> with a strong free enterprise emphasis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the private sector- the free enterprise or market <span class="highlight">economy</span>; call it what you will- or the productive sector in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is that produces the growth and resources to spend on Government and social purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expansion is not the right treatment for an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is under resource pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Th e Australian Treasury, in its publication ‘The Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span>, 1973’ published in August 1973 stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the spirit of that guideline and instruction that I have always believed we should try to operate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the arbitration system and the way in which it works, the general shape of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the federal system itself and the methods of demand management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with them one must not ignore the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of decisions to increase wages and decrease working hours without regard to productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a small <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it is rather diverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two points are very clear in the problem of Commonwealth-State relationships which must be mastered if we are to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span> properly and retain inflation within any conscious bounds of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing is clear in my mind: If governments insist totally on making bigger and bigger claims on resources year after year they will run the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s priority for defence, security and social welfare, justice and general well-being would have to be ensured together with the ability to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and maintain stability in the currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the views I advanced on how to operate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know the state of affairs in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was placed and the stop-go method of approaching things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They looked to the Labor Party to put the affairs of this country in order, to introduce some sanity into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to bring in progressive policies which had some initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But essentially I deplore the accelerating effect which - this Budget must have on inflation in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be a confident and active private sector for a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all policies which have an effect on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is good for our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual realisation of anticipated spending in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> fell to its third lowest level in 30 years and that surely indicates that the confidence that was displayed by investors shortly after the election has been tempered by caution completely inconsistent with market conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do have to askourselves whether this is the appropriate time for everything to be undertaken at once, regardless of the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel it could be quite disastrous for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that some of the facts which have been presented and some of the statements which have been asserted will lead the Government to sounder economic management and to the taking of a sense of responsibility in the handling of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a statement made yesterday by the Tasmanian Minister for Agriculture claiming that the Commonwealth Government’s decision to abandon free milk distribution to school children will cost the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> $550,000 per annum and will particularly damage the residents of the west coast area in relation both to cost and availability of milk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring that figure into focus merely to show that real social services cannot be provided unless stability is maintained in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addition of $ 1,938m to theflood of Government expenditure is one of the reasons why the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is galloping towards unparalleled inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But beyond that we get constant reminders from yesterday’s report that experience emphasises that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the rural section is unpredictable; that it is subject to seasonal conditions, international considerations and prevailing market conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great difference from the situation we inherited is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in December combined a high inflation with the worst unemployment for 12 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those people who believe that the tiddling methods- that is all they areadopted by the Government to try to curb the effects that result from a large section of the community doing its utmost to break down the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by unreasonable and impossible demands will fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be no question in anybody’s mind that responsibility for the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> must rest with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stressed earlier that the Liberal and Country Parties have a proud record in terms of the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country for the 23 years in which they were in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I refer to a couple of passages from the Treasury’s review of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was published prior to the Budget of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that this document, ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span>’, is published by the Treasury every year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, at the time the change of government occurred in December 1972 the Labor Party received an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was in good condition and, with the Treasury assessment of the prospects, every reason to believe it would be in a better condition with good economic management as 1973 progressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has been criticising the Government because of inflation, but when it was in government for 23 years it did nothing about inflation except, as  Senator Greenwood  pointed out this afternoon, on the eve of an election in 1972 when it decided to pour money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> needed a boost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 23 years the then Government suddenly decided that it had to pour money into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government did one thing in 23 years- it poured some money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the eve of an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the money which the previous Government poured into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to try to win the election is what this Government is facing up to at this very moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We got cries of horror at what was going to happen to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will increase the degree of competition in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it will have a salutary effect on those who have been exploiting the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was aggravated by the last minute desperate measures of the Government in pouring money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to try to build up support for its election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it tried to get out of the situation on the eve of an election by pouring money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as fast as it could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> shows and as the history of Australia shows, the Constitution of Australia does not give power to the government of the day, whether it be Labor, Liberal, or whatever, to deal with prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is a very worthwhile exercise and it certainly is not a time wasting one because I am sure that when each member of the Government returns to his electorate he is inundated with questions about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say, first of all, that no member of the previous Government or none of the people of this country ever dreamt in the early 1950s that they would experience the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that exists in the early 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of last year or the year before did have a setback but I want to remind the Senate and the people of Australia that this came about because of the rural situation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It still proves to the people of Australia that when there is a setback in the rural industry the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole feels it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am taking part in this debate this afternoon because I believe that the Labor Government stands guilty on 3 major counts concerning the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that, by practically any test we care to make, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today is thriving, and the immediate future looks good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation eats into the very heart of our national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To support the view that I have expressed, namely, that Labor did inherit inflation, I propose to refer briefly to the Treasury White Paper entitled ‘The Australian <span class="highlight">Economy</span> 1972’ published in July 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the previous Government gave constant attention to laying the whole blame for the inflationary tendencies in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the door of the people employed in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the technique employed by the former government at a time when everyone was concerned, as we are now, with the inflationary trend in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was to cut back on public spending and not to increase the payments to recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things the Australian Labor Party said at the time that it was determined to set up a Prices Justification Tribunal and to set up a joint parliamentary committee on prices to review prices in key sectors of industry and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have done is, first of all, appreciate our dollar to try to insulate the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> against the side effects of the American market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 1 per cent and we were told that great disaster would be wrought upon the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the instruments or weapons in its economic armoury that the Government has used to try to insulate our <span class="highlight">economy</span> against the effects of world inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fallacious use of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has caused this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an <span class="highlight">economy</span> as big as Australia’s the fact that 20,000 people more were registered for unemployment benefit at any specific time is not important while we have the social services structure that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why today members of the Democratic Labor Party believe that the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> has to be the responsibility of somebody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and again I have said that we support the idea that only one authority should be responsible for the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s job to manage the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few weeks in which we have been debating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and examining the Budget I have heard all sorts of complaints about not enough money being provided for housing, for pensions and, according to the Democratic Labor Party, for defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has asked the Senate to give the Commonwealth Government power to control prices, to give it an opportunity to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can refer to the documents on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> produced by the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that there was no real attempt to grapple with the problems facing this nation, that they were dealt with on a purely party political basis and not on a basis of assisting this Government to have power to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a buoyant and strongly growing <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with inflationary pressures intense, we are limited by the overriding need to bring down a Budget which does not add to these pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> they used a bludgeon and a stop-go method which led to the great becoming greater and the weak becoming considerably weaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that people who work within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> endeavour to anticipate the decisions of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the 2 major Opposition parties formed the coalition government they did nothing whatsoever to control the flow of money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say is that it was permitted and that it distorted the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the levels of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  painted a glowing picture of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party criteria for making judgments relating to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were based on ecomonic assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cause of inflation is an imbalance in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- for example, too much Government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because he could not stop that growing swell of unemployment, 4 months before the last election he brought down another Budget in a desperate attempt to push money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why when we talk this year of a national effort to combat inflation we need to draw attention to the responsibility of government with regard to the activities of the public sector and the consequential effect which that has on the internal <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not opposed to Commonwealth public servants receiving an extra week’s annual leave, but we should exercise more responsibility before creating a competitive situation where Commonwealth public servants are leading the field in these matters which, in fact, are very costly to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it quite incredible that the Prime Minister, having created all this turbulent chaos in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, should ask the Australian people to put into the hands of politicians the power to control prices in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course Diocletian did not have an <span class="highlight">economy</span> to administer based on the same concepts as we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government must have been well aware, not because of the long history of inflation but because of statements made since it gained office and in particular in the fortnight before it sought election that one of its great problems would be to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, wasted a lot of the time of this Parliament and delayed the opportunity for it to get down to the essential matters of inflation in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such matters made no contribution to the control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or inflation of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, for the first time is a glimmer of something which may effect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in terms of controlling inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of the time that was spent by the Parliament in discussing that issue could have been better spent on an examination of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation and of the steps necessary to rescue it from the abyss of inflation into which it was rapidly sliding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a government which introduced maternity leave should also have introduced other measures to counter its inflationary effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whatever their limitations are- and we are all aware of one another’s limitations- they have been charged by the people of the nation with the responsibility of trying to solve the problem of the control of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was very honourably done, but accepting it in the context that it is an honourable statement it is most necessary that the Government of this country should immediately say: ‘If we are to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, if we are to control inflation, we must control prices and incomes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say to this Government, based on the things which I will not reiterate but which I have already stated in debates on this economic question, as we have said to this Governments’ predecessors in government over the years: ‘It is our judgment and our advice to you that an attempt to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation by controlling prices alone is doomed to failure and is sheer stupidity, almost to the extent of hypocrisy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does want to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation and to fight inflation, I make this offer to the Government: Provided that the Government retains the principle that incomes should be controlled, it can move an amendment to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would not use the power to help industry or the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, not a bit; they would use it to torment and override the industrial people on whom we depend almost absolutely for our own prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it would be a very much better proposition to include income control- to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in such a straitjacket as to control prices and also incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is most certainly a frightening attitude and it illustrates what would happen if a bureaucracy was in charge, able to murder industry and incentive and to impose a most unfair situation on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its components generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no hesitation in saying that it is directly attributable to mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the present Government since it assumed office last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can do much more harm by allowing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to run away than by applying measures of good demand management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How irresponsible it is in a time of very buoyant conditions and an overheated <span class="highlight">economy</span> for the Government to introduce a Budget which provides for a deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it still is not satisfied and is pumping more and more into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to worsen the situation which we now experience generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is far better stringently to impose fiscal provisions in the first instance and to have a continual improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one can by sound management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- this was shown during the last 23 years- control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> despite the economic influences being exerted upon it by overseas situations of higher prices and inflationary conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that we are now in a real state of emergency because of the high inflation rate in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot see any great merit in a policy which says price control is the panacea for all the evils within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has done nothing at all about the problem and has performed badly in letting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> get into this condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over these years the Liberal-Country Party Government was able to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which gave business the opportunity to grow and to progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to stress again the uncertainty and confusion within the industry itself at present and to point out to the members of the Government that short term decisions taken for long term investment in developed industries which are so valuable to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> are unwise political decisions in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me make it quite clear that I certainly would not agree to giving any further powers to a Government such as this which has shown itself to be incompetent in managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to a Prime Minister who has shown quite clearly his inability to understand economics or even to lead his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, we ought to be seeking to give this Australian Parliament every legislative power which would enable it to exercise the proper management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and there should be no hairsplitting over how far this goes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the use of her electronics industry, her shipbuilding industry and her capacity to produce all the articles required in war are the key to the success of any war in the Indian Ocean region, in the same way as the military strength of the United States in this area may be the key to countries respecting Australia’s peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On what is the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> built today if it is not built on Australia’s capacity to produce iron ore, bauxite, copper and nickel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that by practically any test we care to make the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today is thriving and the immediate future looks good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Treasurer was prepared to say a little less than 3 weeks ago- ‘by some strange good fortune the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> looks good ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the tremendous increases that will wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and put every country newspaper out of business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all the time we are finding that increases in charges and costs, like a dog chasing its tail, add to the inflationary propensities within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that these further charges are being imposed at a time when inflation, which has been caused by the activities of the Labor Government, has put the business community, and indeed the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in quite a plight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They enable particular enterprises or groups of enterprises to attain positions of economic dominance which are then susceptible to abuse; they interfere with the interplay of competitive forces which are the foundation of any market <span class="highlight">economy</span>; they allow discriminatory action against small businesses, exploitation of consumers and feather-bedding of industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The progress being made under the existing Act is such that it would be many years before the legislation had any significant impact on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no evidence at all to indicate that there is an appreciation of the fact that rural industry, through a series of years of adverse climatic conditions and low prices, has had a time of difficulty which no other sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is excellent to think that we have industries infusing prosperity into our nation and substance into our <span class="highlight">economy</span> other than the traditional rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well to criticise the Government because at a time of inflation steps have to be taken which would have an effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> overall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me tell the honourable senator that the Government considers legislation concerning the operation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia to be urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trade practices legislation is one of the essential ingredients on which the Government puts some reliance for controlling the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the only new money that is generated in the community so that all sectors of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> may survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably, though not in this context, we could argue the respective merits of a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a socialist <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But are we to shackle our <span class="highlight">economy</span>- and this is what the Opposition is talking about- by using this broad stopper, which is all it is, of ‘in the public interest’ against people working in industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are to tighten up on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, whether it be incomes or prices, let us determine it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that if all these bans were lifted, the demands on resources in the building industry would seriously worsen the inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and harm the Government’s endeavours to solve the housing crisis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the function of a trade union to determine the question of the general management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is something which the Federal Government can attend to if it is given appropriate powers by this Parliament or by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the Constitution permits and this Parliament allows the laws to be made, the Federal Government will manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if this Parliament or one section of it sets out to prevent the Federal Government having ample powers to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the people of Australia will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the monopoly power of the maritime unions in Australia is being used to impose conditions on Tasmanian trade that threaten to throttle that trade, and it is doing continuing damage to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many things which would have caused disputes in other States have been overlooked in Tasmania because of the recognition by the trade union movement of the particular <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So at least the  Deputy  Prime Minister, when speaking in Launceston in his own electorate, is prepared to recognise what  Senator Cavanagh  is not prepared to recognise- that is, the fundamental importance of the disruptive effect of strike action on the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and Tasmanian shipping services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have got to a stage with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania where we need help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to extend this system to industries in other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because it believes the system has, over a long period, proved its value to successive governments in an important and difficult area of government decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first stems essentially from the fact that the Commission will be a single institution, with the responsibility for advising on the assistance which should be given to industries in all sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has inherited a complex, confusing and inconsistent collection of measures which discriminate between individual industries- particularly as between primary and secondary sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause covers any industry, whether in the primary, secondary or tertiary sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the mandatory provision relates to questions of assistance to individual industries in the primary and secondary sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but not to industries in the tertiary sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply indicate shortly that the Bill deals in a comprehensive way with those practices which have been injuring the community and which have led to private price fixing, to contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade, to monopolisation, exclusive dealing, price discrimination, anti-competitive mergers and conduct which is recognised all round the world as being against the proper operation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest menace confronting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today is inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a lot of things I do not agree with in a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> but I know that consumers over there have a lot of protection which we lack here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we suggest there should be some reform in the performances of industry in a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> we are told that such action represents interference with the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of the general economic balance of the country, I believe that, together with consultation with the States as to their programs of works, which of course are very great indeed, in conjunction with our programs and taking them into annual review so that they are rolling on year by year, a program covering a period of 3 to 5 years would give to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country a balancing wheel that we have not had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is proper that one interested in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> should have some concern about what I believe has been set in operation by this socialist Government in the creation of havoc in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in ensuing years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when obviously the Government must pay some regard to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it has seen fit to enter into some expenditures which surely are unnecessary at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this is one further step by the Government to achieve centralised powers, not just over a harmless word or a seemingly harmless word called ‘prices’, but over virtually the complete private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those proud members of the Labor Party were to rise- they now have the opportunityand ask for an election of the House of Representatives next May, at the same time as the Senate election is held, they would save the people a great deal of bother and money and would save putting a great deal of strain on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are pleased that the Bill contains a provision which makes allowance for the fact that the policies of the previous Government, the present Government and maybe the succeeding government on matters affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation are such that we must expect continued inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that there would be very few people- I trust that the honourable senator is not amongst them- who would think that the Commonwealth Government ought not to be given the powers per medium of the Australian Parliament to take the administrative action pursuant to laws made by this Parliament which would enable us to curb inflation and to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the main reason why certain shortages have crept into certain areas of manufactured goods is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is booming along in a manner which we have not seen for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it an arbitrary or excessive power to introduce legislation such as the Trade Practices Bill in order to break down the power of economic monopolies and oligopolies which rule the economic life of the Australian people; to see that the people can participate in a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which we still have, on a basis of some equality, or to remove a situation in which there is not government regulation but regulation by private monopolies about which the previous Government said it was going to do something but about which it did nothing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will ask him at the conclusion of my remarks to state where there is a direction in this clause which prescribes the functions and the duties of the Commission to indicate that protection and financial assistance shall be given to support efficient and economic industries on their own account in the context of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are objectives with which we would not disagree but they are so general as to be unhelpful from the point of view of getting an Industries Assistance Commission to recommend financial assistance in the case in which a particular industry needs assistance to make it economic and viable in the general Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only wish to make my own comment that it is strange that there is an entire omission to direct that this Commission shall consider the need for financial assistance for the applicant industry for the purpose of its economic and efficient maintenance in the totality of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the troubles, though, is that because of the lack of power of the Government over the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is not possible to see to it that the goods are available to the community at the prices at which they ought to be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to look at the national wage case and Government policy in this regard when we are talking about economic management in the present context, because we have seen in the Government’s policy and in the Government’s attitude the real danger in the growth of inflation in the present <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on this occasion we find a Government policy which is styled by the Department of Labour, and we wonder whether it has the support of the Australian Treasury and all the responsibility which should flow from the body in the Government which has so much responsibility for the handling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the difficulties which we have seen in the handling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> flow in various directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters appear to me to lack a continuity of policy making that we would want to see in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is showing the strains that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is experiencing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, manufacturing industry has asked the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to consider issuing short term economic forecasts and establishing regular consultations between industry and government on policies designed to overcome the effect of the world energy crisis, for one thing, on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some confusion in industry as to what role industry needs to play in the rehabilitation of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will need to be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government that some sort of short term economic forecasts would be of great advantage to the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, it has created uncertainty in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> with regard to forward planning for investment for development and for the opportunity to provide the constant employment which we would like to see as part of the Australian commercial scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another source of distortion of economic development at this time when a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span> is so badly needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find very little evidence of the skill of this Government in containing inflation or showing any sound economic management in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are things which we feel should attract the attention of the national Parliament because we firmly believe that inflation in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a great national question and requires the skill and dedication of us all in attempting to combat it in this year of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation and uncertainty in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and an endangering of the federal system are two of the important situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Side by side with the detrimental effect of inflation on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are the problems created by rising interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had an active migration program which concentrated on these areas, we would have more people contributing to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and fewer people totally dependent on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, at that time wool represented something like 50 per cent of the export income of this nation and because so much money came into the country the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> was buoyant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can have all sorts of ideas on the betterment of living standards and social services and the advancement of the nation, but unless we have our <span class="highlight">economy</span> soundly based we cannot achieve those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government believes the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is basically strong and buoyant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> these days we have an unreal buoyancy and that in fact we are living in something of a fool’s paradise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to have moneys expended in many areas, but there is no need for undue haste in creating demands in the public sector which in themselves not only affect the actual cost to the public sector but in the process also have a real impact on the private sector and on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s immigration policy has not assisted the sound development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed removal of the superphosphate bounty can be referred to as an indication of lack of understanding of what is helpful in keeping down prices within an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this sort of attitude which gives me very deep concern when 1 view the present very unreal situation, as I assess it, with our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>caused uncertainty and its management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is creating social inequities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me, so far as inflation and our <span class="highlight">economy</span> are concerned, that we are far along the road to becoming one of those despised States of South America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The remarkable fact about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is its dramatic and healthy change over the past 6 months. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government believes the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is basically strong and buoyant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government says that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sound and strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely only those who want to be gulled will take any notice of the Prime Minister whenever he makes any pronouncement about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, for that matter, about other things in this country where the position is rapidly going from bad to worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were not asking for special privileges but that during those odd good times we might be able to cool the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to put something away for a rainy day instead of being asked to pay an exorbitantly high taxation rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has an advantage from the point of view of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present government is using the various mechanisms which are available to it, including this interest rate mechanism, to try to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Obviously, the Government regards the supply and the price of fuel as an integral part of the factors upon which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is largely uncontrolled, where the Federal Government does not have the powers of managementwhich obviously it ought to have- to regulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as other countries do, the honourable senator suggests that in some way the Government is able to do simply what it likes without reference to the forces which in many ways control what the Government can do in this sphere as well as in others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has developed a strong, well-balanced and advancing <span class="highlight">economy</span> through the initiative, drive and efficiency of free enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am utterly committed to a policy whereby government provides the framework in which the initiatives, the ingenuities and the abilities of persons and companies can operate and in that way retain the verve, the go and the drive which lead to the success which has marked the growth and development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> since we became a federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wage increases may be justified and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> may be able to cope with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unless we gear leave and shorter hours to the capacity of industry to recapitalise and to generate more productivity in the same time- however desirable this may be for those who receive it- we impose an enormous inflationary impetus on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which, if it occurs at the same time as wages are being increased, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot absorb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He feared the continuation and expansion of the inflationary influences in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, it will have the effect of dampening down some new activity at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot stand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prospective increase in the money supply, although well below that in 1972-73, remained too large, given the buoyancy of demand and the growing full employment <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its ability directly to control activities of some of the major sources of housing finance, and to exert a major influence on the general financial climate of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Commonwealth Government has been in a position to markedly affect levels of activity in the housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking for the Government, I counter that by pointing out that the buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a deliberate result of our policy to redistribute incomes and to revise priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to one of the problems that besets our <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I might coin a term used by a former Prime Minister, the late Ben Chifley, when he referred to the people who really keep the wheels of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> rolling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise that a certain price must be paid to develop our national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but I would call it moderate nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some inconveniences may be experienced but the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is being kept within reasonable bounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Each public servant who puts a.foot outside his own town or city on official business is entitled to first class air travel- unlike the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and many other countries where only very senior officers are entitled to travel first class, with <span class="highlight">economy</span> class travel provided for other members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board also estimated that if all these public servants had travelled <span class="highlight">economy</span> class approximately $ 1.2m would have been saved on domestic journeys and $0.75m on international journeys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the time in which they can discuss and debate vital issues affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and matters that they believe are of great importance to the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March of last year the Senate Opposition, through its spokesman on social services matters,  Senator Rae,  expressed to the Senate and to the people of Australia a clear warning about the basic defect of the philosophy of the Labor Government in its approach to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to pensions, and a warning of what was likely to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He set out to make the point that no policy on social services could be taken in isolation and that a pension, in terms of itself, was as nothing unless it was related to the stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope, and I am sure all honourable senators on this side of the chamber hope, that the Government will realise that some of the matters on which it has embarked already will have a disastrous effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> unless they can be curbed and unless they can be related further to sound development and the curtailment of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a prepared address to the Securities Institute of Australia  Mr Crean  talked about his philosophy for controlling the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, keeping down inflation and, therefore, increasing purchasing power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Liberal-Country Party Government gave anything it gave stability to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and real emphasis to the purchasing power of the rising real wages of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation should be sufficiently virilent to give them a standard of living that is theirs by right, not by the charity of politicians who sit in places like this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course pensioners have the right to be as well off as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation can sustain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that son of appreciation of what makes an <span class="highlight">economy</span> tick they could not run the corner store, let alone a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether this Government is capable of controlling the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country has been well noted in the past 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No member of the Government nor of the Opposition could be proud of the record relating to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> which the Government has demonstrated in the last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he did not draw the attention of pensioners to the fact that even though the Government is giving them a $3 a week pension increase, it has, through its management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, brought about a 14 per cent depreciation in the pensioners’ spending power or in the value of the dollar during last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Really, that is the position with our <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless the judicial systemboth bench and legal profession- takes an early opportunity to introduce <span class="highlight">economy</span>, expedition and simplicity, it will fail to serve the high purposes that it should serve for our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As successive Attorneys-General on the Liberal and Country Party side of politics examined the original proposal it became more and more difficult to give to any proposed Superior Court a practical jurisdiction which would add anything to the efficiency or <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the judicial system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That judge, having an insight denied in equal measure to any other contemporary lawyer, found it an intricate, confusing and arid field of study and one which defeated the practical objectives that I have enunciated as the purpose of a judicial system- <span class="highlight">economy</span>, simplicity and expedition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a stable industry and it would not be affected by the small, short term peaks and troughs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to know what the consequences of small mistakes can be to consumers when we are dealing with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because those small mistakes which the Labor Government made in the initial days when it was ruling have caused enormous calamities for hosts of people in the intervening months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure of the prices referendum and the incomes referendum makes the Trade Practices Bill the most important Bill if we are to combat inflation and the misuse of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which occurs each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am submitting to this House, therefore, is a record of achievement in regard to the nation’s defence capability; major improvements in conditions of service of our servicemen and women; greater efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> in defence organisation and spending; and a prudent and responsible defence posture for present circumstances and the future strategic prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Government’s inability to properly and responsibly manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has placed at serious risk the viability of Australian industry and caused widespread uncertainty throughout the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition attitudes on these matters were so clear in endeavouring to obstruct the Government in its management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that when the Opposition foolishly brought about the double dissolution its members got their deserts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have also implemented a policy of structural change within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> whereby we will assist industries which are affected as a result of Government decisions- an initiative that has never previously been taken in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Inflation will be at least 20 per cent by the end of this year because of the Labor Government’s blundering mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These prices and the result they have had on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been a saving grace in this second part of my time away from the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say we are aware of that because it seems to me even more dangerous to express an even greater determination to carry out a series of actions that are in fact bringing about some of the disastrous situations in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are just a few of the things that are happening around us which are tending to destroy a great <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a great society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But tonight we listened to a speech that outlined the transition from compulsory arbitration and an ordered series of resolutions of industrial disputes to a socalled system of collective bargaining whereby combinations of industries are continually pounding their pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and producing increases in economic rates which permit of no stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister explain to the Senate where a benefit will occur to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> or to Australian citizens in general by an increase in the interest rates paid by those who have existing home loans? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I indicated then the steps that the Government was taking in respect of the adjustments in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which are now appearing as a result of the tariff cuts last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In May 1971 the ACTU Executive recognised the dependance of the jobs of Tasmanian workers on regular and adequate shipping services and called upon the participants of any strike which has the effect of stopping shipping services to Tasmania to give consideration to the particular position of the Island’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to take such steps as are practicable and required to cause the least disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new terminology to describe this, of course, is ‘to reconstruct the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While dealing with foreign affairs I point out that recently I returned from a visit to the People’s Republic of China which is a socialist state and a totally organised <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, in case anyone confuses that sort of more or less rational economist’s approach with the practices which have been followed in Australia for the past couple of decades, I point out that a subsidy is paid to an export industry because it suffers a comparative disadvantage by reason of the fact that it is an export industry and because we live within a protected <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is near tragic that the self-professed partisans of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a free enterprise system who face us across the Senate chamber- I refer also to those outside the Parliament and to those in State Parliaments- seem to be completely unable to grasp the crucial role of a pricing system in a market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the rationale for investment incentives I would like to place before the House the simple fact that it is also a rationale for a centrally planned <span class="highlight">economy</span> since both presuppose that governments are better able than private investors or business managers to make sensible decisions in that area or, as the right wing rural propagandists would say, a rationale for the collectivisation of agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am neither for nor against government intervention in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> per se. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further reason for the gloom is an air of uncertainty, doubt and concern as to the ability of this Government, controlled by the persons who are its senior Ministers at present, to control this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite apart from the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which must give concern in a great number of areas: Firstly, as to whether overtime will continue and, secondly, as to whether there is security of employment for people who find overtime dropping and who wonder whether there will be sackings in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 man in this Government, the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  should have said yesterday, if he has been reported correctly, and I understand that it has not been denied, that the Government was presiding over the destruction of this nation ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will you again entrust the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the men who deliberately, but needlessly, created Australia’s worst unemployment for 10 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those facts will become apparent because a massive down-turn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not obscure the basic realities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This nation has an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which depends upon profitability but it is being throttled because profitability is being unfairly penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a weakening of the most fundamental sector in our community, the rural sector, by the taking away of those incentives which have made the rural sector profitable and which have enabled productivity to sustain a growing <span class="highlight">economy</span> and also to provide handsome export earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has not been one substantive suggestion yet from the long term senators as to how the ills of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> are to be remedied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such is his professed concern now about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that it is obvious that he knew inflation was rapidly worsening at the time when he told the nation that it had been contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known fact that if, in any <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there is an excess of liquidity and not sufficient supply obviously an inflationary situation will develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, if there is far too great a circulation of money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> you can expect inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, if there is far too great a supply and insufficient liquidity you can expect a recession in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years immediately preceding this Party’s advent to Government we find, by looking at the increase in liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a starkly different position from that which obtained in the first year in which we took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in the flow of money in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the financial year to the end of June 1968 was 8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there was an abnormal increase in the amount of liquidity in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this resulted in placing an intolerable burden on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it was inevitable that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not possibly meet that situation in the space of 12 months or even 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we are still living in the aftermath of that massive inflow of money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the massive increase of money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> it was necessary for us to take the steps we took to increase supply through increased imports and to revalue the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there is excess liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it might be harmful and distasteful to have to do these things insofar as housing loans are concerned, for example, they are necessary for the overall benefit of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and these things needed to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said just now, the purpose is to ensure that the flow of money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be restrained to a reasonable degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will continue its measures to strengthen and modernise the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to improve the quality of the Australian workforce, to expand Australian resources and to promote Australian control over those resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But put in simple terms as an economist put it the other day- some are sensible and logical- it is this: ‘Rising prices are caused by attempts by the people as a whole to have a higher standard of living than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can afford ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interest of open government will the Minister advise the Senate of the names, designations and recommendations of Treasury officials currently advising the Australian Government on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party believes that people in industry whose contributions to the national well being is vital- and surely the rural industries are vital to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country- should not be deprived by their geographical isolation of the right te adequate and equal representation in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another subject relates to the Government’s inability to properly and responsibly manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the shambles into which it has reduced the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the industrial chaos in this country, I would think that, if every elector had the right to speak tonight, the Labor Party’s claim in another place to govern this country would disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an important thing to consider when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia is facing strain; and it is important to consider how we can afford to divert from the private sector, from private responsibility, increasing demands on Government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be subject to rapid and extreme socialistic measures which would significantly and permanently weaken our free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, was that a false claim or is the present mere 16’/i per cent rate of inflation attributable to causes which have thrust themselves upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> only since the end of March this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Bill of great significance to the mining industry, to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to the States because of its impact on the mining laws and mining administration of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Bill gives the Authority far wider powers and a role of very much greater importance in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an uncertainty which can do nothing but harm to the capacity of Australia to develop an area of its <span class="highlight">economy</span> which must be developed on an enormous scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that they would prefer me to finish before hearing the statements on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When you are frightened of what is going on in your domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as he was, when you are frightened and scared of inflation, as he was, and when inflation is getting out of hand, you create a diversion or a confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he further agree that there is an absolute urgency for the Government to strongly support the Corporation because of the basic relationship of the wool industry to the overall balance of Australian primary production and that weakness at this point will herald another catastrophic era in a broad area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the Treasurer’s announcement last night that the Government had decided to defer or drastically cut back its social welfare program, a program enunciated and much vaunted only 2 months ago when the Government must have known exactly the health of the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, what programs other than those outlined by the Treasurer last night have been deferred or curtailed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide the basis for the examination and, as necessary, regulation of activities in the non-bank financial sector in the interests of effective management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These could supplement, as necessary, existing monetary policy weapons so as to assist in the effective overall management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present Government has held the reins for nearly 2 years and I believe it is following the very harshest wishes of a socialist regime, not only in debauching the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia- as has been demonstrated in the last 18 months and is being currently demonstrated- but also in pursuing a course which eventually will bring about Labor’s philosophy of total ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> by a central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anybody could stand and say that the actions of the Labor Party in its 1 8 months in government have been for the good of the Australian community in any area, I would applaud and say that there must be something good in Labor philosophy You interrupted me,  Mr Acting Deputy President  when I was speaking about how this Government had debauched the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also understand that the findings of the mission were that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in that country was in a very bad shape, that in fact the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can pay for only 6 per cent of its total imports and less than one-fifth of its total budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would appear that as a result of meetings of some countries connected with the World Bank organisation it was decided that the United States of America would grant, through the World Bank, up to US$400m per annum to Saigon for at least 20 years to aid that country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Time is a very important factor in the public’s confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole and in members of Parliament and the attitudes they may take to the acceptance of the determinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they say they did not know until yesterday what was the substance of the rises, then, quite frankly, they are not up with general reporting, if it takes so long to assess what the determinations mean to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> then I suggest that honourable senators go out and ask the chambers of commerce to which  Senator Webster  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt that any agreement or award giving an increase of 38 per cent or a straight out lump sum of $5,500 a year either in private industry or in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been made since the Remuneration Tribunal Act of last year came into force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, we have to recognise that an increase in wage costs is a very important factor in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country at present, and we have to recognise the responsibility of the Parliament not to award to itself an increase which is excessive when related to other classes in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I refer to the other sections of the Tribunal’s award and determination I shall ask honourable senators to consider the impact that a salary of $35,000 a year for heads of departments, First Division officers, in this country will make upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Public Service and then upon the general <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say without exaggeration that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> now faces a highly dangerous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adoption of that method of wage explosion and wage destruction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is getting to a stage which fully justifies the Treasurer’s description of it being a highly dangerous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this country is to be saved from destruction of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, Parliament has the absolutely inescapable responsibility to deny a determination such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statements made by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  are correct and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in such a position that it needs corrective action, that corrective action should be taken in the coming Budget by the use of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently it anticipated, for some reason or other, that we would come into this place and say that the state of the nation and of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were such that we ought not to accept the increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that every time increases in parliamentary salaries are mooted we are told it is not the rightime, that it is Christmas time, that we are just about to go into an election or that there is a problem in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My motivation for supporting  Senator Wright’s  motion is the deep concern that I have for the present state of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and my fear that were the increases as set out in the review implemented the repercussions in the inflationary spiral would be disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cannot be denied that we have reached a crisis in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present of a degree that we have never experienced in the history of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that honourable senators have to be completely appreciative of the repercussions which would flow through the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, at a common crisis, to the detriment of those people to whom we feel we should give the most consideration in respect of retention of value in our money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say without exaggeration that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> now faces a highly dangerous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is allowed to reach such a stage that there is hopelessness all about, then we have set the pattern or the background for major upheavals in our society as we now know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was the first movement of a pretty active <span class="highlight">economy</span> heading into an inflationary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is carried out by a Government, by a cabinet, by a ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They enable particular enterprises or groups of enterprises to attain positions of economic dominance which are then susceptible to abuse; they interfere with the interplay of competitive forces which are the foundation of any market <span class="highlight">economy</span>; they allow discriminatory action against small businesses, exploitation of consumers and feather-bedding of industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The progress being made under the existing Act is such that it would be many years before the legislation had any significant impact on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meaning the Post Office-  which has a profound effect upon every part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, every endeavour ought to be made to keep the charges as low as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the wide range of services provided by the Post Office, these increases go rapidly right throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the minister intend as an <span class="highlight">economy</span> measure to re-think his approach to the Black Mountain project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that statement we see that the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  reviews the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in relation to housing, says such things as: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without exaggeration that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> now faces a highly dangerous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are now giving us a lecture on business management and management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country but if what has happened over the last 18 months is any indication of how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be managed I think we are better off without the advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia have been concerned for quite some time about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation whereby increased costs, be they by way of taxation and costs of services within a State or be they by the cost of goods and services provided by industry and commerce, amount to another cost factor in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until it had that situation whereby it was shown clearly that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is racing towards a 20 per cent rate of inflation that it even admitted that we have an inflationary problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A statement was made about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in one way or anotherthis measure is an example- is overturning the whole structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Bill also provides that the Corporation must have regard to the importance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the industry concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I take the opportunity to comment upon the fact that the need to introduce such a Bill is related very much to the inflation which is within our Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time and to the rise of the 4.1 per cent in the consumer price index for the June quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While looking at the rise in the consumer price index we also note that an expenditure which is of alarming proportions in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is that which relates to rented premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will have benefits so far as managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is concerned- in due course, not immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of measure is a necessary corollary to a reserve or central bank situation in a nation like Australia- a country with a sophisticated <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is developing rather fast and which, although it is not large, as a trader and a country of economic consequence has a position in the world scene higher than its population might otherwise justify and is more subject to the problems of world trade and world monetary movements than are many other countries whose production does not pass into world trade to anything like the same extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Management of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> rests upon considerations of monetary and fiscal policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the proposal that is contained in this legislation to strengthen the monetary arm has to be viewed in the context that this is a difficult and sophisticated <span class="highlight">economy</span> and an <span class="highlight">economy</span> with problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a basis for the examination and, as necessary, regulation of activities in the nonbanking financial sector in the interests of the effective management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general purpose is the regulation of activity in the non-bank financial sector in the interests of the effective management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed by this Bill that the Government will be able, as a government, to safeguard and effectively manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is notable that  Sir Robert  Gibson, the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank which was then, I suppose we could call it, the central reserve bank- it was actually the principal instrument of government banking- was summonsed before the Senate to discuss with senators the consequences of what was happening in Australia in terms of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, its prosperity and its currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been introduced to assist the Australian Government to achieve effective management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been recognised and accepted as the main purposes that a monetary and banking system should serve in a modern <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I have said, the great growth in the number of intermediaries has raised other significant implications for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and responsibilities for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The purpose of the Financial Corporations Bill is said to be to set the basis for the examination and regulation of activities of the non-bank financial sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with previous speakers who have said that at the present time general influences and pressures are being exerted from day to day by very large financial institutions and corporations which are not pure banking institutions, and that this is having a great effect on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One certainly can see that the use of credit in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Minister’s statement that there should be regulations covering the activities of that financial sector of the community is in the interests of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see a great shadow looming over our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, cast mainly by a Government which wishes to have this monolithic social control over private industry, by classing, in the first instance, large retailers in our community as financial institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lenin once said: ‘If you wish to control the capitalist society, debauch their <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To provide the Government with control over the financial system at this time would permit it not only to restructure financial markets but also to use that control as a powerful instrument to effect social objectives; that is, to change the structure of the existing market and the existing <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These powers, taken as a conglomerate, give the Government absolute control over the existing system in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and I question the outcome of the use of some of these powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present situation of other tensions in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will affect the employment situation it is appropriate to remember that the sorts of companies which use consumer credit finance employ more than 1,500,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill aims to extend this type of regulation into the activities of the non-bank sector in the interests of effective management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why it is necessary in the submission of this Government- I think that this was largely agreed to by the 2 Opposition senators to whom I have referred- for it to enter this field is the development that has been going on in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> with regard to the financial structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it has been denied by speakers from the other side that especially in a situation such as the one which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> faces today any central government requires all the weapons on which it can lay its hands in order to be able to cope with these pressing, difficult and complex economic problems which face every advanced industrial society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These control powers, it is suggested, will be in line with those that presently exist in regard to banks and they are designed to assist the Government in the effective overall management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a whole range of methods of trying to get a balance of supply and demand in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that the real value of money is maintained and so that, through productivity, real purchasing power can be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can certainly sympathise with those who manage our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and who say that they would like to be able to draw into the general financial controls in Australia these non-banking institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the importance of the fringe banking system in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is necessary that certain controls over its activities be in the hands of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to accept the invitation to debate the question of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time, as was suggested by  Senator Webster  before the sitting of the Senate was suspended for dinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to assist the Australian Government to achieve effective management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by providing a means for- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasoning behind this proposed amendment is that we believe that housing is an essential element of a reasonably stable and prosperous <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing is one of the most important economic regulators a country has and if it is subject to violent fluctuations up and down it subjects the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> to danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment does not merely contain the particular object of housing but is concerned with the aggregate or whole object, that is, to assist the Australian Government to achieve effective management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by providing a means for certain proposals which are set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that they do not succeed because if they do they will only do their section of the community harm and they will do the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> harm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has a program for dealing with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of endeavouring to manage inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in the management of expenditure and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, has decided that there should be cutbacks in certain subsidies in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we believe that our posture will lead to better protection for individual corporations and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not successful in having that view carried- we may not be- in due course, if problems occur, at least we as an Opposition will be able to say that we tried to achieve a situation which we believed protected not only the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general but also individual parts of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is desirable that short term economic stabilisation measures be able to be introduced, and introduced quickly, in response to the rapidly changing circumstances in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which may apply at any particular time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may bring to the attention of the Senate not merely the comparison between the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the dairy farmer and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the potential occupant of this property that is to be purchased, but also the petrol subsidy for country dwellers, I point out that last night, after a rancid debate, the Caucus tore itself apart and came out with a magical majority of three for the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  thereby depriving the outback countryman of a little concession he had been granted because of the exorbitant costs of transporting petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when that project comes forward we might gain a little more insight into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is it incompetent in running the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; it is not even competent to put forward a sensible Bill in regard to the Minister’s prize public relations campaign against the health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The fact that we are debating this Commonwealth Electoral Bill for the fourth time is in itself an explanation of the chaotic position in which we find our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, our society and our nation- a nation that was described in the Press yesterday as being on the brink of anarchy, a nation that is supposed by many to be tottering on the brink of economic chaos, a country with increasing unemployment, high and rising inflation and an incredible increase in the number of strikes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate has been brought about solely by the selfinterest of the Australian Labor Party in endeavouring to entrench itself in a way which is in the interests neither of the nation nor of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which the Government is charged to administer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt a tremendous crisis exists generally in the administration of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other preliminary observation I make is that I wonder whether when those in the future come to read of this occasion- I forbear from using that adjective which seems to jar upon so many people- they will have a towering impression of the high sense of relevance that grips the Australian Parliament in dealing with a Bill of this nature, to add 4 new senators to the .Australian Parliament, at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is tottering and when disaffection is present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They sincerely believed that they could improve our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is up to the politicians to reform the monster before it bankrupts the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and destroys itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in disastrous shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it is the policy of my Party to abolish the means test and I thought it was the policy of the Government to do so, but its spending in other directions, which has reduced the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to dire straits, has not allowed it to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar is not allowed to discuss the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or anything else; he is allowed to talk only about the reason why my ruling should be disagreed with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence the desire of people for social improvement is stifled by the ability of the modern government and the modern <span class="highlight">economy</span> to supply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the long run, the development of the Australian petroleum and mineral industries will lead to major structural changes within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it little wonder that the Government is now crawling back to the people who are capable of bringing tens of millions of dollars into this country to give us at least some reservoir of finance to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government has any doubts about what I am saying, let me refer to the capital investment figures prior to its taking over of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation, prior to the beginnings of the conditioning of the industry to being crushed by the Bill before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no need for this sort of extravagant authority in order properly to control and direct the important areas of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extraordinary to imagine that sums in the vicinity of $200m a year could be envisaged for this sort of unnecessary involvement in government ownership at a time when this very Government has arbitrarily, by the stroke of a pen, taken away $ 1 30m from the area of child care, and has taken away, by another stroke of a pen, $28m which has been directed to keep some sort of balance in the price of petrol throughout this vast community, throughout this vast <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ours is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> and is likely to stay so in the lifetime of any one of us in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also had to take account of our commitments to other programs of high priority such as education, health and social welfare and above all of the general state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the sell-out of these sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which led the Australian people to express tremendous concern about the whole question of foreign investment in Australia in 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the real importance and significance of the National Investment Fund to the Australian people is that it will enable not only foreign investors and Australian financial institutions but also Australian citizens- be they wealthy or relatively poor- who wish to invest in the expansion of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to have a slice of the cake, as it were, and to invest through the National Investment Fund in great national enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it can be of great help m the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by helping to promote the growth of producer and farmer co-operatives and assisting marketing programs for rural industry by the growth of those types of cooperatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to look at this Bill constructively with a view to making it a Bill which will work as well as its general intent can permit in the interests of regulating trade practices in the interests of the consumer and in the interests of a competitive <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would be the most foolish House of Legislature in Australia if we were to enact legislation in such a form that it was an offence or contrary to the law for that efficient, growing manufacturer to take advantage of the position that he had built up by his efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the years to deter me or prevent me from entering into the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, he is engaged in the business of selling his wines in a competitive <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the cheaper he can sell and the more he can sell the better it is, and the consumer and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> derive benefit from that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has found it necessary, over the last 12 months or more, to apply the mechanism of increased interest rates in order to get rid of some of the excess liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as an important official of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement he is attempting to encourage the unions in this particular period to take stock of what is going on in the inflationary <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to consider that perhaps their actions ought to be more measured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst Ministers may protest and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  may find a scapegoat in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it is the Federal Government which is the responsible party to handle the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is allowed to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and fails to manage it properly, the Opposition may then complain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition has no right whatever to complain of the state of affairs in the community when it is refusing to allow the Government to pass measures which it deems necessary in order to deal with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall the Budget is likely to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> growing strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Are the current record rate of inflation, the seriously rising unemployment, the negative productivity and the virtual collapse of capital investment indications of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> growing strongly, or rather of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> approaching a crisis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget papers which will be presented tonight the honourable senator will have ample opportunity to see that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in nothing like the state that he suggests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent increases in interest rates on savings bank housing loans follow increases which have occurred in other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-82-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are afraid to discuss the issues concerning the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may seem curious to some honourable senators that, at a time when the Opposition is asserting that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a situation of acute crisis, it finds time to play to the Senate today a tired old barrel organ tune entitled ‘Variations on a Theme by Joe McCarthy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Senate ought to get on with the business of assisting the Government to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunities for this industry in Australia are tremendous but the attitude of our Government unfortunately is totally stifling an industry which has so much to offer to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lack of employment, development, and contribution which could and should be significant to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a world which is oil hungry and in which resources diplomacy is being used, not only is the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the world being debased but there is a very real threat of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot argue that this Bill concerns important issues so far as the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and an effect on inflation are concerned, and at the same time argue that this legislation concerns merely a matter of internal politics and the internal organisation of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters are important because they affect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the case of the trade union movement I suggest that it cannot be denied that it does have a significant influence on the community and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst totally agreeing, and I wish to emphasise this, on the importance of the essential role played by the trade union movement in the operation of the mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we enjoyed until the change of Government but which we now find is creating very considerable problems, I must say that it is about time that we as a community asked: What is the role of the trade union movement in Australia, how far does its proper role extend into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and into society, and are there structural changes which are desirable in relation to the unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether in a country which as part of the general world trend is moving towards big government, big unions, big corporationsin other words, a country in which so many institutions are becoming bigger and bigger in terms of power, size and the impact they have on the society as a whole and on the national as well as the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>- we are not going about it the wrong way by saying that we do not have to have regard to those developments and that if we amalgamate a few unions that is all we have to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something which will become more significant in its impact on every national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it not then be better for us to say that if we are to have the development towards bigger unions we should be thinking about a trend towards more industry oriented unions which will be able to play a part in balancing the power which is being continually exercised by the big corporations and by government interfering- we will not debate whether it is desirable or not- more and more in the affairs of industry and in the affairs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as the public interest is not served by large corporations or, for that matter, small corporations which ignore the rights of consumers, the interests of the environment, the interests of employees or the interests of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, so too there is ample evidence that the other major section of organised power outside the Government, that is the unions, is currently failing adequately to recognise the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: Just as the public interest is not served by corporations which ignore the interests of consumers, the environment, the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, employees and others, there is ample evidence that the trade unions, that other major section of organised power, are currently failing adequately to recognise the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have demonstrated a preparedness to act in relation to foreign affairs and environmental matters by imposing green bans and taking other action which has caused severe loss, suffering and inconvenience to the general public, has damaged the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and generally has not been of any particular advantage to individual members of the union concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is intended to play as part of a balancing of power within a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but rather because of the fact that inadequate attention has been paid by the community generally and by the larger section of those directly involved, in not standing back and conceptualising for a period of time and then seeing what system can be made to work in relation to what we want, not what we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If agreements are pursued in the light of the present inflationary situation, the members of the union and the public generally will be aware of what is involved in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and they will be aware of the situation which may arise by reaching an agreement in the circumstances  Senator Greenwood  has mentioned in which the normal increase is greater than can be justified before the Prices Justification Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrate to the Australian public that everything possible is genuinely being done to halt the grave damage being inflicted by inflation upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, by immediately and openly debating the aforesaid proposals of the Premier of Queensland, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it only serves to highlight and emphasise the wisdom of the Government’s decision of 18 months ago to revalue the dollar in order to arrest the inflationary trends which were already in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is assumed generally that the effect of the cuts will take some time to work through the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pertinent that we consider a number of things concerning an industry as great and as important to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worthy of mention that, contrary often to the general conception, the contribution which the Australian wheat growing industry has made to the consumption of wheat and its products in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, perhaps, one of the most significant areas of balance in the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia’s rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> is balanced our history shows that there is balance over the entire <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And while it is out spending its inflationary gains and storing up disaster for the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it moralises to the fictional man earning $70 a week, who has a non-working wife and 2 dependent children, that he will no longer have to pay any tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a good strong social conscience, and as our <span class="highlight">economy</span> has grown, as our nation has grown, so we have been able to give greater effect to our social conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the drive of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country- the real drive- is the small businessman, the small entrepreneur, and, of course, the farmer and the professional man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not matter whether the government of that country was a conservative government or a government of radical change, because what has been attacked in the Australian situation is symptomatic only of a general malaise in the whole world <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is symptomatic of the sort of problem which every country with a comparable <span class="highlight">economy</span> to that of Australia faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 23 years we lived in a country which was constantly described as a country with a stop-go <span class="highlight">economy</span>- a country which had recessions in 1961 and 1972, and in both cases unemployment was used deliberately as an economic weapon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That illustrates a point which we all have to face up to in considering the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in 1974, that is, that there are interests in Australian society which have a very great effect on the level of inflation and which have a responsibility, just as the Australian Government is constantly said by the Opposition to have a responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those interests are in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even though  Mr Snedden  has been constantly talking about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> since the May election, he so far has displayed little evidence that he has the intellectual and political toughness to take the decisions which the deteriorating situation demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the distinguished Melbourne political commentator,  Mr John  Curtain, said, packaging is in in terms of discussing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and discussing any matters which are the concern of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 23 years were marked by an utter lack of liaison between the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the business community, and both the Liberal Party of the time and the Labor Party, particularly in the latter years before this present Government assumed office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite frankly, as a member of the Goverment Party, that I think it is important that the Government encourage greater dialogue with the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Budget alone did not fulfil all his desires in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but that the Budget accompanied by devaluation would be a package which would go a long way to solving the economic management difficulties which we have incurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, if we remove the incentives to invest and profit, we will destroy the foundation of the growing <span class="highlight">economy</span> that can finance the sort of social program the electorate so clearly wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recently reported figures showing unemployment growing at 1,000 a day are a tragic reminder to the Government of the direction in which it is pushing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is matched by an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which differs from that of the eastern States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that expansion of government control is coupled with gross mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the reaction had to be even greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least they are prepared publicly to state their commitment to the destruction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the one hand and constitutional government on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also recognised that the provision of large amounts of bank finance to the Corporation would have meant a substantial reduction in the amount of such finance available to meet other essential needs in the rural and other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These included possible Government involvement in the Australian capital market and industrial structure arising from the proposed additional powers, extended functions and privileges of the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the implications for other financial institutions, in the money and capital market arising from the financing activities of the AIDC and the NIF; the consequent implications for resource use in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the attainment of other economic and social objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining industries of northern Australia are making a noteworthy and vitally important contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I have said, we have a Government which has completely abdicated its responsibility in regard to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not oppose that at all if taken at a sensible time, but taken at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a sick state and when inflation is increasing I believe that that sort of activity was irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> incentives should come from market prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to read about the numerous protest meetings around the countryside to realise how far offside is the Government with the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, during that time, no doubt due to the pressures that have been placed on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the costs that have been created by the Federal Labor Government, the estimated cost of this project has risen to no less than $600m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to encourage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to grow and to expand rather than enable it to be contracted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder we are in a mess, with such structural strains imposed on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are suffering most are the workers, the small businessmen and those people in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> who have been deprived of the advantages of a free enterprise government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that however parochial politicians and their economic advisers and critics may be, we live in an integrated world <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1950s and the 1960s, basically the United States <span class="highlight">economy</span> was characterised by approximate stability of prices; and this exercised a stabilising influence on world prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And the inflation tax has fallen on the whole world <span class="highlight">economy</span>, not merely the citizens of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any criticism has focussed on relatively minor aspects of the whole program for managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a very difficult period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was also stating that, in addition to it being an international problem, it was a problem associated with the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is still in pretty fair shapeliving standards are high, the level of employment is still (by any past standards) high, we still have our great natural resources, and we have largely escaped the consequences of the international oil crisis, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article goes on to say that  Mr Snedden  said that Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a mess- ‘The Leader of the Opposition made this point well last night’ said the economics writer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to refer in the few moments I have left to some of  Mr Snedden  ‘s infamous remarks on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during the period 1970 to 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see it as a critically important objective of our policy to combat the inflationary forces now running in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it is against this objective that I now come to explain the strategy of this Budget and our decision to raise additional revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we can keep our <span class="highlight">economy</span> buoyant by selling reasonable quantities of goods to Iran as a result of the Shah’s visit here last week, it will be another indication of the universal attitude of the Whitlam Government to diplomatic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have 27 Ministers and we have 27 authorities on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, all getting up and telling us how we should do things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was one of several persons who believed that at this time we ought not take a big stick to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was one who did not believe that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be thrashed to the point where many people, many groups of people and many companies would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believed that it was highly undesirable to use the methods that had been used in the past, to attack the <span class="highlight">economy</span> with draconic measures which would result in suffering not only for those who were guilty of exploitation and manipulation but also for those who were innocent of anything other than the desire to work hard and to apply themselves diligently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who supports the time honoured methods, which the Department of the Treasury has presented in the past, of a shake out in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a total restriction on credit and all sorts of measures which would make it difficult for people to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So the people’s small capital and effort were being used by the great manipulators within our <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that when the crash came those at the top were able to use the various devices to escape their obligations, to retire within the limitations of their companies and to survive the consequences of their act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, some of the things which we ourselves- the previous Government and this Government- have done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> have added to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His basic premise was that price competition has virtually disappeared from most sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and has certainly disappeared from what he calls the economic heartland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But regardless of the motive, the decision to stay the increase in ANL freight rates until the latest transport inquiry is completed is worth more to the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> than the cost to the ANL or the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It blames all the problems in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet we have a situation of people being out of work and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> being out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia has a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and we believe that there is a clear attack by this Government on the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the private sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the productive sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is during a period of Labor Government, during a period of his stewardship of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that he has allowed inflation to rip off, to use his words- to use the words of the Labor Party $ 1,000m from the value of the savings of little Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is however a need for all of us not to try to push ahead so fast that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is unable to meet our demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost in the form of a censure of a Budget which can do little or nothing other than tend to increase the widespread problems that face the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and Australian society today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should make sure that the necessary incentives and compensations are there to enable the total <span class="highlight">economy</span> to take advantage of that sort of market situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that our inflation is fundamentally due to the ineptitude of the Government in assessing what our own <span class="highlight">economy</span> can afford in governmental expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But there were forces latent in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> then which had to be watched carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Premier of that State has been criticising and pointing to the disabilities the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I desire to express my feelings and attitudes towards the overall question of the Budget, its effect on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, via the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, on the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At this time I stand in abject fear for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a classic case of the pea and thimble trick which is subversive to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing will destroy this <span class="highlight">economy</span> more quickly than lack of confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we make not apologies for the fact that when we came to office we believed that certain changes should be in this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support these increases in expenditure in the private sector because it is necessary to maintain a healthy private sector in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no connection between that advertisement and the contents of our Service Letter of August 1973, page 254, in which we advised dealers that to improve fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Torana LJ fitted with overhead cam engines, a rework of the cleaner assembly could be made, part of which was the removal of the restrictor’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This must be beneficial to our whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were very concerned with the implications to the Tasmanian trade and to the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much of Tasmania’s income and its <span class="highlight">economy</span> depends upon rural production and mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the way in which the Government has been handling the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- I do not say that it has been bungling the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because I believe that all that has happened has been carefully planned- it can be seen that it wants to restructure the way in which the country is run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That area makes a great contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It adds so much to costs generally and, therefore, if we have inefficient transportation we will have costs unnecessarily added to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is taking all necessary action to ensure that the secondary industries of this country are efficient and that they are maintained at their maximum level to the benefit of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Regrettably in this country the Federal Government is not armed with the powers to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite absurd that the Government does not have clear powers to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that honourable senators opposite should take up their present stand when they will recall that they bitterly opposed the constitutional referendum to enable this Parliament to have powers over incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is basic to the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, yet they took the stand that not even the Federal Parliament was to be entrusted with those constitutional powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the concern now being expressed about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the same Ministers, I ask: When did the Government first realise that spiralling inflation would lead Australia into economic chaos? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we introduce that kind of subsidy the industry, whatever it is, rearranges its <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that subsidy is necessary for its survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is taking the best advice available and the best measures that it can to reduce the effects of inflation and to cushion the <span class="highlight">economy</span> against the effects of the inflation which is manifesting itself elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the honourable senator should co-operate with the Government and allow it to introduce measures which will enable it to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> wisely, instead of continuing to engage in a process of obstruction to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is concerned and bearing in mind the question previously asked by  Senator Laucke,  can the Minister say what was the level of purchases of new motor vehicles in the September quarter compared with other quarters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is evident that in some respects, in any event, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is showing significant signs of responding to the initiatives of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that the way in which private enterprise, individuals and companies engaged in production in our type of <span class="highlight">economy</span> are to be subjected to the requirements of government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it is from the point of view of the development of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, whether it is from the point of view of the development of the citizen himself or whether it is from the point of view of the upbringing of children and their gradual enrolment in our society, one sees that the basis of the family unit is something which we in this Senate must uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrate to the Australian public that everything possible is genuinely being done to halt the grave damage being inflicted by inflation upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, by immediately and openly debating the aforesaid proposals of the Queensland Premier, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that the lending of money and the operations in the housing field are in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that despite all the current concerns about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, unemployment, resources and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, it should be noted that although no-one could deny the important contribution made to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by housewives and mothers, they have until now been excluded from any scheme of workers’ compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am advised that some excellent methods have been developed which deal with such crucial matters as staff and man-power development, operational effectiveness, internal administration and mechanisms to ensure budgetary realism with <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has made a great amount of liquidity available in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which previously was not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would be quite remiss of the Government now to allow injections of money which were unnecessary and unwarranted into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until 6 weeks ago the services were manned outside those hours, but with the introduction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures the period of operation of the services was reduced to 8 hours in order to save the payment of overtime and penalty rates and to cover the time when the majority of the public transport operations took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, when one compares our population with the populations of other trading nations, the trade that we have is an extremely important part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no great desire to enter into a lengthy debate on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as did  Senator Carrick  and  Senator Young,  but the comments which were made by both of them I think warrant taking a little of the time of the Senate to answer because if there is anything that distinguishes this Government from our predecessors it is the fact that we have believed - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that Government did was to allow this massive increase in the money flow in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strength of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> is reflected in figures such as those I have quoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to stress is that quite apart from the problems of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, Cabinet should give urgent and thorough consideration to how Australia as a leader can give help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is beset by the twin problems of rapid inflation and rising unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided, therefore, to provide a further demand stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed is a stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which increases demand whilst at the same time abating cost pressures and enhancing private profitability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The statement that I read last night on behalf of the Prime Minister indicated that the Government was fully conscious of the role of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Prime Minister’s statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> last night I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate if he can say why the State governments were overlooked and not given extra financial assistance, particularly as they have been forced to introduce new tax measures which are regarded both as bad politics and inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-One thing that ought to be clear to the honourable senator and that ought to be obvious from the questions that are asked and that are sometimes properly pointed in this direction is the effect of inflation upon the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present monopoly situation MacRobertson Miller Airline Services offers only one fare and TAA will offer first and <span class="highlight">economy</span> class with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> fares 20 per cent below current MMA fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a Liberal I am not too proud to recognise some of the things that have been done by the Government that are good although  99lh  per cent of the things it has done to this country have been disastrous and are tending to wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to wreck a country that Liberal-Country Party governments built up over a period of 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the appeal for wage restraint fails who will be to blame for further deterioration of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the unions or the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Prime Minister’s statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tuesday night and to the assumptions contained in that statement that the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decisions are of fundamental importance to the Government’s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I suggest that the Government could achieve its social objectives much better by supplementing the efforts of the private profession rather than by bureaucratic solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Attorney that there is no possibility that he could rival that sort of <span class="highlight">economy</span> in providing legal advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The matter we are discussing has been the subject of a considerable amount of public comment and adverse criticism at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a turbulent state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Act was changed because various people said that it should be changed and they brought in what was called cash <span class="highlight">economy</span> and then the people were not required to do this kind of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate my point let me refer to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which  Mr Whitlam  said, prior to May, was right and that we are on the up turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was getting to the point that  Mr Whitlam  told the people before May that everything was right with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find the industry repugnant, unnecessary, and benefits but a few people in this country, whereas live kangaroos in their natural habitat, through their value as tourist attractions are economically far more profitable to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to us aesthetically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not further a fact that had the Opposition’s full economic advice been taken as it was given many months ago the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> would not be in its current state of shock, growing inflation and lack of confidence, with the consequence of distressing and rising unemployment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it not a fact that New Zealand’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is tied markedly to overseas countries by its necessity to trade in primary products and in a more dependent way than Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, do not these facts demonstrate that the New Zealand Government can look after its <span class="highlight">economy</span> notwithstanding world conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a population difference between New Zealand and Australia; there are certain differences in trade of which we are aware and there have been changes in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Australia over the last few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps there have been changes in New Zealand ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span> also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also prepare a list of projects which are being promoted by the States and which are being frustrated by the Austraiian Government, thus damaging the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Minister to quote figures of first and <span class="highlight">economy</span> class fares, in view of his statement that he is discussing with the airlines the introduction of a one fare structure, is to say the least a phoney argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister said, under the present monopoly situation MMA offer only one fare but under the proposed competitive service TAA will offer first and <span class="highlight">economy</span> class fares, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> fare being 20 per cent below the current MMA fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The woman who stays at home and who contributes to the family and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the family through what we call home duties occupies an economic role far greater than that which is given official recognition through the laws of our land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In China there is a totally planned <span class="highlight">economy</span> with directions coming down as edicts from above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he hoped that the Prime Minister and the Australian Government would delay consideration of their welfare and social legislation until they got down to the job of legislating for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the welfare of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in conjunction - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite sincerely that one of the reasons why consideration of the Bill should be delayed is, as  Senator Everett  would know, that the  President  of the Labor Party in Tasmania,  Mr Lowe,  has said that he wants us to get on with legislating in order to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> out of the wallowing sea of despondency and despair in which it is at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was extraordinary to hear  Mr Lowe  ‘s statement on the news broadcast tonight because it was followed by the statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in which he said: ‘In spite of the serious state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’- he did not say ‘bother the unemployed’ or anything, but it was almost inferred ‘we will press on with our social legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then a new Federal Court structure would have to be created, with all the costs of buildings and staff which it necessarily would involve, which would raise real questions of <span class="highlight">economy</span> particularly at this stage of the nation ‘s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will you again entrust the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the men who deliberately, but needlessly, created Australia’s worst unemployment for 10 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>12, of October 1974, which states that indicators now point to a sharp contraction of the New Zealand <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the second half of 1974, that business confidence has been declining steadily in recent months and that signs of weakening in the labour market are apparent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard to realise or to believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> could have collapsed over the space of just a few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span> should not be compared with that of some countries with which we are being compared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indicators now point to a sharp contraction of the New Zealand <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the second half of 1974. . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Admirable though some of its social programs may be, they will have to be delayed until the growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> enables us to afford them without destroying the economic structure of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Can we afford another $A1m for a painting that is going to be called ‘House under Construction’ while the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to add the cost of inflation, which I believe has been a definite aim and objective of this Government to debauch the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>- which it is doing so successfullyit is clear that these will all have an effect on the rural people whom I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister for Agriculture continues to laugh on the front bench- as he does at the moment- he acknowledges that he has little sympathy for primary producers and little intelligence in the application of what should be done in the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember when we had the prices and incomes referendum some time ago this Government recognised the need for some sanity and control over these 2 important facets of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They realised that cost inflation is an essential part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a state of near disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these things add up to the general picture of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is basically healthy but which has the problem, like the economies of all other advanced countries, of increasing inflation and increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognised the vital importance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a healthy wool industry and it stepped in and provided $150m to shore up that industry in its time of very great difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being told here day after day that the reason the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a mess in this country is the obstruction of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Senate be said to have brought about unemployment, inflation and the wreckage of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have almost a wrecked <span class="highlight">economy</span>; they have raging inflation; and they have massive unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wriedt  spoke in such a way that I want to say that the wreckage that this Labor Government has caused in this country to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the raging inflation it has brought about and the massive unemployment, with lots more to come, has had nothing to do with the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was put into office it purposely set out to cause inflation and to wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The raging unemployment, the inflation that is running like fire through this country and the wrecked <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been caused by this Labor Government and not by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that you people, by your over-exaggeration of what is happening in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, have become the producers of the situation about which you warn us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not come into this place and over-exaggerate what is happening in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a shift in the direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time, in the building industry in particular, and the evidence of this will be seen in the next few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must recall that in 1961, when the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies had to impose more draconic measures than we are prepared to impose on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, signs went up in Queensland: ‘No labour wanted’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The causes of the present squeeze, as you term it- the credit restriction- were causes which you inflicted upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions which have affected the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time were made under your government, and  I  outlined those previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the situation which your Government created brought this <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the stage where it was impossible for a worker to afford to take 4 weeks’ annual leave because it costs more to take a week ?s leave than a worker receives in wages in your kind of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is sufficient money to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but the States are not able to use the money in the ordinary housing field, through the housing commissions, and Queensland certainly is not able to use it through the Aboriginal and Island Affairs Department, which is one area in which  Senator Bonner  is most interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building society interest rates are fixed by State governments which accept no responsibility for the overall national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson knows it well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be a strange commentary on the type of <span class="highlight">economy</span> which honourable senators opposite support that these huge building concerns which enter into land and building speculation, under the slightest pressure and restriction find themselves retreating into backruptcy or liquidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the latter part of the question, in the last year of the previous Government there was the greatest increase in the flow of money in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> we had seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 12 months prior to the change of government it was no less than 26 per cent which was an increase at a rate beyond all normal money flow increases and one with which this <span class="highlight">economy</span>, of course, like any other <span class="highlight">economy</span> would not be able to cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unemployment is a characteristic of the sort of <span class="highlight">economy</span> we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true, of course, that the Government is in absolute disarray in its <span class="highlight">economy</span> policies which come so thick and fast that it does not even know which one of its Ministers holds which portfolio at any one time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been added to by an extremely high rate of industrial unrest, causing at this crucial time a falling away of goods and services and indeed it has been aided and abetted by the attempted transfer of funds from the private to the public sector in this <span class="highlight">economy</span>- a transfer which fortunately in this circumstance has been recognised as unfortunate, as probably the wrong economic measure, and has been at least in some degree arrested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the unemployment figures confirmed the restoration of confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the implementation by the Government of its promises of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is an area where the Government has an opportunity to provide more finance so that people who have been unemployed as a result of the Government’s mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Taking into account the part wool plays in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> will the Minister advise what action the Government will take to ensure that the public can buy a range of woollen goods in Australia at a reasonable price? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it starts to accept reality and to accept that the Australian Government, judged by world standards, is managing this <span class="highlight">economy</span> very well it may start the very long process of coming back into public acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rainfall is the major limitation to agricultural production in the area and supplementary irrigation would secure the efficient production of a large range of crops, thereby considerably enhancing the flexibility of the agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision was inserted really for the sake of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to which  Senator Greenwood  drew our attention earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be pleased to abandon the notions of convenience and <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and to abandon the sub-clause if he indicates that that is still his wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Leader ofthe Government explain why the Ministers responsible for the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and for restoring employment, and he as leader of the Government in this chamber, are allowing the Prime Minister to engage in a scandalously expensive holiday jaunt at the taxpayers’ expense? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we would not have let the <span class="highlight">economy</span> get into the situation it is in now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is something which ought to be regarded as an essential part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An outstanding feature of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> since World War II- over all the years of the Liberal-Country Party Government- is the great improvements and the great strides which were made by manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its large development over those years has been a major factor in the strength of the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> and manufacturing industry is now contributing in a very outstanding way to our standing in the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to our balance of payments and to our economic strength generally as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, therefore, as the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> becomes more sophisticated and even more industrialised and as it hopefully will grow, that the manufacturing industry as an exporter and as an earner of overseas exchange will become even more important and will be of steadily growing importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think events are proving that the Government’s intention and the action that it has taken to improve and expand the imports into this country, despite the fact that they have brought about some difficulties in certain areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, nevertheless are providing the goods which an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is booming along needs; and the demand in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> still remains very strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that it can only be of benefit to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly to our trading position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed scheme was announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the House on 12 November 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued by the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Government that, if wage indexation is accepted by the union movement and the employers and is supported by the Government, it will go a long way to easing many of the pressures that are currently being placed on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was intended to apply to people who might be able to increase their work capabilities and fit into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in particular job classifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the present number of strikes are crippling the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and jeopardising the jobs of many thousands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it true to say that the traditional optimism amongst Australian industrialists and businessmen and even the man in the street has been jolted by a sharp downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Prime Minister will consult his economic advisers and the incoming Treasurer from time to time and they will be issuing statements on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and also making the encouraging statements which were requested by  Senator Drake-Brockman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As stated by me in this place and by  Mr Cameron  elsewhere, the Department has forecast fairly accurately the developments in unemployment which have occurred and which we, as a Government, say are characteristic of the mixed western <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is included in the Bill to require a judicial manager, appointed by the Court, to conduct the affairs of the fund with the greatest <span class="highlight">economy</span> consistent with efficiency and to report to the Court, as soon as possible, as to the course of action to be taken in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an <span class="highlight">economy</span> where home building is overwhelmingly the function of private enterprise, the Commonwealth, although it may indirectly influence the level of home building, is not in a position to make overall plans to ensure that they will be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A massive taxation cut, opening the flood doors to overseas funds and foreign domination of our resources, together with some enormous unjustifiable increases in Government expenditure, would be disastrous for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in respect of the Budgets, the finances and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country has proved the ineptitude of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, he is being ditched, sent down, because of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon after his removal from the office of Treasurer was announced the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was attacking Treasury officials because he implied that they were either late in providing or kept from him important information regarding the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was any truth in that the Prime Minister had plenty of time to make inquiries about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because throughout the election campaign before 18 May he was continually told about the need to reduce taxation and that the fight was about inflation, but he would not listen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He now finds that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a mess prior to his leaving us on an overseas trip for 5 weeks without having to face the music from the many unemployed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be argued that a potential investor will decline to invest in one specific area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because he is going to pay a penalty rate of taxation in that area and therefore will invest somewhere else because in this instance there is no escape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently there is no danger and there is no way in which there could be a flight of capital from any particular sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were then discussing Bills and a number of senators, including  Senator Greenwood,  used the first reading stage of the Bills to expand on their political analyses of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is it true of the Country Party in relation to the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; it is equally true of the Liberal Party in relation to the business community and that Party’s attempts to undermine the confidence of the business community, as it has been doing in this place over a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the argument to support the suggestion that this Government is not fully mindful of the need for a private sector in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was brought on, of course, because of the mismanagement of the money flow in this <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last year of Liberal-Country Party rule, when that Government allowed a massive increase in the amount of money coming into this country without any restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that subsequent to this decision, the proprietors of the Sydney ‘Sun’ and the Daily Mirror’, apparently acting in collusion, have begun an <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive and have reduced the number of editions previously printed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that as a result of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive, reputed to save $5,000 a week, country people now receive the cable edition which is largely a re-hash of the morning papers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the very many statements made in the Senate by the Attorney-General during the September quarter in which he claimed that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at that time was sound, robust and healthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the official figures for the period have totally discredited all the Minister’s statements on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will the Minister admit his serious misleading of the Australian people and refrain in future from such grossly erroneous comments and predictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is trying to spread gloom and despair in the community whereas he ought to be saying that the Government is taking action that is designed to improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He ought to be encouraging the people of Australia, in accordance with what  Senator Drake-Brockman  said, to have some confidence, to fit in with the Government’s plans, to get together and start to make the <span class="highlight">economy</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financial situation in this country has become serious as a result of the actions of this Government.- There is raging inflation, massive unemployment and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a real mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What staggers me and frightens me is that I read the other day that  Mr Whitlam  is going to take a stronger hand in the control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is to take a stronger hand in the running of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, it makes one wonder what could happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee of which I was a member ran into a lot of trouble in regard to the huge capital investment, or apparent huge capital investment, of the primary industry sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that speech the Treasurer made some remarks and references to the standards of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the things that make an <span class="highlight">economy</span> work, and those remarks are a truly significant background against which to judge some of the taxation measures that we are looking at in the Senate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we read the extremely accurate economic assessment of the Honourable Frank Crean we must wonder whether the accuracy of his economic attitude and his knowledge of economic theory and of the things that make an <span class="highlight">economy</span> work could be the reason that he is unfortunately very shortly to cease to be the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me to indicate his recognition of the basic economic theory that is needed for an <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as ours to survive and develop and, indeed, for it to recover from the disastrous circumstances in which it finds itself today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed also to reveal to me that whilst the Federal Treasurer had indicated a very fine concern for the realities of economic theory in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, this concern was to be contrasted against that of the incoming Treasurer who may be more concerned, as I believe much of the taxation material is concerned, with matters which are basically ideological rather than economic and social. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant indeed that the Treasurer should have made such a statement, for we are constantly being reminded that the inflationary tragedy in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a world wide disease, and the presumption is that it is contagious and that in Australia ‘s case it is an imported situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we are witnessing what is virtually an ideological operation in which a cake is being cut into different sized pieces instead of attention being given to the matter that needs the entire and total attention of this <span class="highlight">economy</span>, of this society, and I refer to the matter of increasing the size of that cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those objectives are most attractive, but they cannot be realised unless we create through our economic policies the sort of incentive that is necessary to increase the productive capacity of this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is regrettably an enormous amount of uncertainty in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today, and this of itself is destructive to the area of production and employment with which we must all be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone will accept that a normal measure of risk taking is the proper and natural province of a free enterprise society, but I am sure that everyone will agree that the sort of inflationary risk taking with which the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is faced today is most definitely incapable of being solved by the best managerial skills here or anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be instilled into this <span class="highlight">economy</span>- I suggest that one of the most important ways that this sort of thing can be instilled into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is through taxation measures- a confidence and a determination to increase productivity across the board; in other words, to increase the size of the national cake instead of spending our energies on dividing it in different ways and leaving its size the same perhaps as it was or even smaller. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so- I certainly hope it is so- then why present the September Budget, the one that preceded it and the one that followed it, all within 6 months,  and all with taxation measures that have lent literally nothing to the incentive capacity within this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can only help to stop the amassing of investment which brings about a great increase in employment and productivity at a time probably when this <span class="highlight">economy</span> has never needed it more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another anti-move in a society and in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that deserves and must have circumstances that bring a real incentive to bear on our operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could go on but, as I support the amendment moved by  Senator Carrick,  I choose to say in closing my remarks that the tragedy of the Bills we have been discussing is that they are totally designed- I regret to say designed but I assume that is the correct word-to deny incentive at a time when this <span class="highlight">economy</span> and this society needs nothing more and certainly nothing more urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the wool industry may not be as important to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our overseas funds as it was in past years it is probably still the major contributor, taken over a period of years, of all industries to our overseas funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because 95 per cent of our wool is sold overseas and only 5 per cent of it at the most is used locally the industry has always been in a position in which it has been dependent upon the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the purchasing countries and has always been in difficulty in Australia because of the high cost structure at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, where the Government judges it necessary to facilitate a structural change arising from a decision in the broad national interest, but beyond the normal adaptive capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there is another reason for providing assistance to changes of this sort, and one that is particularly important to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s program over a wide range of activities has been of an inflationary character which has increased during the past 12 months at a rate well in excess of every comparable country and <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This clearly indicates that, being basically a rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, New Zealand recognises that there is a need for support within the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the industry benefit but the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole will benefit, in particular in the depressed areas in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, where a great deal could have been done in the past had there been a more intelligent- I deliberately use the word ‘intelligent’- direction of such moneys into the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say in very brief terms that the whole of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> will fall to pieces unless the Government can come to grips with the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall  made the point, I believe quite correctly, that cost inflation is now the main problem in this <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as well as the fact that we do not have control over our incomes and our prices- a control which this Government foresaw 12 months ago was a necessary ingredient of its powers if it was going to control a cost inflation situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the Government intends to attempt to proceed with this scheme shows how hollow are its claims to be worried about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were worried about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> it certainly would not be going ahead with this scheme and certainly would not be going ahead with it at this time. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my opinion this scheme will further damage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the legislation that we are putting through tonight- at least I hope we will be putting it through the Senate- we will see a strengthened wool industry in the future in this country, an industry which will continue to play a major role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia and in particular in our export earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We made an example of a small section of the community, but we made people in high office with great responsibility, if I may use the expression, the guinea pigs of salary rises in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that looked to be going the wrong way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on 12 November last, I pointed out that the problems of the rapid rise in unemployment and continuing steep rise in prices and costs are interlocked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the brief space of a couple of months we have witnessed the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> pass into an acute recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We made it quite clear that we intended to expand Government spending in certain areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Government’s belated recognition that unemployment in excess of 3 1 1 000 will not be materially reduced until confidence and co-operative industrial relations have been restored in the private sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I ask: What is the Government’s present position with regard to the future operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I left Europe with the feeling that despite our temporary difficulties Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is healthier and basically sounder than those of most of the countries I visited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I left Europe with the sure knowledge that the management of the Western monetary system and the Western <span class="highlight">economy</span> is, along with the maintenance of peace, the greatest and most immediate problem of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am unable to answer the broad question as to the overall impact on costs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic fact is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country in relation to the economies of other countries remains strong and the prospects remain good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Federal Government measures to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are failing to create new jobs- employment opportunities are still disappearing at a fast rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is obviously massive unemployment and this massive unemployment is the result of Government policies which have destroyed confidence in the business sector, confidence which is absolutely essential if our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to secure and provide the employment which is so vitally necessary for Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, and I think the record evidences it quite clearly, that these current expressions, indications of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are the direct consequence of Government policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a gross mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because it is fair to describe the situation in Australia as mismanagement if a state of virtually full employment and of moderating inflation at the end of 1972 leaps into annual rates of inflation of approximately 1 5 per cent and unemployment of a level the highest it has been for approximately 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The depressed circumstances of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were expressly stated by the then Treasurer, the present Minister for Overseas Trade  (Mr Crean)  to be the opportunity for the transfer from the private sector to the public sector of resources which were then regarded as being available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I repeat, as part of a deliberate policy pursued by this Government the private sector of this country has been unable to fulfil that role which traditionally it has fulfilled in securing employment, investment, growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and all that is dependent upon growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will you again entrust the government of the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the men who deliberately but needlessly created Australia’s worst unemployment for 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We of the Opposition believe that the Government ‘s destruction of business confidence and business initiative has been the vital factor in the downturn of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the world climate is affecting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facts are that if anybody looks at the world situation he will find that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Australian standard of living and the Australian standard of social services are much higher than those in most of the developed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 members of the Parties sitting opposite set in train a downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by rejecting the advice of the Department of Labor and National Service, as it then was, which advised the Treasurer- this was stated by  Mr Clyde  Cameron- that there ought to be an expansionary policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are sending back large numbers of casual and seasonal workers which they have always needed to improve their <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to keep their industries going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They knew less about how to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than this Government does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet that is what  Mr Snedden  did when he grovelled in New York and apologised for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall quote an excerpt which is headed ‘The Domestic <span class="highlight">Economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document also emphasises the value of the private sector in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and how it is the private sector- individuals and companies, as the document states- that can best develop our natural resources and employ our work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A common blind’ spot displayed by all Opposition speakers, with the marginal exception of  Senator Hall,  was their prediction that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> could be considered in isolation from the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last quarter of 1972 the money supply exploded at an annual rate of 30 per cent when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was already approaching a level of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were more strikes of a nature damaging to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than we had had at any previous period of our history, so much so that the Government completely reversed the attitude of encouragement and demand that it had adopted when it first took office, and we had even Labor Ministers turning to the unions and almost pleading for moderation and restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a year like 1975 the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot possibly pay general wage increases of 20 per cent and more without most of them going quickly into prices and this means more inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has evolved into a general discussion on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> although the motion really centred on unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was back in 196 1 that we saw the last severe credit squeeze imposed on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the then Menzies Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conditions were different to the extent that at no time in the history of this country had there been such a flood of money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as occurred in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that enormous inflow of money which this Government inherited from its predecessors stemmed the main problem facing the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the past 12 or 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that had those actions not been taken the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> would have experienced infinitely greater stresses, especially during 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the management consultant firm of W. D. Scott and Co. Ply Ltd, a company which puts out regular bulletins on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, makes the interesting point in the form of a graph showing the changing structure of unemployment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have taken all reasonable steps within our power to get the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving at a faster rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is moving back into top gear more quickly than most people realise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not based on fact but on an emotional political point, recognising the difficulties which do exist in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and which this Government is taking all possible steps to rectify, lt would not be in the interests of the Senate or of the Parliament if this motion were to be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt said that at the time of their taking government, conditions were exceptional in terms of the amount of inflow of funds into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A budget had been introduced towards the end of 1972 which was meant to boost the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time there were comments that if it were to continue in this vein it would be running a very real risk with the fabric of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 23 years we managed to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> relatively stable and growing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have learnt to their cost that it takes a great deal of hard work and effort and very wise policies to keep the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> stable and steadily growing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The formulas have not been looking forward and have not been providing for any form of dynamic growth and any reflection of the dynamic growth which has been occurring in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over those years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen yesterday’s Melbourne ‘Age ‘ in which there appeared an article by Kenneth Davidson, the economics editor of that paper, which referred to the simple minded belief that a cut in Government spending would be of benefit to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the present economic circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Darwin is inflated specifically because of the special demands which are made by its reconstruction it will be very difficult in the future to contain costs and bring them back to normalcy with those in the rest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest it would not be unfair and would be the best way to create a resurgence of business there without over-inflating the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> above that of the rest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the matter which  Senator Grimes  raises may seem perhaps unimportant in the general context of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is certainly something which is very serious for those people who can be placed in a difficult position on finding that they have been overpaid while receiving only a modest income from their pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is because these services can be provided on a scale and we have the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of scale which, in many instances, I believe leads to a saving of 25 per cent of the cost of carrying out those services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It desires to remould society and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, not merely to redistribute wealth among Australians where they are but to guide investment towards the development of the country as a whole, to rationalise and modernise industry and community services so as to provide all Australians with more value for their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Industry Development Corporation is currently bound to source its borrowings principally outside Australia regardless of whether this is good or bad for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In summary, the measures contained in these Bills, now before the Parliament in unchanged form for the second time, will create the means for AIDC, or the Government through AIDC, to help provide the financial requirements of the private sector in industry development of importance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towards the end of a reply to me this morning about a question concerning the present slump in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>,  Senator James  McClelland intimated that the tone of my voice indicated that I hoped unemployment might continue to increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those feelings have brought that about and, as a result, we have seen a severe loss in the overseas earning capacity of this country, once again highlighting the dangers to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently we became aware in this industry of the ripping away forthwith of taxation deductions and of various other incentives which were important because they were basic to the establishment of an industry with an immense capacity and an exciting future in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that there is a need for an immense amount of co-operation if this great industry is to get on its feet again and contribute all that it can add to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and society of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a magnificent achievement of extreme importance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would affect the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a most undesirable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will obtain the information for the honourable senator, as he is interested in exposing the role of multinationals in Australian society, and provide it to him so that he can continue his national campaign against the influence of multinationals in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is fully aware of this problem and has taken a series of steps, which I have detailed on several occasions, to stimulate the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of that each union today is in competition and all of the resulting problems are reflected in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications are that the Government’s last budgetary proposals lack validity because  Mr Whitlam  said in November of last year that he believed that wage indexation would be introduced and that when it was introduced there would be an opportunity for confidence to be restored and for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to turn the corner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These included possible Government involvement in the Australian capital market and industrial structure arising from the proposed additional powers, extended functions and privileges of the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the implications for other financial institutions in the money and capital market arising from the financing activities of the AIDC and the NIF; the consequent implications for resource use in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the attainment of other economic and social objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Industry Development Corporation must have access, as must have any other corporation which is attempting to play a role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to Australian funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the AIDC, a fully owned government arm and the Australian Resources Development Bank, a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> owned arm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great deal to be said in situations like this in modern society for the duopoly approach in which the government arm is operating and a private enterprise market <span class="highlight">economy</span> arm is operating, as long as certain things are consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking ahead to a case that may arise, if the Parliament decides that that is the wise and proper thing to do, I see no reason why that opportunity should not be offered to a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> operator with the same kind of subsidies as obviously will be payable to the AIDC to undertake such work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the position of the other operator, the ARDB which is fully f unded by the market <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we find that it made a profit of $1,700,000 on its capital reserves of $835,100,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a government operation making 1 1 per cent on its capital reserves and a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> arm doing much the same sort of thing and making 1 8 per cent on its capital reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would agree in part with what he said provided he were to carry that over into the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but he has not done that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to repeat unduly what I have raised on other occasions, but let us think in terms of the tremendous assistance- to some advantage, admittedly, to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> but at a tremendous price to the Australian communitygiven in the form of the funding of companies which were prepared to engage in exploration for and, if successful exploration were pursued, exploitation of the mineral resources so explored for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the way in which I followed his argument it seemed to me that on the one hand he was trying to say that Australians should have an interest in their own <span class="highlight">economy</span>, natural resources and secondary industry and that on the other he talked about the importance of overseas finance and foreign investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government realises the need for this strong sector in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years, particularly in 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule, we saw the activities of all these organisations expanded because the government of the day, I think, recognised the value of them to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in these comparisons we can see a movement towards what is accepted now in this country as a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thrust of the policies of any Australian government should be to ensure that these 2 sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can work together for the mutual benefit of both and to the benefit of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is included in the Bill to require a judicial manager, appointed by the court, to conduct the affairs of the fund with the greatest <span class="highlight">economy</span> compatible with efficiency and to report to the court, as soon as possible, as to the course of action to be taken in relation to the fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot accept that another country can enter the Australian market, can take what it wants and cannot be expected to have conditions placed on it as to what else it buys as part of an overall package in a mixed bag <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the basis of the whole erosion of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said on a number of occasions, I think the Labor Government has been very successful in debauching the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally when we get this increase in liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we must expect an increase in inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this Government is endangering Australia, its currency and its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I undertook to obtain further details in answer to the latter part of a question from  Senator Greenwood  in the Senate on 4 March about whether the Government, as an elementary exercise in protecting an Australian’s human rights, would refuse to hold the projected talks with the Pathet Lao Minister for the <span class="highlight">Economy</span>, who is about to visit Australia, until the Pathet Lao have given satisfactory assurances about the welfare and future of  Mr Sharman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from the interim period providing circumstances which would justify an acceptance of the determinations today, the interim period has provided circumstances that show that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> has become critically worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was notified last year that there would be an inquiry for the first time since I have been in this Parliament, I thought it my duty, in the view of the absolutely menacing circumstances in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to submit a deliberate proposition to the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without exaggeration that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> now faces a highly dangerous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not think it possible that anyone, in view of the calamitous deterioration that has taken place in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> since, could contemplate the acceptance of that which was rejected last July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who cannot see the significance of springing this increase of 37 per cent for members of Parliament into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> today has to look only at what it has already engendered in the State field and in this important field of Qantas pilots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applauds the move that I am making in the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is, as  Senator Wright  has put forward, a very serious time in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the state of the Government why do you think the Opposition popularity rating has fallen 7 per cent and why do you think your own popularity rating as a leader has fallen 4 or S per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I qualify those remarks by saying that in the beginning the Government established the case that there was, as well there may have been, too much foreign capital flowing into our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the honourable senator has asked me that question, I point out that  Mr Anthony  once made the hypothetical suggestion that if the price of crude oil at the wellhead were increased by 40 per cent it would involve the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in an increase in the price of petrol of 2c or 3c a gallon and that that could be avoided by a reduction in the excise duty on that petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question that inevitably arises is: If these increases in expenditure were not made, what section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be disadvantaged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons for the overall increase in traffic include growth in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>; the realisation by many shippers of the advantages of rail, especially forwarding agents, and their consequent diversion of freight from other modes to rail; and the increased operating efficiency of Australia’s railways resulting from improved rolling stock and rail standardisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the declining market, which was brought about by the depressed <span class="highlight">economy</span> induced by this Government, people were not buying motor cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-57-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we get a state of certainty in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> where people know where they are going, until we get a growing <span class="highlight">economy</span> and not a declining <span class="highlight">economy</span> and until we get a state in which people are able to invest and generate enough profitability to pay the loans involved, it is unlikely that we will get much investment revival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-57-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a country that has a balanced, mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-57-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of a static <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Australian passenger vehicle industry volume remained fairly constant from 1970 to 1972, at about 400 000 vehicles a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-57-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is, of course, a capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span> and as far as the Opposition is concerned we want to retain Australia as a capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effectiveness of and the confidence which people have in the capital market is vital to the stability and productiveness of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, need it be said, to the continuation of employment opportunities in our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be possible to exclude them hereafter from taking part in the affairs of those companies and the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> might be disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been revealed by the Committee’s inquiries illustrates without any doubt that the economic history of a country is determined not only by what can be narrowly looked at as economic activity- that is, the conduct of industry, the building of factories, the discovery and mining of minerals, the selling of goods and services- but also and almost equally importantly in the type of capitalist system or mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which we live, by the trading of shares in public companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, many of the distortions which occurred in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, many of the problems with which we were faced, with which we are still faced and with which other countries have been faced, have not resulted from any substantial weakness in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the sense of a lack of raw materials, a lack of industry; they have resulted from imperfections in the means whereby the ownership of public companies, the trading of shares in public companies, the financing of public companies, takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was found to be so most glaringly in the United States at the height of the Great Depression when  President  Roosevelt’s Administration, after its election in 1932, determined that at least part- certainly not all but at least part and a significant part- of the great distress which had afflicted the United States during the Great Depression had been caused not by problems in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in the narrow sense of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but by malpractices, defects in the stock exchanges of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still many great imperfections in the American <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that whatever the report of the Committee may say and whatever recommendations the Committee may or may not make the revelations which were made because of the Committee ‘s activity in themselves were of very great importance to the Australian people in understanding just how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of their country has been managed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this plan require the support of a developed <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as that of Australia, Canada or South Africa for its success? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other activities of the Services are not similarly involved; however there is a continuing requirement within the Services to exercise <span class="highlight">economy</span> in carrying out their functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a glance at the financial result of the operation of government railways in Australia proves that this aspect of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs to be given much attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is a ridiculous state of company legislation for the modern complex <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we have in 1975 as contrasted with the incipient industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span> for which the original Act of 1862, which provided that legislation, was appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The job we all have in this Parliament or in the Senate is to make the capitalist side of our mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> operate, to make it work, and to make it likely to serve the purpose that we all believe it should serve in our type of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact of economic life that the strength of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a free enterprise society will parallel the health and vigour of its securities markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as is well known, there have been numerous instances of the securities market being turned into something more akin to a casino than to a system of capital formation for the benefit of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a country’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a boom has happened in the past, and the circumstances that could make such a boom happen in the future are still possible, particularly if certain political events take place to make the <span class="highlight">economy</span> a little more free than it has been of late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it extremely unfortunate that we do not have before us at the same time a companies Bill because, to determine how adequately the Bill before us will deal with the needs of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our people over the ensuing period towards the end of this century, we need to know what will be the appropriate companies law with which this Bill will be in harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It said it was satisfied that the interests of this nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, growth and welfare, as well as the interests of all those persons and corporations, both within and without Australia, who are involved in the securities industry require that the Commonwealth Government exercise the powers given to it at Federation to legislate with respect to the securities industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall attempt to remember what they were, lt is true that the Treasurer has made a statement to the effect that the Government does not intend to restrict the flow of money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the point where it will dampen down the expanding employment that is taking place now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, he referred to Treasury bulletin number 69 of 1973 which, he said, pointed out that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> became swamped with money early in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder why the <span class="highlight">economy</span> became swamped with money early in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He argued therefrom that of course the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the Government’s responsibility for the next 2 years and not the responsibility of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government agree that much of the unemployment in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is due to the Government’s action in attempting to transfer resources too rapidly from the private sector to the Government sector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we will be debating the Appropriation Bills later today, that will be an excellent opportunity for  Senator Townley  to give us a discourse on the effect of the so-called transfer of our resources from the private to the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that if the Government wants to use and rattle round again that old chestnut that we injected too much money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, why did not the Government pipe it out in its 1973-74 Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if we add to the figure of $120,000 an amount which will bring it up to a realistic figure of requirement, having regard to the inflationary content of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that figure should be $ 1 50,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this situation it is crucial we realise that in this <span class="highlight">economy</span> there is no capacity for the people to absorb still higher rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present circumstances in the Australian industry, which basically are outside the control of the Government or the industry, must be overcome because no one would suggest that the industry does not have a real and profitable future for itself as an industry, and for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> as an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is just as well for the Australian primary producing <span class="highlight">economy</span> that that is a fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear that in these circumstances, as we are discussing appropriation and expenditure, it is important that we should look at the real circumstances of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we find around us, and I urge the Government to take particular notice of the areas to which I have referred, as they are among the most basic areas in this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly Opposition members would have to concede that in the same period, in 1 97 1 -72, in which they had responsibility for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country they permitted an inflow of capital from overseas of more than $3,300m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course we are confronted with a position in a socalled free enterprise society in which a government has very limited powers and opportunities to control the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an incredible state of affairs that the senators from the parties opposite should take the view that all we have to do to right the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which the Australian Government has very little power to determine because of the free enterprise philosophy that exists within this country, is for the Australian Government to reduce its expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we increase the money supply, unless a great deal of restraint is exercised in this field, clearly the <span class="highlight">economy</span> again will get out of focus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The price at which superphosphate will be offering for the next six or twelve months or even 2 years, together with the predicament in the general level of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will mean that the demand for phosphate will be low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If money is spent to produce and create the resources by which farmers can grow products, what is achieved is an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which money is being put to service as distinct from this situation where artificial employment is simply being promoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can any Government justify a surrender of the power to control its railways as Tasmania has done when, if there is any justice in the country on the financial basis upon which States should be supported, this Commonwealth Government is bound to render financial assistance to Tasmania to enable it to run the railway services it thinks sufficient so that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of those railways is not too much out of line with other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>comment that because the price of phosphate rock was rising the Government should step in and subsidise away this price increase, I commend to  Senator Wright  a study of chapter 5, paragraph 46 of the Green Paper ‘Rural Policy in Australia’ in order that he may attain a better understanding of the market free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> which I presume, as a Liberal Party senator, he espouses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to take the slightly different view that the importance that we should attach to assessing the need for explanation of this $240m is an importance related to the manner in which the expenditure is to be made and to the way in which it is to affect an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is already in dire straits, already suffering unemployment at a significant level- and increasing- and inflation at a similar level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that we have to have schemes such as the RED scheme is a measure, I confess, of the fact that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in difficulties; but I do not see any reason to apologise for the RED scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With food prices continuing to rise, thus increasing the pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, can the Minister confirm that the Government has reversed its stand against cuts in public sector spending? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If significant reductions are to be made, will the Government announce its intentions before the presentation of the Budget, to help allay fears that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is running out of control? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be clear from these provisions that the Government expects the new Commission to provide an efficient and responsive service to its clients as well as to give effect to such important objectives as <span class="highlight">economy</span> in purchasing and the development of purchasing methods which will result in obtaining the best value for the taxpayers’ money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Immediately anything in any area of a nation ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span> shuts itself off from those other parts that contribute to that <span class="highlight">economy</span> there tends to arise a measure of suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me somewhat of a shame that this sort of educational project, important as it is, cannot become part of the wider educational field in the Australian circumstance because I believe immense value is to be gained, as a nation and as a people, from providing facilities which enable students in whatever faculty they may be interested and in whatever area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> they may be involved to mix and to gain from mixing, from discussion and from the thoughts of students who may be applying themselves to any of a dozen or a score of other faculties or other lines of occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we are genuinely interested in the development of this Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, this Australian society, we should be devoting our attention in some measure, through this Authority, to the question of efficiency or to the question of economics itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is terribly important that the contribution of this training authority should be such that it will tend in the long term to increase not only the productivity of the community but also the understanding of every segment of the community of the way in which our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our society operate to the community’s best advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without wishing to disagree with his comment that an over-emphasis on productivity has accelerated the accident rate, I think in practical terms it must be recognised that demands in excess of productivity and not related to technological advancement or improvement in economic return must result in the inflation which we have seen rising at a rapid rate in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the very great difficulties which we are experiencing as a manufacturing nation at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And in recent years, and in particular in the last S years, they have exhausted or beaten down any opposition and have finally succeeded in making themselves the arbiters of the British <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that anyone reading in the Press of the difficulties of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Britain would not deny the simple statement that that is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With union leaders asking for wage increases, immediately, of up to 70 per cent, and deaf to threats or entreaties, the magnitude of the inflation involved is outside the experience of anyone in Britain, or indeed anyone in a modern industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that I have probably used a sledge hammer to crack a nut, but I think I have in fact proved the point that the objectives of trade unions as translated into practical terms in Britain are simply to hold the British <span class="highlight">economy</span> to ransom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can look at the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general and we can say that the personnel of the union movement should know more about economics, as management should know more about economics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are looking at this Bill and thinking that out of it will come the cure-all and a recognition of all the economic realities in this community and that within 10 years or whatever time we like to put upon it we will have a sane and sensible union approach to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to its management and to the acceptance of government decisions, we will be sadly mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition senators believe that if they can come into the chamber, particularly when the proceedings are being broadcast, and bash the trade union movement and blame the trade union movement for everything that is affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia irrespective of what Bill we are debating, they are serving their masters, and they hope to be rewarded for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In setting up the Committee under Professor Crisp which led to this report it was pointed out in the background to the inquiry- the Crisp Committee brought this forward in its report- that it was important for the quality and consistency of both Government and parliamentary decisions, as well as for the community’s capacity to evaluate such things as official data systems particularly in closely interrelated areas of social policy and economic policy, that they be mutually compatible and above all that they reflect what I think we can describe as the dynamic needs of the Australian community, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Immediately there was a suggestion of a recession in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> people stopped building and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission acknowledged this situation by granting a wage loading for lost time and saying that it is one of the industries that must have a reservoir of labour in order to function efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A study of the investment policies of some companies would reveal that if they had made more funds available to the private sector of manufacturing, instead of concentration in real estate, then the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would have been better served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As income to the AGIC from these areas of activity is generated more quickly and in larger proportions than from some other classes of insurance, the flow of such income into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will benefit all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was recognised at a very early stage of the negotiations on the transfer that because of the important role the railways play in the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> there would need to be provision in any agreement for the State to have some influence over the future operations of the railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the Opposition may justify the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because it is in line with the rest of the improvements in the Bill, it involves an emotional response which might very well divert the argument from the general proposition which the Opposition is putting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary however to totally oppose the changes now proposed, because if adopted they will generate a further serious cost explosion in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> already racked by costpush inflation, lt is no exaggeration to say that many business undertakings will not be able to bear the additional costs when equivalent benefits or something near to them flow through to the private sector, as they inevitably must, lt must also be understood that most companies already are under strain in endeavouring to accommodate their existing pension schemes to the effects of inflation in the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Cairns  has been quite right in pointing out that it is the inherent contradiction within the free enterprise society itself that creates the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, not the result of Government activity or Government legislation, but in fact the same contradictions as exist in all the developed countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to remind  Senator Marriott,  who is interjecting and who ought to remember, apropos of the question that was asked earlier of  Senator James  McClelland, that this Government was the first Australian Government to give substantial help to the freights shipping services to Tasmania, the most important element in the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania is a particularly fragile one due, primarily, to the neglect of the interests of that State during 23 years of misrule by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the concern which I have but it does not depart from the principal area of the Opposition’s concern, which is that at a time of massively escalating Australian public expenditure and the conferring of increasing benefits on public servants in so many ways, this is the time to call a halt until the <span class="highlight">economy</span> settles down and things begin to reassert themselves in a form of stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has enormous implications, not simply for the position on the waterfront but also for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> because what is being sought by this Bill, very shortly expressed, is the authority to increase the charges, which are levied by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority on the employers of waterside labour, by  67  per cent in the Class A ports,  100  per cent in the Class B ports and  108  per cent in the Class C ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The impact which these costs on the waterfront must have had and must be continuing to have on the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot be underestimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a situation which has got to be looked at because of the seriousness of a continuing position where the cost of imports, which have ramifications right throughout the production area in which the imports play their part, will undoubtedly increase costs and consequently prices throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say a brief word about the personnel of the Interim Committee on the National Estatepeople such as  Mr David  Yencken, a man who as interim  chairman  has shown himself to be a person of great wisdom, experience and enthusiasm in trying to see that future generations of Australians enjoy the heritage which only a few years ago was being swept away by our obsession with growth in terms of growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, growth of cities and so on; and Judith Wright, who for many years was once a voice crying in the wilderness but who is now a voice of significance in the community on this issue because of this legislation and because ofthe establishment of the Interim Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think one ought to place on record the very great work done by  Mr Davies  in the course of this operation to ensure that the company’s problems were brought to the notice of the Government, by organising several delegations of Tasmanian members of the House of Representatives and senators to the Ministers concerned- to the Treasurer and to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry- and in being able to prevail upon those Ministers to take positive action to head off the problem that was arising and which would have been a very serious blow indeed to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the whole region of north-western Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Opposition supports this Bill but in doing so it expresses the view that it would not have been necessary for the Parliament to consider legislation of this character if it had not been for the folly and gross mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The collapse in demand for fine papers coincided with a general downturn in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a sharp increase in the cost of financing large (even excessive) inventories, an easing in shipping which delivered outstanding orders at shorter intervals, and a fall-off in orders in the printing industry as users began to draw on their stocks rather than to place new orders and some merchants, at least, experienced liquidity problems as supplies from APPM and overseas mills have continued during the December quarter 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only did the great imports which came in not cure inflation, because inflation has increased most significantly ever since that statement was made, but also in their train there has been unemployment and dislocation and throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there has been a downturn of such proportions that this Government appears to be at its wits end to know what to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He even made one curious suggestion that to further the socialistic ambitions of the Government we were bent on some course of action designed deliberately to wreck the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suggest to honourable senators that they forget for all time this absurd suggestion that any economic difficulties that the country may be in at this time are the result of some deep dark plot by the machiavellian socialists designed to bring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to its knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It mattered not that industry profit could be squeezed to a degree which brought expansion and investment virtually to a halt, with devastating effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am arguing that Parliament should discuss these decisions because they are important and every decision in these reports has an important effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I can remember that Saudi Arabia hired a Pakistani gentleman- a banker and a distinguished economist- to develop its treasury procedures and to develop its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be little doubt that in the ultimate and we hope in the not too far distant future, the industry will round the corner and once again become as significant in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country as it has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, that asset is a great asset of the Australian people and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an industry with a tremendous significance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and ultimately it will climb out of the trough it is in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we would urge the Government to look at all these other possibilities of improving an industry which is in dire straits at the moment and which unquestionably will ultimately fulfil its potential in this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are superb signs of an industry, which probably more than any other is basic to the total balance of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, climbing out of yet another of its troughs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The orthodox objections that such funds could cause distortion, if admitted into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, were answered by my proposal to domicile such funds in the United States, invested in approved securities in the name of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and with the approval of the United States Federal Reserve Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw one opportunity to counter these temporary, short-term pressures on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and energy sources, while at the same time reaping long-term benefits of enduring significance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February 1972, Ansett Airlines and TAA agreed to set aside groups of seats in both first class and <span class="highlight">economy</span> class compartments for non-smokers, who might ask to bc seated in these areas when seats were being allocated prior to the departure of the flight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this regard non-smokers are now provided with 27 seats on DC-9 aircraft, 30 seats on B.72 7-100 aircraft and 36 seats on Boeing 727-200 aircraft, the number of seats being proportionate between first class and <span class="highlight">economy</span> class compartments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has come from our political enemies on the other side of the chamber, who are speaking, as I said a few moments ago, on behalf of those people who manipulate the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have of course had some admission on the part of the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  because we know now that the money was to be used to buy back the farm, to buy back the properties of Australia, with all the alarming effects that that would have had on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> arid our future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator seeks to make the point that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is still in a state of serious recession he will certainly get no dissent from me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I do not shun for one moment the responsibility which falls on this Government for some of the mistakes that it has made, I suggest that if honourable senators looked at the matter seriously they would realise that, as they have obviously been told lately, if they were running the <span class="highlight">economy</span> they could not expect any improvement in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Webster  and other honourable senators will be patient at least until 8 o’clock tonight they will discover what we propose to do to cure the ills of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a tremendous amount of buying power to put in the hands of one single authority without any evidence of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency and with considerable evidence of the possibility of duplication and some areas of inefficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can do anything at all to overcome the distress and disaster into which the Government has plunged the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the manufacturing industry the Opposition would certainly try to support that laudable aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the structure of our mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, where three out of four jobs are in the private sector, there are firm limits on how far the public sector should be stimulated in this recovery phase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a great uncertainty still hanging over our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, there is the danger of the creation of a great economic and centralised power operating in this community and operating with great power and influence over the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the problem of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time what we need very late in the day is an answer to a very serious matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is patently unnecessary and will result in a further reduction in the money available to the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last point of time at which any government should intervene in private industry and in private business which is under great stress is at this time when the Whitlam Government has brought the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to its knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the principal recommendations that the Committee brought to the attention of the Senate was that the Committee was satisfied that the Bill, if implemented, would have significant effects upon the private insurance industry, State government insurance offices, the state and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know him personally and I believe that in his heart of hearts he has some compassion and some concern for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the Government should or should not be involved in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, whether it should operate a shipping service to Tasmania, or whether it should sponsor the Australian Government Insurance Corporation are matters of subjective value judgment that are not subjective to any scientific proof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole community benefits from a zestful, buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which everyone who is eager to do so is encouraged to give of his or her best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disruption to private industry which provides jobs should the present system of provision of insurance be varied and the private sector be denied the ability to be the source of funds which it now is would create, in my opinion, havoc- real chaos- in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The use of long term economic planning to provide guidelines for the achievement of national objectives and to reduce uncertainty about the likely course of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a mandatory requirement for majority Australia ownership in key areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> where- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knows that it will be thrown out of office for its mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its sellout of the people who supported it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects on the whole private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> if creeping socialisation of the insurance industry proceeds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the people who have succeeded for the time being, not only in disrupting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also in organising opposition to the extent of influencing members of the Opposition Parties to oppose this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that that can be done at that level, but when an endeavour is made to do it at the national level it is claimed that it represents a threat to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is ludicrous that we should hear suggestions from Opposition senators that there would be any massive shift of capital from the insurance area or any dislocation of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> just because we make available in the Budget, in the interests of economic management in this country, approximately $800,000 to establish the Australian Government Insurance Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some well may wonder whether such a narrow group as that ought to be quite so influential in the total <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of course merely another way of saying what we all know- that is, that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time is in a state of recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that this statement is in direct contradiction of the Treasurer’s assurances that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a state of upturn and of the fact that the Treasurer has cast his Budget on the basis of a 5 per cent growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister enlarge on his statement in response to  Senator Cotton  that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a state of recession? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer pointed tentatively, cautiously and anything but euphorically to slight signs of upturn in certain aspects of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stressed the fact that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> still faces grave perils, that any recovery which is evident is fragile and tentative and that the measures which he put in as a package in his Budget are all essential if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to have any real chance of firm and certain recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that if  Mr Hayden  were here in this chamber to answer  Senator Guilfoyle  ‘s question he would gladly concede that the real state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at this moment is one of recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our difficulties are of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> still in a state of deep recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have done the correct things to speed that recovery, but we will not blink the fact that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as at the present time is depressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it would take some account of that, but I shall certainly ask the Commission to what extent the new <span class="highlight">economy</span> moves by government departments anyway might reflect their readjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one stroke it has added to the inflationary pressures within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by its incredible decision to increase indirect taxes and charges and by cutbacks in the wrong areas, it has increased the threat of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an unambiguous approach which would rely on substance and not a fragile psychology to revive the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and get unemployment down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People must attempt to evaluate whether this Government has brought Australia to this situation by intention, whether the situation has been achieved because Labor was unable to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, or whether the Government has been so inefficient as to cause this result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was told to reform the tax scale in order that it would reduce wage pressure and put more money in the taxpayers’ pockets as a basis for the expansion of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, the Treasury is saying that if there is a mess made of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and there is inflation we did it ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Reserve Bank, another non-political and detached institution, in its report which was brought down 2 days ago said that during 1974-75 the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> experienced more instability than for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twenty-three per cent is well above the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sustain sensibly through time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about therefore is the Treasurer’s assumption as outlined in his speech that the minus 2 per cent to minus 3 per cent of last year can be turned into a plus 5 per cent this year and that in effect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can grow by approximately 8 per cent over last year’s rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because he had the temerity to stand up to the oil companies we witnessed the disgusting spectacle of  Mr Lynch,  who purports to be the spokesman for the Opposition on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, taking the side of the big multinational oil companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that, with the wage structure which we have, those people make a greater contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country than people who leave school at 17 or 18 and stumble into an air-conditioned office, people who have never had to fight on the workshop floor, people who do not know what it is like getting up at 6 a.m. to go to work in a heavy, dusty area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not give anything like a real answer to the ills besetting the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the disabilities within the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I think that we can relate these problems to governmental outlays over the last two or three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Admirable though that expenditure may be in many areas, it represents an amount which was beyond the capacity of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> properly to afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Budget the depreciation allowance to industry is continued; but this allowance is not enough to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> off the ground and to give confidence back to the industrial and business sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, were credence to be given to the findings of the Mathews report and were its proposals to be implemented, as we propose, this would be a step in the direction that would lead to a recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These aims cannot be achieved for the benefit of the whole community unless there is the base of a sound and progressive <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a pretty valid analogy can be drawn between the governmental stewardship of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the irresponsible actions of, say, the young inheritor of a sound business who, through his attitude and policies in directing the affairs of the business of which he is suddenly put in charge, places the business in a ruinous position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I see it, that is the condition of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 40 per cent investment allowance proposal, the provision of specific incentives for rural industry, the return of the provision of a bounty on superphosphate, the abolition of the levies imposed upon the beef industry and that sort of thing are all matters which would have an impact upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> if implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>it does not restore confidence in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country over the years have fought an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which requires two pay packets in a family, and because people are willing to go out and work to try to create a financial base for the upbringing of their families the Government is hitting them with a heavy tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no area has the overall effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> been more marked than in the building industry with the apparent flow on effects that it has on so many other industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the simple fact that the Whitlam Government, on assuming office, inherited an explosive <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It inherited an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which the money supply had increased at an annual rate of 34 per cent in the last quarter of 1 972 as a direct result of the misconceived policies of the McMahon LiberalCountry Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the Treasurer’s judgment and the Government’s judgment is correct only time will tell, but the Budget is a bold attempt to rescue the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the difficulties into which it has drifted and simultaneously to protect the welfare of the weaker members of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reported in today’s  West Australian  that the Western Australian Government is studying the implications of the national Government’s decision to effect an <span class="highlight">economy</span> with respect to air travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be pointed out that the initial move to make this <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the national level was made by 2 Western Australian Ministers,  Senator Wheeldon  and  Mr Berinson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rubbed away in one foul swoop were incentives and compensations which were of immense value to the total Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in particular, to those areas of traditional primary production, that is, meat, fibre, grain, and dairy produce as well as the areas of mineral and oil exploration and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in making that sort of attack on that part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Government is in fact attacking an area of significant investment to the Australian people, an area of significant employment and an area concerned with a large measure of economic and social development in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the circumstance, what hope is there of a real measure of confidence returning to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country while it remains in the hands of the present Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget is a wideranging document, and tonight I intend to make just a few general observations and perhaps refer more particularly to the rural and export sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, for it is in that sector that we find the greatest number of small business operativesthe family farmer, the corner storekeeper, the garage proprietor, the electrician and the plumber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is providing a disincentive to enterprise at a time when enterprise is essential in this whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of soil, water and fodder conservation, in the area of income equalisation and in many other areas that have been rubbed away by the policies of this Government, there has been a total failure to admit that the reimposition of these incentives- the adoption of these attitudes- will be one significant way in which the private sector can start moving again and in which a real measure of employment and a real measure of productivity will return to our sorely tested <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are obvious measures and, indeed, not extremely expensive measures- not extremely expensive in the terms of an industry which quite clearly has a prominent, useful and important future in the total context of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer just briefly now to another area of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that has run down at an alarming pace in the past  2Vi  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second belief of the Government and of the Labor Party is that membership of the armed forces is as necessary an occupation as any job which forms part of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, only part of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> ‘s weakness can be attributed to external causes, such as the slump in wool prices in 1974 and the exclusion of Australian beef from its major markets- Japan, the United States and the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With about two-thirds of its petroleum requirement covered by indigenous crude oil, the direct impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the oil price increases has been modest and in the medium and long term Australia stands to benefit from the energy crisis with its abundance of energy resources such as coal, natural gas and uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that for the past 2 years at regular 6-monthly intervals the Opposition has come forward with positive policies on the economic level which it said would help to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and give relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything in the Opposition’s policy is aimed towards that end- towards restoring full employment, stabilising the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and reducing inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was expected that that document would chart the course for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> for the next 12 months and that it would be judged as a Budget that should have an important effect on the very great problems that face this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget was based on a 5 per cent growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when questions were asked in the Senate on 27 August we were able to extract from  Senator James  McClelland, Minister for Labor and Immigration, the thought that if the Treasurer,  Mr Hayden,  were here he would gladly concede that the real state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the moment is one of recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our difficulties are those of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> still in a state of deep recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To see a further round of industrial difficulties and a substantial curtailment in the number of companies which are able to survive makes us place in question the 5 per cent increase in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> on which this Budget has been based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Administration spokesmen argue that if the Government were to rush strong stimulative medicine to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at this time, the result would be a new bout of inflationary sickness and unemployment that would be even more severe than that during the past eighteeen months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor really showed us what inflation was, really showed us how our savings could be eroded and really showed us how people could go to the wall when a Labor <span class="highlight">economy</span> was allowed to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one would think that a government which cared and which planned its <span class="highlight">economy</span> would have seen from the figures that there was a boom coming in the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That challenge is to present economic policies that would restore to good health a sick and shattered <span class="highlight">economy</span>, an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is bedevilled by the twin evils of inflation and unemployment, but an <span class="highlight">economy</span> shattered largely because of the policies that this Government has followed over the past 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little evidence that the Government, having in some cases at last recognised the fact, accepts just how serious a state the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this has resulted in an unstable <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a high, almost crippling, rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until private business is given confidence the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not begin to improve and unemployment will continue to rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Productivity is the key to restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this Government’s ability to destroy the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we have had an ever increasing level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unbelievable that the sound <span class="highlight">economy</span> inherited by this Government in 1972 could be wrecked so quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government had shown the same ability to build as it has to destroy, Australia today would possess a strong and stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have sufficient faith in the average Australian, even if the Government has not, to believe that we can stimulate production and investment if the challenge which faces us is put squarely to the average Australian and he is told that his expectations can be achieved only by a sound and developed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and by hard work and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Melzer  did not acknowledge was the fact that the increased postal and telecommunications charges will be fuel for further inflation, as will the indirect tax on petrol which will be felt throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small businesses are able to live with a steady inflation rate of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent with growth conditions applying in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but they cannot live with an inflation rate of around 17 per cent or 20 per cent when there is an almost nil growth rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seasonally adjusted level of registered unemployment, 4.8 per cent at the end of July, the low levels of average overtime, 1.6 hours seasonally adjusted level in June, and the decline in the ANZ index of factory production in May- the index was 12 per cent below that of a year ago- provide the testimony of spare capacity presently existing in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an admission by the Government that expenditure in the public sector was running at too high a level for present conditions in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we freely concede, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has paid a price for this expansion in the deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a total increased expenditure of more than $3 billion, and no matter how we fiddle the figures I suggest with respect that that would involve us in a deficit which none of the responsible economists considers would be justified in the present state of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one is to have a planned <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as we have in other areas of primary production, it seems to me to be unreasonable to allow the entry into the production of beef of people who are not traditional growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The difference is essentially that this Government will endeavour to ride out inflation whereas the Opposition would take to inflation with a bludgeon and shake out the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the traditional way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The percentage method of escalation of costs in a capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span> leads to constant inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot be separated from the economies of the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are inflationary pressures outside Australia which affect our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hunger of China for rubber will lead to an increase in its price and that price increase will be injected into our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that inflation is due not only to some of our decisions within our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very much due to decisions made outside our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and we must recognise that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard it said that the world is adding fuel to our inflation and that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is aflame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The credit squeeze of 1961 really brought the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to its knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present dme is in trouble, but I believe that the Budget which  Mr Hayden  has brought down is a responsible one in the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst recognising that New Zealand has an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that in some instances is different from ours in that it is more rurally based, I think the same situation still applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be rectified only when inflation is arrested and full employment prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This position will emerge when a middle of the road policy is implemented by the Government, when capital and labour realise that each is dependent on the other and when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> allows us to get our full share of the export market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>it does not restore confidence in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In very difficult times rural industry has not been able to play its rightful role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all of them will indicate where the people of Tasmania need help, either because of the neglect of one aspect or another of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or because of the effect of particular aspects of this Government’s philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is being done by a government that says it is trying to restore confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> air fare between Hobart and Melbourne has increased from $25.50 in 1973 to just over $38 now-a rise of almost 50 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same period the <span class="highlight">economy</span> air fare between Launceston and Melbourne has risen from $19.50 to nearly $31- an increase of some 58 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I do not think that we will see much Government help being provided to this most important aspect of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It almost seems as though the unions are in control of this country or, at least, in control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> has felt the effect of a great deal of bullying strikes during the period of this Labor reign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of Parliament engage in their annual gabfest as they put forward their theories of how this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> should operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we all know, or should know, that it is only one of the methods by which influences can be exerted within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong to suggest that the Budget can have any great effect on the way in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are led by Opposition spokesmen to believe that all we have to do is to cut back government spending and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be back into high speed gear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  the Premier of Queensland, said that if the States did not get the money unemployment would worsen and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would fall to pieces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that if the Australian Government spends public funds it will worsen the economic position; yet the State Premiers took the view that unless they got those funds there would be a downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is strange reasoning on behalf of Opposition senators to suggest that within that one-quarter of total expenditure the answer to the problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be found, particularly when a comparison of the figures show that of that onequarter of total expenditure only half is Commonwealth Government spending; the other half is expended by the State, semi-government and local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This particular Budget effects a substantial transfer of payment from the productive sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He points out that manufacturing is a very important segment of our private sector <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that it employs more than one-quarter of all our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He points out the need for the private sector to take up its own challenge and to become associated with the changing attitudes of the consumers and the changing attitude of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, technology and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of matter which 1 think deserves at least some passing consideration while we are dealing with the Budget, because when we deal with the Budget we deal with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, which is primarily a capitalist country, and we cannot look at this Budget without looking at the economies of the other capitalist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot be touched by the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the huge volume of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is in private hands- a large part of it in foreign hands- whatever is done in a Budget still goes only part of the way towards resolving any economic questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as we have a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the authority which can be exercised in any budget is limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time we acknowledge that there has been an unduly high rate of expenditure in the non-profitable areas of the public sector, that there has been a disproportionately high amount of the revenue of this country spent in fields which are essential but which at the same time are not such fields that one ought to be spending in them amounts of money which will lead in other respects to damage being caused to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with the problem of the growth of the public sector we have been faced with the fact that the increase in wages has been disproportionate to the rate of development of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the increase in wages and incomes which has taken place throughout Australia has added to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schmidt, and before him, Willie Brandt, had to appeal to the West German workers to restrain their demands, to restrain their requests, which in any other situation could be regarded as per.fectly legitimate, in order that the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> does not collapse and that all of those things which we have built up after so many years of struggle will not be washed away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is at such a stage that, according to the Budget, the Government is quite prepared to accept an inflation rate of 16 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the effect will go on right through the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He wants parliamentarians to travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class, but what does  Mr Whitlam  intend to do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He does not intend to travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no reason why he cannot travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class with the rest of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  ‘s suggestion that he cannot travel <span class="highlight">economy</span> class for security reasons is ludicrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators can see the whole benefits of <span class="highlight">economy</span> in joint service- in pay and recruitment, staff records, training, computer service, communication, transport and research into operational records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a department, and myself as a Minister, are concerned at the proposal that such a responsible person as the Leader of the Opposition would undo, or would fail to proceed with, something that has been accepted by all sections in Australia as one of the greatest contributions to, one of the greatest advances in, police supervision that we have in Australia and would do so under the false plea of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the fact that they present the financial program of the Government the Budget documents indicate the Government’s attitude to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; they indicate the Government’s attitude to the commercial state of the country and they indicate the Government’s attitude to the social and educational and other needs of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, this claim completely ignored economic realities and the need for the Government today to initiate policies that would restore a measure of stability to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government and the Budget which it has put down have caused this crisis in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the last few years stemmed initially, in large part, from the unsettled world economic conditions . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that increase we have seen a massive shift of resources from the private sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can do so only if we have an Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is sound, alive and vibrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can do so only if we have behind that <span class="highlight">economy</span> a community which is confident and able to contribute to it because it is able to seize the rewards of its own work, is able to accept responsibility and is not totally dependent upon governments as the Australian community is rapidly becoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a Budget which only marginally provided the stimulus which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so urgently needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resources which they could apply to assisting with the rebuilding of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and their own futures have been removed from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is our desire as has been expressed by  Mr Hayden,  to assist the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in overcoming some of its difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has kept itself fully informed on developments in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at large and has adjusted its approach accordingly with commendable promptness in difficult times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2, The Budget and the <span class="highlight">Economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cotton  dealt in depth with the financial and taxation aspects and  Mr Fraser  put in very clear and concise terms exactly how we, if we were in government, would reduce expenditure and at the same time create incentive to try to get industry, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the country generally back on the rails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a government throws a levy of $2 a barrel on crude oil, which will have a great impact throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I cannot understand its logic and I doubt whether it has any wisdom, because that levy will have a very inflationary effect which will be cumulative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, from its very limited point of view, may believe that the Budget we are considering is tackling inflation; nevertheless we are concerned with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which the problem of inflation not only is paramount but also has reached frightening proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been brought about substantially by the policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have increased not as a result of inflation but as a result of deliberate Government policies that the public sector should increase its outlays to that level, which policies inevitably have led to the serious state of inflation from which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> now suffers and which we as a nation are now facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the claims that have been made by Ministers, Government speakers and most recently  Senator Bishop  in this debate, I would have thought that his colleague  Senator James  McClelland, the Minister for Labor and Immigration, had painted the grimmest possible picture of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the problem which we are now facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably an even more authoritative opinion on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the problems of the nation is presented by the most recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Australia which was issued as recently as July 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That points out very clearly that although the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been affected dramatically by oil prices, in fact they had a minor bearing in Australia and the real problem of inflation in Australia has been the rapidly rising wage costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the last few years stemmed initially, in large pan, from the unsettled world economic conditions, but more recently domestic factors have become preponderant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the authorities are faced at present with one of the highest rates of inflation among Member countries, essentially of a cost-push nature, which has had widespread effects throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and has led to policy impasses and resort to a series of specific measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason we say that is because the Budget really does not tackle in a significant and effective way the basic problem facing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- the causes of inflation and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something has been added today to the gloom facing the nation due to the serious state of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was very clearly pictured not only by the OECD report but was also outlined by  Senator James  McClelland, the Minister for Labor and Immigration, when he spoke on behalf of the Government in this debate some days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one which we believe, and which we have every reason to believe, would give the type of stimulus that the private sector requires and which would, in particular, demonstrate the bona fides of the Government in its claim that it wants the private sector to restore its hitherto important place in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is perfectly clear that the charges which these Commissions are imposing are entirely a result of the policies that have been pursued by this Government both generally as far as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is concerned and specifically as far as the 2 Commissions’ financial objectives are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to turn finally to the mining industry because if ever there has been one dramatic example of the failures of this Government and indeed its total misunderstanding of what the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is all about it is its treatment of the mining industry and its policies and lack of policies in relation to that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policies adopted by the former coalition government, the partnership, served to elevate the rural industries to a high status and to a level which contributed very greatly to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It points out that an <span class="highlight">economy</span> measure which BHP had to adopt with respect to maintenance caused supporting industries to be put out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that a large amount of trouble with our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is caused by disruption from communist dominated trade unions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of commentators have observed recently that many of the trends presently apparent in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> show a close similarity to the economic difficulties being experienced in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a general agreement that the proper functioning of a Government/free enterprise mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> requires a responsible and co-operative attitude between the representatives of capital, management, labour and Government in order to achieve the maximum economic prosperity for all citizens in any country . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until this country can disabuse itself of the idea that, just because a year passes, there should be an increase in anything we will never regain a sensible and responsible <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government must take action to start to remove itself from the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and let us get on with our own business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a direct result of this Government’s restructuring of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in favour of government enterprise, if one can call it that, and opposed to private enterprise we are breeding a race of bludgers and parasites who are waiting on government handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget attempted to draw some sort of a balance between getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the road and making some attack on inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full implementation of the recommendations of the Mathews Committee may have been desirable but would have been, from the point of view of the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, totally irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should take action and start removing itself from our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and let us get on with the business of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure we could have better relations between labour and management if we could start the Government on the road to reducing its role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that once more money will have value and stop these discreditable taxes and indirect taxes on petrol, posts, telephones, liquor and cigarettes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Budget, for which we, the Opposition, and the people of Australia waited so eagerly, was heralded as being a concerned Government’s attempt to come to very real grips with our flagging <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He no doubt is bemused by this great economic brainchild, which has been exploded by every well-known economist and exposed in this chamber and in the other place by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  as a shoddy attempt to stabilise our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure many Australians will agree with me, when I categorically state that these ills which presently beset our <span class="highlight">economy</span> have been created by this Government’s lavish and reckless spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have the greatest regard for  Mr Hayden  ‘s economic ability and I am quite confident that he was aware of the remedies needed to stabilise our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know, and I am sure you would know,  Sir, that  there is a present awareness in all walks of life that there is something drastically wrong with our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under a coalition government and the stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> which it engendered I provided- and, I submit, provided adequately- for my family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget, in my opinion, has failed miserably to help to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing in Australia that is of general interest at the moment it is the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and I think the great and besetting interest in politics which we see in Australia at the moment is a function of the uncertainty that people feel in the economic sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It established the pacesetter principle of ‘Let us go; let us all get more’ and wages outstripped the ability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one thinks of the possible developments that were on foot in 1972 in Australia and what has happened to them, then I think one can again sheet home to this Government a lot of the blame for the flaccid <span class="highlight">economy</span> that exists in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those developments by themselves would have put a completely different complexion on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in that field I would suggest to honourable senators opposite that the productive ability of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has in fact been cut back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is committed to the present ‘mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>’ framework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the private sector which needs to be strengthened if unemployment is to be beaten and if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to be put in better shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> where the Government is trying to restore confidence to the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases, the productive capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will decline and we shall all eventually be worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite true to say that that did affect the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Chaney  has just said, it would be foolish for anyone to suggest that what has happened in Australia has been the result solely of that factor; but it would be equally idle to suggest that it did not affect our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States of America did it to the extent of a deficit of $80,000m in order to re-stimulate its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of those measures were taken to ensure that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> would come back to a state of economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to deal now with what seems to me to be the most important aspect of the amendment, that is, paragraph (3), which says that this Budget does not restore confidence in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thrust of the Budget, as the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  has pointed out, is to nurture the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> through what is now a gathering momentum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But given the attitude of the Government, given the assistance it has made available to industry and to the general redistribution of resources in this country, I believe that the Government can say confidently that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is moving back into a state of growth which will utilise to the full the resources of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that time will reveal the strengthening of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> under the policies of this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general stance of monetary policy will remain such that the liquidity of the banking system is sufficient to meet the basic immediate needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for finance without being fully accommodating to inflationary demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad objective of the Government’s monetary policy at present is to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to meet the basic immediate needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> without being fully accommodating to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that in many areas the Government has been remiss in respect of its promises to the people and in the way in which it has led the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the past 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for instance, to the Prime Minister’s statements in 1972 and 1974 when the Opposition advocated reductions in taxation as the way in those 2 years the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the community could be made more attractive and more stable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Government which is totally incapable of managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The millions of dollars which that government pumped into South Vietnam caused the greatest erosion of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic growth and well-being of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> are directly linked to its ability to sustain continued development of its overseas trade- two-way trade, both imports and exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment states that the Senate is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia’s economic crisis because it does not provide an adequate program to defeat inflationwhich is a statement that I doubt- and because it does not relieve unemployment, it does not restore confidence in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it does not provide real tax relief to provide a proper basis for wage and salary restraint and it fails to restrain government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing about all this is that it is well within the knowledge of most honourable senators who sat on that Committee that there are a number of areas in other parts of the world that have plantation economies which, in fact, is the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This plantation <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been in existence for well over 100 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Primmer  mentioned it is an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a society of delicate fabric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  said it was against Liberal Party policy to reject the budget and that he would overcome this by claiming that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in such a mess that he just had to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The large increase in outlays between July 1974 and July 1975 reflected in the main the rapid growth in outlays which occurred during the latter part of 1974-75 following the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Government’s attitude towards the recommendations regarding brucellosis and superphosphate will be determined by the extent of the decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia balances its well-being, its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, on the knife edge of its ability to trade in world markets and to establish goodwill and good faith in contracting between itself as the seller and other nations as the buyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be some sort of governmental supervision and some sort of guarantee of a return to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end result undoubtedly will be a balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The indirect effects are felt in the areas of freight, fares, power generation and, indeed, across a whole canvas of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, its capacity to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country is in some considerable measure of doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself is significant within our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in creating jobs, in creating homes, in creating a transport system, and in improving and developing ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding my remarks on these Bills, might I reiterate once again that it is an extremely bad system of taxation to tax exports in a country in which exports are the cornerstone of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, of its total community, whether we like it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one or two of our major export industries, considered in the context of the cost structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, certainly cannot afford export taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a dreadful reflection on a government which is responsible for an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that it should be creating a circumstance where those sorts of opportunities may well flash by without the whole community being able to gain the proper benefit that should come its way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not doubt that once this levy becomes a permanent part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> it will be infinitely easier to finance the development work that is envisaged in the paragraph 1 have just read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the policy of the OPEC countries has had a dramatic effect on the whole world <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last year or more and we must expect that they will continue this policy and that Australia within 5 years will be directly and severely suffering from a lack of exploration for and development of crude oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There had been a 16-year drought which had very serious effects upon the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why the Queensland <span class="highlight">economy</span> did not collapse during the period of the drought was that concurrent with it, tremendous expansion was taking place in the mining industry, notably in the coal mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thiess Peabody Mitsui, which employs 1000 men at Moura, a town very close to Biloela and which has had an effect on the Biloela <span class="highlight">economy</span>, spent a total of $.721m on infrastructure $.077m on power and water and $0,382 m on the town itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From that amount of $544m the companies are being asked, in view of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time, to pay to the Commonwealth in the community interest a tax of what has been stated by  Mr Connor  to be $ 120m as some return for the mineral wealth that the companies have discovered and developed and from which they are getting a handsome profit at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, in commenting on the crucial role of wage indexation in the Government’s economic strategy, I have continually pointed out the fragile nature of the improvement which is in prospect for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is apparent that despite the imploring of the AMA, through its gazette, to doctors to take part in the sabotage of Medibank, the majority of doctors are patriotic citizens who do not wish to disrupt the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and who wish to see that the laws of the country are carried out effectively and are providing this information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government that at this time last year stated to the people that it would manage the affairs of this country and bring about a deficit of some $500m, a figure that was accepted by this Parliament, ended its financial management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> last year with a deficit of $2,567m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for that reason that I hope that when there is some response later today to this Bill more perspective will be given to the consequences of the use of this Loan Bill for defence purposes and the matters that are so important to the management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only this afternoon  Mr Fraser,  I believe, was interviewed by the Press and said that he could not do anything about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard the old story of the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> was bad and someone had to give it a lift, and individuals and councils should see to it that that lift is given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Suffice to say that the main function of government today is to bring capital and labour to a realisation that they are dependent on each other to create an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will permit us to get a full share of the export market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) I listened with some care and want to make one or two observations before passing to the general area of concern- the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that those 2 groups of responsible non-political authorities had said to us that in 1974-75 the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> experienced more instability than for many years, aggregate output declined for the first time since 1952-53, consumer prices rose by 17 per cent approximately and unemployment reached nearly 5 per cent of the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is still flat, it is not growing and the expectations expressed I do not think will work out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will you again entrust the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the men who deliberately, but needlessly, created Australia’s worst unemployment for 10 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has been trying to maintain the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country on an even keel, by advocating wage indexation and by restraint in public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will have the problem of trying to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> running when the unions say, as  Senator Douglas  McClelland said: ‘This is the law of the jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the many stoppages which delay and throw out of gear the schedules under which Australian National Line ships operate, and therefore cause ships to be sent back and forth across Bass Strait after having been only partly unloaded or only partly loaded, are creating havoc in the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us remember that the successful treatment of tuberculosis in Britain saved the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">economy</span> 55m annually at a time when the total drug bill for the United Kingdom was f 100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the treatment of one disease, by the reduction in the number of work absences, by the reduction in mortality and by the reduction in pension requirements the British <span class="highlight">economy</span> was able to save f 55m at a time when its total expenditure on drugs was f 100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It indicates some kind of effective cost control at a time when costs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were running wild. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But because of the improving position of the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the greater need for the cheaper beef to be imported in order to keep down the cost of living in Japan, it is likely that the increase in the quota will continue but to what extent is difficult to assess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This attempt to restore these Bills to the notice paper is another artificial device by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to avoid the real issues, the real issues being his mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, his incompetence as an administrator and the destruction he has brought to Australia in the short space of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far so good for him, but if the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> comes to a stop and there is a crisis- a defence situation, or a problem in  Senator Cavanagh  ‘s portfolio in regard to supplying police to airports- who is going to squeal then? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been pointed out by other Government speakers that an endeavour was made by Oppositions senators during the sittings of the Estimates Committees to prove that this Government could not manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to say that we had got things in a mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The way in which our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now running is quite frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once wages and salaries are fixed without taking into account the productivity of the land in this rural producing country, it is very difficult to have a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick then went on to talk about the record deficit of this Government and the fact that this so-called mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> had resulted in this record deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This record deficit was caused, of course, by the need for the Government to expand its spending last year because of the run down in the economysomething which had happened in all the advanced economies around the world, most of which are major trading partners with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have decided to increase pensions this year by rises in the consumer price index as a temporary measure to ease the pressures of public spending on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that such a trend constitutes a threat to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as well as to the style and quality of Australian life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known fact of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that most small businesses- a very high proportion of them- eventually go bankrupt or go out of business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a continuing trend throughout our <span class="highlight">economy</span> for many years for the bulk of small businesses to find themselves in very great difficulties after a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may have thought that a body that is expert in trading with a centrally planned <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as China would be one whose views should be sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I have already quoted the opinion of the Australia-China Business Co-operation Committee, which is an expert body in trading with a centrally planned <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government control, government assistance, government involvement in international trade, as in so many fields, is a perfectly legitimate and necessary situation; but in this circumstance and in this form we do not believe that it has anything to contribute to the circumstances that exist in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could perhaps help with banking facilities and provide assistance which, through the running of a sound <span class="highlight">economy</span> and through reducing inflation, would be of the most inestimable importance to the success of exporters and importers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because Iraq is a State-controlled <span class="highlight">economy</span>, business is often carried out by means of public tender, although there is an increasing trend to issue invitations to selected known and reliable manufacturers and consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Prime Minister and this Government with policies which have caused a lack of confidence in this nation’s potential and created inflation and unemployment not experienced for 40 years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prize will be this country and its future in terms of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, philosophical and policy management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Budget were to be placed aside it would have disastrous effects from the point of view of the obvious recovery that is taking place within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there is this continuing attitude by the Opposition, an attitude which it seems to me is designed to undermine public confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want honourable senators to have some regard to their attitudes, to look at this area of decision making away from their political philosophy, to look at it from the point of view of what it will do to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest forecasts are that the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> will take much longer than expected to pull out of the worst recession since the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not take into account the economic difficulties that face all of the western countries but endeavour to convince the Australian people that there is something exceptional and something different as far as the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indictment of the Opposition parties that they should use this stratagem at this point when in fact all the evidence points to a recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to the Australian Government being able properly to govern this country in the interests of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one remembers how treaties with other countries, in modern times, affect the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> at home and the whole structure of relations with and obligations to other nations abroad, one sees how powerful is the position of the Senate in America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Prime Minister and this Government with policies which have caused a lack of confidence in this nation ‘s potential and created inflation and unemploy me nt not experienced for 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I have said and what other speakers on this side of the Senate have said throughout this crisis: The issue is not the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; the issue is the survival of parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> has not improved in that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every day we hear from the Opposition that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is getting worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a period when there has been no real uplift in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, when, according to the Opposition, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has declined, its standing and its Leader’s standing in the community has deteriorated to that extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I refer the Opposition to the gallup poll and to the movement in the figures-  or that the consequences of refusal of Supply are too damaging to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or inflict too great hardship on the whole community, decides to pass the Supply Bills; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if they examine all those indices they can form no conclusion but that they are on the wrong path and that they are exacerbating the problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to which they are constantly pointing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should not continue on its present course until the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country is completely plundered and there is a depression the like of which we have never seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is they who are depriving the people of the financial sinews that are necessary to keep the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other honourable senators have spoken about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally and the rundown which has taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen what the Government has done regarding its mistakes in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those statements prove the pertinent point that not only is  Mr Fraser  in a situation where he can lead his Party into wrecking the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and wrecking the lives of thousands of people, but also that he was a totally deceitful Minister in the days when he held a portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being delayed, and it is the effect of that delay on the whole of Australia, on the people of Australia and on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is of gravest concern both to the Government and to the people, I believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this practice contribute to inflation in this section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article continues:  -something one might have thought was of prime consideration at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is as tight as a winklepicker shoe on a policeman’s foot- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has shown that it is well aware that short-term problems can intrude into the consideration of longer term issues, particularly when the general level of activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is below normal, and that appropriate action must be introduced to cope with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s intention in establishing the IAC was to extend the Tariff Board system of public inquiries and reports to all sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in order to ensure greater consistency and coherence in the provision of assistance to industries, and thereby promote the interests of the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also involves the provision of positive measures to improve the mobility, quality and productivity of resources generally in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has devoted considerable attention in its report to structural change in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has discussed in some detail the nature and causes of structural change and capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to cope with such change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now general agreement that structural change resulting from changes in Government assistance must proceed at a pace the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Commission makes clear, the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to cope with change is dependent upon the general level of activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the mobility of the community’s resources and the availability of adequate adjustment assistance mechanisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, in agreeing with  Mr Rattigan  on the need to relate changes in assistance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s capacity to adapt to such change, said that the Government required the fullest information on the social and locational effects of the Commission’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that it became apparent to the IAC that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was operating at less than full capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A return to that situation is contrary to the best interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole and all persons concerned with home ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner some of the more liberal members in  Mr Fraser’s  Party stand up to him and say: ‘This far, no further’, the sooner democracy will be allowed to go on and the Government to get down to the job, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to be brought back into its proper perspective and the Australian people to see the further results of Labor legislation flow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this also an attempt to cover up for the Government’s mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by falsely blaming the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  said it was against Liberal Party policy to reject the budget and that he would overcome this by claiming that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in such a mess that he just had to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real cure or relief for the position of local government can come only when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is returned to stability, when inflation is mitigated and when interest rates are diminished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Thursday evening I referred to the gross and monumental incompetence of the Government in relation to its economic and financial policies and said that in 1972 the Government inherited a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> which within a matter of months it turned from an area of financial and economic stability to one of economic instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of one thing we can be certain, and that is that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not suffer the consequences of the Opposition’s act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What members of the Opposition parties should do- and most of them now are taking the view that  Mr Fraser  got them into this mess and  Mr Fraser  should get them out of it- is at their next Party meeting, and I say this with all sincerity and for the good of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to advise  Mr Fraser  to back off and back off quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are prepared to hold up the business of this country, to jeopardise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country, to jeopardise the defence of the country and to jeopardise the whole democratic structure of this country, all because of some information or alleged information which is obtained in these ludicrous documents including statements about flashing lights, London times, and the Prime Minister, the Governor-General and the Governor of the Reserve Bank all standing by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no question of the Senate Opposition taking this sort of action if indeed the Government had been performing in a way which ensured that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country improved constantly, or was holding its own in terms of world economics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country is far from being in a satisfactory position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, despite what Government senators say, under the previous 3 years of LiberalCountry Party Government we had progress and prosperity, we had a sound <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we had one of the best and most progressive nations in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Government which has so reduced the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that thousands of small businesses are going to the wall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He engaged in his normal and usual attack on this Government for its mishandling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, for inflation, for unemployment, for the collapse of small businesses, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are hardly figures which would substantiate the argument that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in any way comparable in its recession with the economies of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is ensuring the minimum disruption to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the minimum hardship to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Prime Minister and this Government wilh policies which have caused a lack of confidence in this nation’s potential and created inflation and unemployment not experienced for 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would make a massive difference to monetary conditions in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> if, on the one extreme the deficit were financed by creation of new money, or on the other, by long-term borrowing from the non-bank public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Council would not be needed to give surveys of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, on which there is already a considerable amount of material, official and private, nor to indulge in esoteric research, but to address itself directly to policy problems and feasible solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ‘monetarist’ economists, mainly following Professor Milton Friedman, suggest that the annual growth of the money supply should be equal to the rate of real growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, averaging around 5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a commitment of the Opposition that it will be adopted when we are in the position to do so because we believe it is vital for the strengthening of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the growth that we would all expect to achieve in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The profit-based market system should be seen not as a way of life, some consecration of pecuniary values, but should be looked at as one of the main social institutions which our type of <span class="highlight">economy</span> has for allocating scarce resources to meet numerous wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Company tax proposals, which do not recognise the long term difficulties in the present inflated <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I believe should have received more recognition by the Government when it was bringing forward the Budget for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt the Minister will realise the importance of air transport to and from Tasmania and appreciate that any increase in air fares is detrimental both to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the State from the tourist point of view and to those Tasmanians who need to travel from the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I put it to the honourable senator that already what the Opposition Parties are doing at present is seriously imperilling not only the aviation industry but also, of course, the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Prime Minister and this Government with policies which have caused a lack of confidence in this nation’s potential and created inflation and unemployment not experienced for 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In terms of what the community has come to regard as normal, economic conditions in 1975 are very difficult; a complex set of strong forces, some of which have acted in opposing directions, have carried the <span class="highlight">economy</span> quite a distance from a normal or equilibrium position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are schemes which obviously have been damaging to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government has wrecked the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in so many areas and it will take many years of sensible government to recover from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very few members of Parliament from the Government Party could earn $5,000 a year in business, which is a reflection of the way the Government has dealt with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the past 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He undoubtedly is able to express himself on how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should fare, but it never struck me as impressive that, after being a member of this Parliament for most of his life and receiving the very substantial income that we all get as members of Parliament, he could proudly say that he never had sufficient money to purchase a motor car or to pay off his own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have lectured us at length about the deficiencies within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and have, not applied themselves to any considerable extent to the substantial benefits that will accrue to the community as a result of the passage of these 3 Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some years when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in a somewhat tight position and it was necessary to get more money into circulation, there was some minor reduction in income tax- I think to the extent of 2  lh  per centbut once the <span class="highlight">economy</span> got back on to its feet, in the view of the Government at that time, that concession was taken off in the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser, Mr Lynch,  honourable senators who have taken part in the debate on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and even newspapers in their editorials have referred to the need for restructuring the tax system in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the general position with which we are faced because of the Opposition’s move, all I can say is that certain decisions have been taken with a view to achieving administrative <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to conserving financial resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thought that the members of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament were supposed to have some sort of contact with the trade union movement and the people at large who work in Australia, but it is quite obvious that they are nothing but a bunch of doctrinaire socialists who have no interest whatever  in getting some 350 000 people re-employed in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn away from mining and exploration to deal with an industry which for decades has been a mainstay of our internal <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we appreciate the need for restraint in financial assistance and realise the stresses currently burdening our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we know that the complete collapse of this once vibrant industry will impose far-reaching hardships not only upon the Territory people but also upon the many markets which depend heavily on the Territory’s beef production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if this is at all possible it will be done pursuant to the present Government’s attitude to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without going into very much detail, the development of tourism in the Northern Territory would assist greatly the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From it comes the drive for growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the key to economic success in our current fight to rebuild a shattered <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope, and I am sure all honourable senators on this side of the chamber hope, that the Government will realise that some of the matters on which it has embarked already will have a disastrous effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> unless they can be curbed and unless they can be related further to sound development and the curtailment of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important to remember now as we are looking to the Governor-General’s Speech that unless sound economic management is underlying and is accepted to be underlying government approach to overall policy, there will not be within the community that degree of confidence which underlies any sound <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is only one simple fundamental in a modern <span class="highlight">economy</span> which governs the effect of any monetary or fiscal measures which may be taken- that is, the way in which they are viewed in the modern era of instant communication in which the average person in the community is able to receive immediately through radio, television and the newspapers a feed out from the Government and form an impression about what the Government is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we go from one Government which frittered away confidence to another Government which fritters away confidence, the prospect of restoring the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be dim indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The small people suffer and when the small people suffer the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> suffers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an area which I believe may dominate- I put it that way- the regrowth of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in so many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Granted, we have problems with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor having been given a go, after having misled the Australian community into believing that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was improving and that unemployment was coming down, what did we eventually find? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> was racing at a frightening rate and inflation was heading for a rate of 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, over the years in Australia whilst many small businesses went out of existence- they will continue to do so- they were being replaced by businesses in greater number as Australia for so long was expanding its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we have reached a situation where it will take a long time for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to recover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the blind politics and ideologies of a certain political party in power, because of the mis-allocation of resources, because of its doctrinaire socialist policies by which the Government was to take in all and spend all, we have had excess spending by that Government and a total mis-allocation of resources culminating in a crisis situation in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer also to the survey I mentioned earlier which showed that there is no more optimism by employers in the basic structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than there was during the course of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sensible requirements in money supply expansion should have regard to the inflation rate and to the net economic growth rate or the net minus economic growth rate, and above that there should be some capacity to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving a little more strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is the sort of <span class="highlight">economy</span> that the Government is practising it would look very funny if we had another Sheila Cassidy case not in Santiago but in Rangoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not say we will, but this is just an illustration of this madness about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that as crisis fell upon the Parliament in the latter period and as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> got into trouble there was perhaps some lessening of this efficiency and that some of the attitude of reasonableness which was to be found in this assembly was lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the future, as far as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the Government’s budgetary considerations will permit, we will do our utmost to ensure that people who have a cause to put to enable the conservation issue to be tested and examined will be given assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of the major costs in the consumer price index is home interest and as encouragement to the home building industry is a quick way to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will the Minister or the Treasurer consider implementing a scheme of tax free, low interest- say 5 per cent- deposits at savings banks and building societies to be lent to low income, first home applicants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the information collected is of vital importance to the work of many sections of the community, including Government departments and planning agencies, and given that such costs as wages and computer time are likely to increase in the next year, what justification can the Minister provide for this seemingly false <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policies as enunciated in the Governor-General’s Speech imply quite definitely that we aim to revive the private sector upon which the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> depends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That retraining was to the disadvantage of people in industry who were forced out of their jobs by the policies of the previous Government and who were genuinely looking for some assistance to re-inject them into industry, perhaps in some other area, so that they could contribute to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that, combined with the Minister’s assurance that there is going to be a thorough review of the whole scheme and with an understanding that all affected groups will be consulted, these measures will serve to help the Government’s attempt to control inflation and they will help it in its long term objective of assisting those in need in a nation with a stable and secure <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures have been rendered necessary in the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and as a result of the introduction of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had that type of action not been contemplated and put into effect the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would have been in a much worse state as a result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is purely and simply a matter of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that people will take <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures to go to these outpatient clinics and therefore bypass their own doctor who probably knows their medical history better than any other doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the Government is intent that the disadvantaged will shoulder the burden of the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Federal Government has to do something about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as honourable senators realise, some of these advantages turn to gross disadvantages in terms of Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, for,  Mr Deputy President,  one cannot eat and drink beauty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a most courageous statement to be made by government today not only in this country but also in any parliamentary system, because it has been a distinguishing feature of political debate in Western democracies for several decades now that the direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be away from the private sector and towards the government sector- towards public expenditure and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a feature of political debate in the Western world that goes back, I suppose, to the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt in the early 1930s and that certainly was given accelerated force by the Labour victory in the United Kingdom in 1945, that there should be greater participation by government in not only the control but also the production of the resources of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He intended to pay for the program by the increase in the annual growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it was found that because of the policies of that Government, policies which were completely contrary to the ones that are being espoused by the present Government, there was this depressing effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was the first person of whom I am aware who not only made it clear that there was a very real limit on what governments could do and that people such as ourselves who are responsible for passing the laws which make the provision of such services available to the community must observe that fact, but also that citizens must observe it and understand the limits within which governments can work in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, no matter how strong that <span class="highlight">economy</span> may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is false <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every businessman will be hoping that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> performs well under Fraser from the start (in which case a debt will be owed to former Treasurer, Bill Hayden) because this will give him the fortitude to carry out the really major planks of his platform relating to the corporate sector . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of the erosion of benefits to pensioners that has arisen through inflationary trends in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and other difficulties through which we have lived in the past 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With subsequent revisions of the Budget estimates, and before allowing for the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures an overall deficit of the order of $4.7 billion and a deficit of close to $3 billion in the Consolidated Revenue <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  took it upon himself- I know his action was very much against the feelings of many members of the present Opposition who were then in government- to reduce the standard of air travel for members of Parliament from first class to <span class="highlight">economy</span> class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All the aircraft should be called Friendships, because we are almost sitting on one another’s laps in some of the cramped <span class="highlight">economy</span> seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travelling <span class="highlight">economy</span> class may have saved some small amount of money but it did not gain anything in upholding and maintaining the prestige of members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O ‘Byrne and  Senator Wood  referred to the fact that we have reverted from first class air travel to <span class="highlight">economy</span> air travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I have never complained about it and I have become accustomed to <span class="highlight">economy</span> air travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should consider the difference between the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the first class air fares for that few extra inches in the seating accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have, I believe, in recent times addressed a letter to the Minister for Transport,  Mr Nixon,  pointing out the damage which is being done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania and to the social and economic life generally of Tasmania as a consequence of these sorts of charges- freight charges and other charges which are applicable to our interstate communication systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time there is an increase in the interstate charges for passenger services or for freight it has a damaging effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has been elected to office at a time when the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is experiencing the results of its most serious setback in the post war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the economic vandalism of the past 3 years, inflation now threatens not only the future working of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> but the very structure of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as the great majority of Australians is well aware, there is no longer any alternative if our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and society are to be hauled back from the brink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That then, in brief, is the situation: If the facts were not beyond dispute it would be unbelievable that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> could have been brought to such a state in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 23 years prior to 1973 successive Liberal-Country Party governments consistently steered the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> along with a record, so far as inflation and unemployment are concerned, better than nearly all other economies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, the Government sees its task as that of slowly steering the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back onto the path of a firmly based recover)’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s productive capacity depends in part on its capital stock- the stock of plant, equipment, machinery, buildings, etc., built up by investment activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The several years of subdued investment activity which Australia has experienced have impaired the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s productive capacity in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this means in terms of the period ahead is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be able to accommodate, without strain, a much smaller expansion of demand than would otherwise have been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever is said about consumption or investment-led recoveries, the key point is that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> should not wait another year or more for private investment to begin to turn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures of 22 January were aimed at soaking up part of the excess liquidity in the financial system without sending the <span class="highlight">economy</span> once again into a tail-spin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said earlier, the prospects for renewed growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of job opportunities depend crucially on reining in inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point in time the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is rather delicately poised; there may very well be only a fine margin between a recovery which firms and strengthens and one which aborts early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The indisputable fact is that the recent 6.4 per cent increase in wages handed down by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been a severe setback to hopes of improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- to hopes of a continuing steady reduction in inflation, to hopes of business recovery, above all to hopes for more jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he explain how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Territory is to be maintained if the claim is true, given the fact that it depends so much on the viability of the building industry and the fact that 85 per cent of the work carried out by the industry is directly funded by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is both wise and sensible to have some reasonable growth in the money supply to allow the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to grow carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures mean that the community college is not able to cope with some of those teachers who wish to extend their training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government believed- I think we have been proved to be right- that that deficit had to be increased and additional government money had to be injected into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They claim that he is lynching the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us examine the Government’s priorities as regards the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government now says it will do this when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in the shape to enable it to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the answer is, not only the people generally but also the members of the Minister’s own Party, staunch Liberals, are becoming uneasy and are criticising him openly for his handling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are things which we should be looking at and the Government should be looking at when members of the Government make stupid statements saying that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is unsound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we have to have more money going around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under 3 years of Labor management the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation got into a mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be able to do that without wrecking the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before allowing for the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures, amounting to some $360m, it was estimated that a deficit of close to $3 billion in the Consolidated Revenue Fund was in prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which I made on behalf of  Mr Lynch  on the last sitting day before we rose for last week explained the need for a return on investment and the role of the investment allowance in bringing that about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As anybody would know, and the previous Government ought to have known very well, the managing of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that one is trying to get back to stability and to get to grow and produce extra results at the same time as one is reining in the excesses of deficit budgeting is not an easy exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, as  Senator McAuliffe  knows, begun to do what we can to rein in the deficit and its enlargement by being careful about expenditure programs and by trying to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving up once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the importance of the wool industry to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of many country towns and to the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people, will the Minister see that every effort is made for an early settlement of the dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prime objective of the Government’s national resources policy is to return resource development to its proper role in the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrants have brought with them many skills which constituteand I emphasise this point- a costless benefit to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are industries which, when compared with many secondary, professional and tertiary activities in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are in a peculiar circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in these times when the Government is professing that it is economising, this <span class="highlight">economy</span> could quite well be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think it has been characteristic of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> for a quite long time now that one of the substantial areas of cost increase that allowed itself to be examined with a view to making costs lower was the area of transport costs and handling charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister representing the Minister for Construction would be aware of the statements made by the Northern Territory Master Builders Association in which it is claimed that <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts in the Northern Territory civil works program are going to total $154m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would represent a net gain to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a gain in the efficiency of allocation of resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the Governor-General’s Speech is basically the outline of the Government’s plans for the future and in this GovernorGeneral’s Speech what the Government has done is outline its determination to grapple with the major problems facing Australia- the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in, I suppose, 2 very broad senses, inflation and unemployment, which we inherited after 3 years of disastrous, confused and muddleheaded government of our opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned a while ago that the GovernorGeneral’s Speech placed a great deal of emphasis on our plans to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember vividly that one of the theories being put forward by economists at that time as a means of dampening down the population explosion was that government should so arrange the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that it was necessary for just about every adult in our society to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their theory was to arrange the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that it would be just about impossible for a family to subsist on one wage and, by doing so, men and women would be discouraged from having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Bill providedand we have put into law- that the contribution of the woman in the home ought to be considered a contribution to the family <span class="highlight">economy</span> and ought to be considered as some sort of contribution to the assets of a family and, in the case of marital breakdown, a woman should have a claim as of right to have the assets assessed on the basis of the job that she has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It completely overlooked that basis of claim to property on the grounds of a contribution to the family’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we recognised in the Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It costs more because there are certain contributions that the woman is unlikely to be able to continue to make to the family <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think governments must find some way of making an equitable recognition of the contribution that women do make to their family <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thereby to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The supportive role of the second parent- in most cases it is the woman- is important for the family’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and we ought to recognise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry seen a newspaper report of the address by one  Mr John  Halfpenny, a member of the National Industrial Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, to an accounting convention in Melbourne yesterday, in which  Mr Halfpenny  reportedly said: ‘The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> had the support of a massive protection racket that would have turned Al Capone green with envy’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health able to say whether it is proposed to cut back on community health programs as part of the current <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that by following this course the Government at last will give evidence that it is genuinely concerned with the difficulties of those workers who have been made redundant by technological developments, those who are handicapped and those without skills in the advanced industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span> we have in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It reflects also the truth that if the wage indexation principle is applied in the strict manner in which the Commission has applied it there can be, as the Commission itself acknowledged, some problems in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to me a fundamental and important question concerning the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has been in office now nearly 3 months and it was going to do all these things to correct the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to stop unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that private enterprise- free competition- is the only area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that can rescue this country from the economicmess created by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that all these programs had failed, as had similar programs in both Russia and China- indicating the futility of legislation in trying to fix these problems and showing the dangers of government interference with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that a government which sees as an <span class="highlight">economy</span> measure the taking away of a basie public service like the public transport system in a community where there are very many people dependent on it is a government which is on the wrong tack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the first reason for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> steps being taken might be indicated by this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housing sector is the only area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is currently showing real strength, real growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision has ignored the fact that the building industry, especially the housing sector, not only bears the major burden of tight monetary policies in Australia but also is the key industry in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many times have we heard it said in parliaments and in general debates throughout the country that the prosperity of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be based upon the growth and development of the housing industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite should remember that if the building industry as a whole does not recover, then there is little hope of worthwhile recovery in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the desire of Government to ensure that necessary changes in the industry are brought about in a way that can be sustained by the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of funds for welfare housing was one of the major achievements in the changing of resource allocation in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor extravagances and recklessness, to do what  we can to  put this <span class="highlight">economy</span> on an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in the overall context of running that State <span class="highlight">economy</span> a series of cost disadvantages is set up it will be very difficult indeed for industry either to remain there or to be attracted there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some suggestions have been made, I think from the other side of the chamber, that we may be moving to a situation in which we are training more people than we can use in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In today’s circumstances, Japan represents a market that is fundamental to the development of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> today in Indonesia is possibly brighter than it has been for a long time or has ever been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary, therefore, that Indonesia should broaden her economic base and diversify her <span class="highlight">economy</span> if she is to develop as a trading nation and increase her trade not only with her neighbours in the region of South East Asia, including Australia, but also throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As time goes on and as we see the various 5-year plans which have been introduced and which are in operation in Indonesia, we hope that we will see an expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span> within Indonesia which will automatically parallel economic developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said earlier, if we can assist in the economic development of these countries to bring about a sound <span class="highlight">economy</span> and opportunity for people within those countries, we will find that economic development and, particularly, economic stability will assist greatly in the maintenance of political stability within those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry and it concerns the dispute between the Storemen and Packers Union and the wool selling brokers which is holding up the movement of wool, with disastrous results on the industry’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the private sector provides three out of every four jobs means the first casualties of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive are likely to be government or semi-government employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that these are the industries which, at least temporarily, are in greatest need in the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Action of that type played a considerable part in bringing about rapidly the sort of disintegration that this <span class="highlight">economy</span> suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Hume  (Mr Lusher)  informed the House of Representatives that rural industries- he used that term interchangeably with agricultural industries- represented the second largest force in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> behind the great mining industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 18 August 1975 the former Prime Minister announced the Government’s decision that as a special measure of expenditure restraint persons travelling at Government expense on internal domestic airlines would in future do so at <span class="highlight">economy</span> class rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) It was decided by the Government in December 1975 to maintain the decision of the previous Government that persons travelling at Government expense on internal domestic airlines should do so at <span class="highlight">economy</span> class rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to various publications put out by Professor Russell Mathews’ Research Institute on Federalism at the Australian National University regarding the effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of States either increasing or decreasing their taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask you,  Mr President,  whether in the light of the Government’s determination to take all possible steps to curtail expenditure and in particular to curtail overseas trips and in the light of the importance of the contacts and understanding obtained by members of this Parliament by the annual parliamentary delegation to other countries, will you discuss with the Prime Minister the possibility of arranging a parliamentary delegation to the Hutt River Province, thereby satisfying both the interests of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and international goodwill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party regard him not only as a fool but also as a hewer of wood and a drawer of water who is there to produce the underwrite the basic area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as cheaply as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be considered carefully by all who are interested in the problem of our rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is tied in with the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary, therefore, for a rural policy to emerge from the Government benches within 12 months as the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot afford the luxury of these  ad hoc  measures and an empirical approach to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which seems to be the basis on which the Government is acting in the totality of its economic management policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on this ground that the Opposition challenges the general line by which the Government parties have been endeavouring to bring about some stimulation of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I suppose that one ought to have realised that people who purport to hold the free enterprise system, the capitalist system or the market <span class="highlight">economy</span>- whatever they call itnearest and dearest seem to be chronically unable to grasp its fundamental principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry if members of the Government have not grasped that very fundamental principle of the free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> or market <span class="highlight">economy</span> which they purport to believe in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it is terribly important that Government senators understand this fundamental, basic, primary lesson in the operation of their free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>: Sensible farmers will continue to use superphosphate or any other fertiliser as long as the monetary return that they get from the use of that fertiliser covers the cost of the fertiliser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not typical of the response of rational farmers or indeed of farmers generally; nor is it the response of any person who has the faintest comprehension of the operations of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who say that governments must intervene in the market place in order to insulate producers from changes in the cost of any particular input are establishing, whether they recognise it or not, a case for central government control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although many of the objections which the Opposition raised in relation to the phosphate fertiliser subsidy- as to whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will operate as a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> or whether governments will continue to intervene and we will have strong and heavy-handed central government intervention and direction of resources into particular sections of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by means of central government and bureaucratic decision-are applicable to both of these pieces of legislation, the Opposition has decided not to oppose the nitrogenous fertiliser legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those who genuinely seek work, the Government is doing all that it can to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that they can obtain work and, in the meantime, is doing all that it can to cushion the effects of unemployment on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To assist those who are genuinely unemployed and who genuinely seek work we have an enormous responsibility both to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going so they can have work and in the meantime to look after them the best we can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, concerns the disastrous strike of storemen and packers over the handling of wool bales which has now proceeded for 5 weeks and which is affecting not only the producers of wool but also all areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> directly or indirectly connected with the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs by reminding him of the regrettably poor state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Tasmania where there is the lowest growth rate in Australia, the highest unemployment rate in Australia, the lowest average weekly earnings in Australia and, until recently forfeited to the Commonwealth, the worst rail services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to abolish funeral benefits is a decision which I feel was fed to the Government by the Department of Social Security when very necessary cuts in government spending were instituted by the present Government- cuts which would not have been necessary if the Labor Government had not stuffed up the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Government may have been incompetent and ruinous to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its socialistic policies deplorable, but at least it was not bloodsuckers of the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of us would wish that there were further increases and that better things were available in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the moment for the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a significant factor to be taken into account when the policy of the Government with regard to the management of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is being considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our policy is to endeavour to reduce the rate of inflation and to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by adjusting government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have enclosed herewith a copy of a letter sent to the General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission protesting against the cessation of the Adelaide Metropolitan Regional News following the <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures introduced by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the news which was broadcast to literally thousands of people and, needless to say that will now be sadly missed, was a victim of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts recently implemented by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter in the Senate because since the Parliament resumed for the autumn session much has been said about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts that have been instituted by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this is one area, together with many other areas, in which <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts should not have been made by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me turn to the reduction in the Commonwealth’s ability to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the State governments introduced their own taxes, the Commonwealth had less flexibility to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it reasonable to assume that the Liberal Party could maintain that control over the <span class="highlight">economy</span> if we were to see a responsibility transfer to the States of what will eventually become major areas of development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 find it incredible that a government which alleges that it has some knowledge of economic management, and which was so prepared to criticise the Labor Government because we were prepared to make commitments on expenditure which the Liberal Party claimed reflected our inability to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will make this commitment 8 years hence when in 3 years time we could have an over-heated, inflated <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He talked about a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> when in 3 years his government took this country from absolutely stable economics to the greatest mess - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that there would be  stability  of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> under federalism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wriedt  laid the ground on this motion  by  stating that there had been stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> under his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 3 years, with its claimed  stability  of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> under uniform taxation, this government of the past, this <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet  Senator Wriedt  has the gall to say that his Government created a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the system has required the States more and more to squeeze certain areas contrary to the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country and of those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Labor Party has been destroying the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and while it has been crying crocodile tears about how much it cares, it has been ripping off the pay packets of the little Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned, and I believe it should not be forgotten, that there is the possibility, and in some circumstances the probability, that there may well be rebates in the taxation field if an <span class="highlight">economy</span> succeeds, as we believe it will succeed, in developing a measure of productivity which will see an eradication of a high level of inflation, unemployment and industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such was the state of the nation in terms of the lack of public facilities and the very badly run down public sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> that it was essential at the outset to bring about some centralisation so that we could introduce essential decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the development of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has been described as capitalism has as one of its principal features in its developmental stage the bringing together of all the strands into a strong central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He supported the idea that the Commonwealth government had, under various provisions of the Constitution, legislative powers which could be exercised so as to affect the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> but that the powers collectively which the Parliament possessed did not permit the development of an integrated economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will be surrendering to six independent State Premiers the right to make decisions which will affect decision making about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has to be said time and again that we cannot rely upon the free marketing <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the way in which governments in the highly industrialised West have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an already difficult area to achieve national powers and coordination to duplicate the problems six times and leave the overall policy to be determined by narrow parochial interest as so often happens is to abdicate totally from involvement to the detriment of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in particular the rural communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not of itself solve the problems of the rural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not provide a much needed overall plan for the rural industries to take those industries as part of the overall Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> into the last quarter of the twentieth century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do feel that, in the course of the next few minutes, I should address a few words in relation to the wheat industry itself, its place in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the position of the wheat farmer who, quite obviously, is fairly basic to the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it can be seen that the industry has been of great significance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly to the primary industry <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that part which is related closely to it, that wheat prices have been high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of Australia’s proud record in medical research and the need to attract to Australia high quality medical teachers and research workers, and also in view of the parlous plight of Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, what is the current position regarding the availability of adequate funds for our various medical research programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister ensure that immediate and all steps are being taken by the Minister he represents to avert a further crisis in this important section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which, given certainty in the marketing and distribution of its products, appears to have a more buoyant future than it has had for some time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Free and fair competition is a basic tenet of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems to me to be a tragic irony that now that the economic prosperity has stopped and we are facing economic difficulties, it is not the people of my generation who have perhaps the wherewithal to defend themselves in a time of economic hardship who will suffer, it is the people who missed out all along the line who now appear to be the most direct victims of this Government’s attempts to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although there are still some sections of the Government which are prepared to make pensioners pay the price of the Government’s own clumsy attempts to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, no sections of the community are prepared to accept this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that there would not be a senator in this chamber who would not agree that if 5 per cent of an employee’s salary is taken in contributions the spouse- be it wife, mother or husband- shares in making those contributions by going without and often by going without in the area of personal <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Education is now very big business in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country, the total vote being 10 per cent of the Budget outlay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is trying to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to bring Australia back to a situation of growth and prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an obvious saving and <span class="highlight">economy</span> which ought to be able to be effected and which, I am sure, can be effected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I am acutely aware of the importance of transport and freight costs to the viability of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While <span class="highlight">economy</span> is necessary in a period of economic instability and all sectors must accept a share in such economies, the CECV would be most anxious if the strategies of the Schools Commission programs were altered in any major way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, sitting amongst the rubble of the shattered <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Opposition created when in government, has one member of the Opposition stood up and said: ‘I am sorry that we have 15 per cent of all school and college leavers last year without a job today as a result of our Government’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other savings would be made by <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures already announced concerning the general field of Public Service employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> class air fares between Perth and Brisbane were reduced from $174.30 to $168.40, and between Penh and Sydney from $ 1 42.80 to $ 1 36.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet it is suggested that it was because of our recognition of the needs concept for sewerage and the needs concept for local government that we were contributing to a downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to all the other ills which are shown up by the deficiencies in the present capital system faced by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that local government will understand that while the Government is trying to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on its feet and moving again, it too will have to pull its belt in, like all other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, once this Government is able to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on its feet, to get the nation producing again, and to get money into the coffers in order to support all public bodies such as local government authorities, then we will see this country go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was brought here in the first place in 1972 when $ 120m was injected into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by a panic-stricken Prime Minister and a panic-stricken government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, if they look back in history they will find that that was the first injection of money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface the question by pointing out that no doubt the Minister is aware that the tourist industry is an extremely important one to the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and is a large employer, particularly of females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am conscious that any increase in the cost of domestic travel has an effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania which depends very much on tourism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the repeated protestations of the Minister for Education that education will not be a victim of the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts, can he give an undertaking that the Government is prepared to continue the Labor Government’s policy of Commonwealth funding of tertiary education fees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By eliminating traffic hold-ups, there are major savings to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in reduced pollution, less fuel wasted in idling, fewer man-hours lost in delays and fewer intersection accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the major disruption to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> resulting from such stoppages and the hardship inflicted on those unfortunate Australians who rely exclusively on rail transport for urgent medical or hospital appointments, will the Minister take steps to prevent any similar stoppages which cause so much inconvenience, loss and hardship to so many Australians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be a matter of regret that some vital activities do suffer a necessity for cutback, but this must be done against the background that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was put into jeopardy by the former Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me to lend itself particularly well to that undertaking which would be quite important to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State and would perhaps over the years do something to redress the lack of opportunities in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provisions relating to the new investment allowance are the outstanding feature of the Bill, just as the allowance itself is an outstanding feature of the Government’s program for getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the move again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that the allowance will be directed towards investment that will have the greatest stimulatory effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, individual items of plant costing less than $500 will not be eligible for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that last year the Labor Governement found itself in a position in which it was necessary to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by means of additional government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason might be that businessmen know the effects of large government cuts in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not have the reactivating effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which all of us would like to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that in the August Budget we will see further cuts taking place which will further reduce the confidence of the business community which is a critical factor in reactivating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great difficulties created for the Government in the last 3 years of socialist government was the accelerating imbalance effect that the Labor Government’s policies had on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been women who have looked after children, who have made a real contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a diverse number of ways but who have never received proper recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proper that we should take the initiative because it seems to me that there is a desirability for the community at large to debate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the economic package which this Government suggests will cure all things in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we have been fed the story that all one has to do is shift resources from the public sector back to the private sector in order to get that essential stimulation within the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is a matter of regret that the Government has sought in the manner in which it has done simply to suggest, as Milton Friedman and some of the other bourgeois economists in the Western world have suggested, that all one has to do is to reduce the demand for wages and the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> will immediately begin to generate and produce the desired result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are confronted with an attempt by this Government to suggest that we need to help the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by simply getting some stimulation within the private sector and by endeavouring to produce some sort of arrangement, package or deal which the trade union movement will accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall impression that he tried to create from the point of view of the Australian public was that this package would, in fact, bring about the essential stimulation of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there is some last minute recognition by the Liberal and Country Party Government of poverty and it has taken some steps in the right direction in this economic package, the fact is that this action will not bring about that essential stimulus which is necessary in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because there are operating factors which are beyond the powers of” government, and certainly beyond the powers of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot believeand I am sure that a proper analysis ofthe economic package will reveal this fact- that transferring, for example, $ 100m which would otherwise be spent by the Australian Government into the pockets of 50 000 different consumers throughout Australia- those same dollars which would have been spent nationally in the social welfare program, the urban program or in the sewerage program, or by transferring those funds to a State for its health scheme- or by putting it into the pockets of 10 000, 20 000 or 50 000 individuals, will have any sort of stimulative effect on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In countries where that sort of philosophy and legislative follow-through has taken place we find economies which are in an even worse state than the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we have to look very carefully at the criteria upon which this Government seeks to build up its ideological position on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will exacerbate unemployment, inflation will not be curbed, and by the time the Budget comes down we will see the disastrous effects that the package will have upon the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one must say that the 2 greatest problems we are facing are the twin evils of inflation and unemployment which are stalking the nation and ravaging the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to such an extent that it is a matter of urgency for all of us to apply ourselves to the mammoth task of halting those evils and getting the country back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another important factor in the package deal proposed by this legislation, and that is that it will stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, our Government has the hope and expectation that these measures will stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be stated that there is no way in which the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> or any other <span class="highlight">economy</span> can survive without some form of contributory scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is more likely that the proposals contained in the Treasurer’s statement will have the opposite effect on the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the most important area which will be assisted by tax indexation is that of the stability of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, without the introduction of this procedure and this new practice we can see that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be slower to recover because the Government would be taking a larger share of the total cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this will be tremendously important as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picks up in the coming months when more skilled workers will be required for the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This reflects a waste of resources which we hope will be counteracted as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picks up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government came to office on the promise that it would manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Government claim that the new Medibank measure is an <span class="highlight">economy</span> measure, a measure which will reduce the cost of Government health services, when the Government cannot possibly know at this stage what its new measures will cost because it cannot possibly know how many people will stay in Medibank and how many people will opt out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the Government’s initiatives, the ACTU has agreed to take part in wide-ranging discussions with the Government on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with particular emphasis on wages policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a crisis situation exists it is necessary to go to the maximum of the safety factor to do what is really essential to curb inflation and to get the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> back into a sound position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is fully conscious of the fact that many speakers within the Labor Party, including some of their Treasurers, have said very clearly that excessive wage demands were causing great concern because they put inflationary pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, beat inflation and restore employment, no social welfare programs however great, no aid and no support system will have any real relevance because we will not be able to project into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe, in accordance with the acceptance by my party of the notion of a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which the health of the private sector is a pre-condition for the provision of services by the public sector, that the profit level, especially in the manufacturing section of our society, had sunk to a point where retained earnings were not sufficient to provide the necessary investment to preserve competitiveness and safeguard jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While patchy and uneven recovery is evident in some areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, future growth prospects are little clearer than they were a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is rather frightening about the nature of the statement in relation to the ABC, which one suspects reflects ideology rather than <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is that the Minister singled out the ABC and said that these cuts had to be made in particular areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Look, we took over the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation when it was at disaster level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned it is encumbent on the present Government to have another look at this part of an Australian industry which, over the years, has proved to be viable and able to produce something for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Sweden 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in private ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is indicative that no government knows how to handle the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and the sooner governments remove themselves from the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the happier people will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He mentioned that no government in the Western world, since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, has ever had such a regressive view of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or of the direction of social development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the broad question of economic policy it is at any time difficult to predict what sorts of policies will produce particular responses from an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The argument is that they should remain safe against all pressures by the indexation which is complete and which will make the first claim on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country to be paid to wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Research undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has shown that rapid domestic inflation and the structural shifts that have occurred in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in recent years have resulted in a potential decline in the competitive position of Australian wheatgrowers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Local Government Association has indicated to me that while it would have sought 2 per cent, it understands the circumstances of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> turned into chaos by previous bad government decisions which necessitate 1.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a report in the  Australian Financial Review  this morning which indicated that <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures now being widely canvassed within the Australian Broadcasting Commission include rationalisation of the Commission’s 6 orchestras, with the possible dismantling of the Hobart Symphony Orchestra and the possible elimination of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For my own part I await with interest to see the priority orders of decision-making and whether in fact the low priorities are given the first <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have seen over the last 3 years is often a fictitious increase brought about by a highly inflated <span class="highlight">economy</span>, pushing more and more taxpayers into higher and higher tax brackets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, as a major trading nation, has an important interest in a smoothly operating world <span class="highlight">economy</span> free of the economic upheavals which unfortunately have characterised the recent past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Well I think there could be argument about ‘dubious <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> rests a great deal on the basic stability of its primary industries which are subject to fluctuations in seasons, market hazard, disease and all those kinds of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a country that has, first of all, a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> with public and private sectors which are very much involved with each other, reacting to each other and dependent upon each others decisions and performances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The critical art of management in Australia is to be able to manage the mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to manage the federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One therefore must say this: If real progress is to be made in this country, if real achievement is to be gained and if living standards are to rise, there has to be a solid process of consultation between the public and private sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and between the various levels of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are concerned not only for the carriage of the freight but also for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and for the welfare of the employees who work on the north-south line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has achieved universal coverage, but at the expense of largely disregarding the need for <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency in overall health care expenditures by the individual and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides few incentives to <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the use of health services, either on the part of the consumer or, more particularly, on the part of the medical profession which has a key role in determining overall health costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that organisations will need to give much greater attention than in the past to <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency in their operations and to devising ways to keeping overall costs and contribution rates down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provision is included in the Bill to require a judicial manager, appointed by the Court, to conduct the affairs of the fund with the greatest <span class="highlight">economy</span> consistent with efficiency and to report to the Court, as soon as possible, as to the course of action to be taken in relation to the fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that this is one of the most fundamental, if not the most fundamental, industries in the context of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the freight costs are bearing heavily on the products of these industries, they are threatening the survival and development of our whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>; they are threatening the whole Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the problems that can be solved only by a realistic approach by employers and employees in this industry having a view to the extreme measure of responsibility that the industry must assume because of its basic significance to the whole Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of thing must be avoided if a measure of permanence and responsibility is to enter into the stevedoring industry, an industry which is absolutely basic to both the import and export sections of this great <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Imports and exports are of much greater significance in the Australian scene than they are probably in any other developed <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if this investment allowance could be justified at the present time, it is impossible to predict what the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be in two years or three years time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the allowance will be available at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is booming, at a time of very loose money supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Soviet Union has a trade balance of about $35 billion, twice the size but not very great in view of the vastness of its own <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These measures are intended to inject confidence into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by increasing consumer spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will have the effect of increasing unemployment in the construction and engineering industries, thus delaying a return in confidence and the recovery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that unless we can have legislation and decisions by the Government which will ensure that consumer demand will be increased effectively and that real wages will not be reduced effectively, it will be almost impossible for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to regain the degree of confidence which we all wish to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The promises for the introduction of the investment allowance have created a chaotic situation in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is, as is fully realised by honourable senators on this side of the chamber, that we must have a period when we get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving at the retail level, at the consumer level, in order to provide the impetus for investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth of the matter is that we need an investment led recovery to restore the growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that has been destroyed over the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that which will generate the full roaring growth which we hope to see in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the whole, I find that the remarks of Opposition senators in respect of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> continue to be damaging, irresponsible and without real appreciation of the serious problems which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has faced and from which it is in the process of emerging delicately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that they see their way clear to think through some of their own problems and to come up with some more constructive remarks about the future development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance that the Government attached to that particular policy was spelt out as recently as 6 May by the Treasurer in a Press release when he said that the allowance itself was an outstanding feature of the Government’s program for getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the move again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were, of course, and there still are very compelling theoretical reasons why this policy would not succeed in getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the move again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The spending on capital equipment will generate employment in the capital goods industries and, because of its multiplier effects, throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cutting back of construction programs in thc 1975-76 Budget compounded with the trimming of subsidies for welfare building, as anti-inflationary measures, can only have one effect on the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, unemployed resources.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposals which it incorporates have the following purposes: Firstly, to rectify weaknesses in the Aci regarding representation by the Minister of the public interest, in relation to appeals and references; secondly, to extend the present requirement that in Full Bench proceedings, the Commission must have regard to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effect of any award made, to include specifically the level of employment and inflation; thirdly, to make sure that every member of a union or employer organisation has a real opportunity to choose, without intimidation, who should conduct the affairs of the organisation; fourthly, to limit the term of office of office bearers of organisations to a maximum of 4 years; and, finally, to provide for the appointment of an additional judge of the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not need to emphasise the importance of the wage fixing principles enunciated by the Commission in relation to the general <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Act already requires a Full Bench of the Commission to have regard to the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effects of any award that might be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the Government’s initiatives, the ACTU has agreed to take part in wide ranging discussions with the Government on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with particular emphasis on wages policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although Medibank in its present form has serious weaknesses it has achieved universal coverage but at the expense of largely disregarding the need for <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency in overall health care and expenditures by individuals and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now who is talking about efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that we are talking about <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and efficiency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions know that that very large proportion of people in the community welcomed Medibank, welcomed its efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> and welcomed the fact that it took the terror out of being ill and took the terror out of having to pay excessive private health insurance funds, and because they care for their members and because they know that 74 per cent of the people of Australia want Medibank retained they are going in to bat for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This outcome is seen as constituting a ‘drag’ on the growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which may be desirable or otherwise, depending on the overall level of economic activity and the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to provide minimum growth in years 2 and 3, the guidelines ensure that the government of the day will be able to expand upon that growth year by year as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> widens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having achieved that, there will be a further 2 per cent real purchasing power growth for 1978, and on top of that a similar further growth in 1979, as well as the ability, if and when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> expands, to add more to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no specific training available to mothers, yet to become a competent mother I have found it necessary to study child psychology and education, elementary nursing and human physiology, cookery and nutrition, general housekeeping and domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, I think we should be looking to the time when indexation is no longer necessary because we have overcome inflation and we are living in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is much more stable than it has been in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have that stability in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the expectation of the future remaining less unpredictable than it has been in the past few years, we might then see women accepting responsibilities within the home for a period when they believe that their children can benefit from the full time attention that they can give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting to the Senate that the failure to appoint the second judge is a false <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the present situation- the failure to appoint that second Family Court judge -is a false <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is that this should not go so far, so fast, as to ignore the vital interdependence between the private sector and the public sector, or that public sector expenditures be reduced before the private sector becomes able to take up a correspondingly greater share of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He can base his appeal on something that a member had no right to take into consideration, unless he did so in considering the broad terms of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point to which the Minister referred relates to an amendment contained in the Bill which provides that in Full Bench proceedings the Commission must have regard to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effect of any award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can go right back to the period after the Second World War and follow through the basic wage cases, the margins cases and the national wage cases which took the place of basic wage cases, and one will find that in every one ofthe decisions in those cases the Commission has been asked by the Government and by the parties, be they employers or unions, to have regard to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every decision without exception, the Commission has said: ‘In considering the submissions, in arriving at our conclusions and in giving our decision we have had regard to the matters put to us about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, of course, the level of inflation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever part of a community or <span class="highlight">economy</span> one belongs to, the public interest must be more significant than any single or individual part of the community or the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many occasions on which the decisions of lesser tribunals may indeed prove to have significant flow-on or leap-frogging effects throughout the industrial area of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me to be important, indeed imperative, that a government as the ultimate organiser and co-ordinator of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> should have the right, indeed the obligation, to seek that any results and any recommendations of these tribunals, where considered necessary, should be referred to the full bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is nothing at all to stop those organisations from considering matters of employment, matters related to inflation and the general circumstances of an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what this legislation seeks to do, I suggest, is merely to emphasise the necessity of those organisations- those courts and commissionstaking into account a whole range of areas that relate to employment, inflation and other circumstances in the total <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the Government, as an elected legislator, has the right, and indeed, as I believe I said before, the obligation, to present on behalf of the people in the public interest all those attitudes and all those matters that are relevant to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which surely has to be taken into account in the final deliberations of these particular commissions or courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of extreme importance, particularly in those circumstances, that matters relating to employment and inflation in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be matters of which a court takes considerable notice in arriving at its decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with that view in mind that this legislation places such emphasis on the necessity to promote matters relevant to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in this case matters relevant to employment and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation will lead to the greater possibility, perhaps even the probability, of responsible compromise in this field of industrial relations which, as I said when I started to speak this afternoon, is probably more basic to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and consequently to the whole of Australian society than any other single matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While under section 28 the Commission has to take into consideration the <span class="highlight">economy</span> before making an award, the Bill seeks to include in consideration of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the requirement that the Commission- that is the Full Bench of the Commission- should take into consideration the effect of its decision on the level of employment and its effect on inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were to have a much tighter <span class="highlight">economy</span> and if General Motors-Holden’s Pty Ltd and the Broken Hill Pty Co.

    <p>That is the question ofthe intervention of the Government in terms of the public interest -in terms of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister, in the interests of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, suggest to his Queensland counterpart that the results of the State survey be made available to those with a legitimate research interest in the fisheries potential of the Torres Strait islands area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s assessment of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its strategy for recovery have been spelt out in detail to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance is directed also at increasing the productive capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> through the upgrading of the capital stock and in that sense does not discriminate between imported capital goods and those of domestic manufacture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister be prepared, in the interests of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to suggest to his Queensland counterpart that the State survey results be made available to those with a legitimate research interest in the fisheries potential of the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Have <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts in Public Service Departments resulted in an air of suspended animation; if so, is this due mainly to poor communication between the Government and the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board has instituted arrangements designed to monitor closely the effects of flexible hours trials in the Service to ensure that they are managed in a way that maximises efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is based on misconceptions of the needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the nature of demand and the appropriateness of the remedies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is known, we as an Opposition and, in fact, as a Government have always maintained that there is a need to ensure that demand is maintained at the maximum level possible in the community in order to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in particular the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been saying that as soon as it interfered with the prospect of the community being able to increase consumption there was obviously no chance of reactivating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The round-up of economic statistics for August 1976 placed great reliance on increases in retail sales, buoyant motor vehicle registrations and the level of private investment to justify the suggestion that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was picking up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government interepreted the increase in the number of registrations as a sign that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was starting to pick up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing this it failed to recognise that many sections of industry were dependent upon government activity in this area to take up the slack in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is substantial evidence that the real growth sector ofthe <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in the area of goods and services traditionally produced by the Government and not by the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition most certainly does not take the view that only by increasing the public sector can we restimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government is acting on the basis that only by assistance to the private sector and by completely neglecting the public sector can we hope to reactivate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These pressures will cause increasing conflict and uncertainty unless the Government adopted policies which enable the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to develop in a way which will allow those pressures to be absorbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that situation arises the policy of reliance upon growth in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> alone is likely to cause substantial disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even at the present time the business sector of the community is experiencing liquidity problems in many parts of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in many part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be considered an inducement to the business community to look forward with confidence, as the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for Industry and Commerce exhort the business community to do, but I cannot rationalise how that could be expected of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must know more about the needs and demands of modern society if we are going to regulate it to ensure that both the private and public sectors can work together and act together in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it came to consideration of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the joint communique- issued by everybody, not just by one person- stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The discussions traversed the present state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Government’s overall strategies and its assessment ofthe future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was common concern about the present problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and agreement on the fundamental objectives to be sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A tremendous number of people are out of work in the building industry in New South Wales, and that is one of the best barometers of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> had been shaken to its foundations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of unemployment and inflation which an <span class="highlight">economy</span> has to accept depends ultimately upon the degree of wage restraint that can be imposed upon and practised by trade unions and employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any country which wishes to see a growth in its <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be talking about exporting its products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2,  The Budget and the <span class="highlight">Economy</span>,  which accompanied the Budget Speech last night, did indicate the expected average level of employment during 1976 as showing an increase of 1 per cent or 2 per cent over the average level of employment last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken many initiatives to steer the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the path of firmly based recovery, and basic to such recovery is the need to curb inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we should be stressing our efforts to wind down further the rate of inflation as quickly as possible, to ensure that the process of economic recovery which is beginning is in no way thwarted and to reverse the more recent tendency for labour costs in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to increase more quickly than those of its major trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the election campaign in 1975 from 1 1 November to 13 December, the caretaker Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, said that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be maintained by spending on social security and that social security services, in particular, would be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meanwhile, unless appropriate economic measures are adopted now, the hopeful signs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could prove illusory, and inflation could take off again from its already high level, to a thoroughly destructive effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was saying his prayers for the much vaunted recovery in unemployment that the Liberal Party has talked about since November last year and for a recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which it has proclaimed and talked about since November last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the retention of the Regional Employment Development scheme, the present Government has no job creation programs at all, other than pathetic attempts to give mouth to mouth resuscitation to the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a positive example of the sorts of things we have been doing to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting of the same trend was also helped by different factors, such as the preparation for the conduct of the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the cessation of war in Vietnam by the U.S.A., war in Angola which had begun after the European Conference, large failures in the agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the U.S.S.R. which brought about massive purchases of grain from abroad, and other factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So here we have the Governor-General spending large amounts of the taxpayers’ money in flitting around Australia at a time when this Government comes in with its Budget and tells us that to bring about some stability in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country we must cut down on wage rates of the workers, we must exercise wage restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wage earners, the people who do the work in this great country of ours, are having preached to them all the time that wage restraint is the whole crux of getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on a stable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth, having itself initiated major economies to set the lead in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, nevertheless has been extremely generous to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commercial <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Territory is based almost solely on the production and export of copra that is grown on the Clunies Ross Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Home Island, which is the island occupied by  Mr Clunies  Ross and the Cocos Malay workers, is interwoven with and almost totally dependent upon that of the Clunies Ross Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there is the possibility that the legislation may be repealed or amended- remote though it is while the present managers are in control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government assumed office in December it began a detailed and thorough review of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of the administrative arrangements established for the carrying out of existing policies and programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Mission had the opportunity to observe the domination by  Mr Clunies  Ross of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> not only of Home Island but of most of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Free and fair competition is a basic tenet of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not some trade unions making excessive wage demands or a variety of other scapegoats who have been referred to in the last few days, why not the Trade Practices Commission as an excuse for the Government’s failure to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and hence the rumours which emanate about the Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reports from coastal stations have been deleted as an <span class="highlight">economy</span> measure, as I have said, progressively since October of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the drastic effect that a stoppage of this magnitude has on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly in regard to the control of inflation, will the Minister investigate the possibility of providing machinery within the arbitration system whereby on a universal industrial issue such as the 3 5 -hour week all workers affected, either directly or indirectly, by the proposed stoppage will have an opportunity of voting by secret ballot on whether or not the stoppage should be held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the gamble works the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country will be little better than it is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless appropriate measures are adopted now, the hopeful signs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could prove illusory, and inflation could take off again from its already high level to a thoroughly destructive one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attempt to subvert the concept of a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> led us to the parlous state this country reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has sought to rationalise its  interblending of human, capital and natural resources in such a way as to serve the interests of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the welfare of the people generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its Budget planning the Government has endeavoured to guide the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country in a way which combines economic, social and political factors and which takes into account our underlying philosophies of freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Government intends to set out on a deliberate path of dividing the Australian community, and to burden disproportionately the working people and the most vulnerable sections of our community with the cost of artificially stimulating the private profits sector of our mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has set about also to cut back public works and expenditure in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But prior to the submission by the unions to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the Government was attempting to say that the earlier judgments this year of the Commission were partly to blame for the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the incentives for investment and private spending the <span class="highlight">economy</span> had continued in a pre-recovery stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that the Chamber expected only a modest overall recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during 1976-77 and described the performance of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the last year as disappointing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these shortfalls will have a depressing effect upon an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which needs government assistance for stimulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will depress the rural communities similarly to the urban sector and will be a blight on the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is usually the habit of the Australian Labor Party to ridicule that sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He suggests, displaying some confidence in the Government, that in 9 months we should have got the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the track. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has promised the people of Australia that within 3 years the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will return to good health and the unemployment situation undoubtedly will improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Budget as a responsible document and as a document clearly designed to inject confidence back into the private sector, which of course is the productive element of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and was the part of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> that built the Australian nation to the state in which it was before the Labor Party took over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I am on the job I should finish what I started with  Senator Jessop  and mention what he said about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have in front of me many statements about how the retailers in generalthe people in business- are very concerned about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and inflation but more particularly about the growth in the rate of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even now the decline in jobs under our Government has been less than under the previous Labor Government, even after combining the private and public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in the other place  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  had much to say about a ‘mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>’ and the role of the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when he made a speech last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures for May for the financial year 1974-75, squarely in the middle of a Labor Government’s administration, indicate that jobs in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> increased by 91 000 whilst jobs in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> decreased by 146 000, resulting in a net loss in that period of 57 000 jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So work as they might at expanding the public sector and at extending this much vaunted mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> theory, the Labor Party <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it pours its scorn on a Budget which is attempting to bring some sanity into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The facts are that the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is crucial to the health of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means in real person’s terms that the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is crucial to people’s getting jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, in the small business sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> alone, the sector which employs 40 per cent of those Australians in employment in Australia, it is estimated that 3000 small businesses had to close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity for that sector of the community in particular to have the capacity to build up its capital investment, to strengthen its base and to strengthen our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, thereby giving more <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that Australia is suffering from wage inflation which is the basic cause of import competition which we are facing in every area of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment notwithstanding, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is showing every sign it has passed the bottom and has begun to recover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It describes those 2 areas as the keystone of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strong ideological kink to which I have referred is reflected in the obsessive disdain for public expenditure, which I will come back to in a moment, the fixation with the size of the deficit and the overpowering and totally unrequieted love for the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year at the time of the Hayden Budget, which was predicated on the basis of a steady consumer led recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the people of Australia were told by the then leader of the Opposition,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, that this was a totally false strategy to adopt and that a consumer led recovery was not desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good these sorts of lectures being given to us in the context of the undertakings which the present Government made about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might put it in these terms: There is absolutely no sign that any reduction in real activity by the Government in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will in any way be compensated for by an increase in activity in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First,  Mr Holt  allowed the Treasury to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and design the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally every Australian would hope that this does not occur, but virtually every Australian, perhaps with the exception of  Senator Walsh,  would realise that the problems that confront the traditional primary producing area in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today are related quite directly to several things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far above all these matters the problems that confront the Australian primary producing sector are related to a creation of the socialist government of the previous 3 years: They are closely related to the extraordinary measure of inflation that has grown from within our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in its years of socialist experiment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is a really constructive attempt to reduce the strain on our <span class="highlight">economy</span> of ever increasing wages and salaries, and undoubtedly that has been the basic cause of the inflation which has troubled us for the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In education we see a circumstance in which, in spite of the fairly tight guidelines in which we find ourselves as an <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the actual expenditure is up by 1 5.3 per cent and we are returning to triennial funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hear a lot from time to time about the revival of consumption expenditure and no doubt the ultimate revival of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> is dependent both on investment and consumer expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reasonable stability and a reasonable prospect of profit is essential if this <span class="highlight">economy</span> or any other <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to develop, is to grow and is to provide goods and services that of themselves provide employment across the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I further remind him that the strategy of the present Government, as announced since December 1975, is to cure unemployment by stimulating the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, at the same time cutting public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the effluxion of time halted my remarks some days ago I was supporting the Budget papers on various grounds because I believe they provide a sensible program aimed at restoring to this sadly troubled <span class="highlight">economy</span> a proper measure of balance between the public and the private sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I indicated that it was most remarkable that within 9 months a budget could be brought down which introduced so many features aimed at development and reform of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as this Budget proposes to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had further indicated the dramatic measure of change which was relevant to the child endowment policies and which must increase the stability and security of the family unit in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the land was taken, the Aboriginals’ spiritual links were shattered, their <span class="highlight">economy</span> broken, their ritual life ceased, the tribes were murdered and separated, leadership structures broken and, perhaps most devastating^ of all, the Aboriginal culture and being was systematically denigrated and ridiculed to later generations of blacks who knew too little of their own background to be able to withstand the mockery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Meanwhile the malaise in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be accentuated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Northern Territory as a whole depends on the viability of the building and construction industries as the largest employer of labour and the biggest consumer of a wide range of raw materials and manufactured goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thinking back to those wonderful little housekeeping homilies that we were treated to during the election campaign, I wonder whether the planners and the Government realise that a stitch in time does save nine and that there is a false <span class="highlight">economy</span> in their policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have more government expenditure to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I look to the reaction of the Premier of my State of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  who for so long and in so many ways saw fit to criticise and condemn the Fraser Government for the policies it was propounding and for the actions it was taking in an endeavour to get control of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This cancerous tax was eating away at the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why can they not see that the mining industry plays a very important part in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to recover, two inter-related matters, namely, inflation and unemployment must improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole economic situation gives cause for grave disquiet but in particular we are concerned with the present level of unemployment which touches not only the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no such thing in our view as a viable wages policy in a capitalist society- in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>- without a degree of consensus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These steps have been taken by the Government which is now pleased to announce a wages policy 9 months after its election in the context of a severe recession which is continuing; in the context of company profits which are well above the inflationary rate in respect of 83 per cent of companies which have published figures to date; in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is described by  Senator Durack  in the statement as precarious- and one might well ask whose responsibility is that in the context of the promises which have been made; and in the context of a declining level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that situation that the Government seeks to make the unions the scapegoat for its failure to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the scapegoat for its failure to keep its promises given in elections, the scapegoat for its continuing opposition to granting the Federal Parliament power over incomes and wages, and the scapegoat for its failure to deal with the incomes of people whose salaries and wages are not determined by boards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the context of those assumptions of responsibility that this Government took upon itself that, as I said, it now introduces a so-called wages policy which is nothing more than an attempt to rationalise failures- failures in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, failures in relation to industrial relations and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One suspects from time to time that the Government understands the failures in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, even though it lacks the capacity to do anything about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1975 election campaign we heard how they would cure all these ills and how they would rapidly restore the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The so-called great upturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not shown in the building industry- an area which the Government said that it would stimulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that supposed to be a sign of great improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed tough medicine and probably tougher than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> deserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall deal with some of these now in the context of the whole Austraiian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the state of the country both sociologically and economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to state at once that commencing with the speech of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  the theme has been that everything this Government is proposing for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is wrong and everything that the Labor Government did in its 3 years of office was right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investment allowance- the legislation in respect of which was passed in the autumn session of the Parliament- will also assist the private enterprise sector of the community and will help to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> has not provided new jobs for the 180 000 persons who go into the market this year, the school leavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">economy</span> must be stimulated to generate economic activity and to provide jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a greater level of Government activity has become necessary to sustain the rather slack overall activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It can only ensure prolonged stagnation in all sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now dealing with the results in a Budget which tries to stabilise a very unstable <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is dealing simply with a shop window <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The potential contraction caused in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Government’s actions will, it seems, disturb all sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be clearly understood in this chamber and around Australia that in the area which I see as being fundamental to social welfare, that is in the area of the health of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the restoration of full employment, the Government has done an enormous amount in the time which it has had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas bulk billing has proven its <span class="highlight">economy</span> and convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being done because the Government believes- to a certain extent, I think correctly believes- that one cannot continue to have public expenditure operating at a level beyond which the private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> can alford to maintain that public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that to operate a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> those people who engage in business have to have some reasonable expectation of profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes far beyond saying that from time to time a brake has to be applied to public expenditure within a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact they are using that slogan of the unfortunate Calvin Coolidge and his successor,  Mr Herbert  Hoover, that America’s business is business; that provided you have an unrestricted market <span class="highlight">economy</span> everything will work out for the best and that the market place is the best place to resolve all priorities and all needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That consequence resulted from the strange belief to which the Government seems to subscribe- that it can somehow turn back the clock, that it can act as if we were right back at the beginning of industrial civilisation and that it can decide that we are going to have a completely capitalist market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether one likes it or not, Australia is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deeply embedded in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country are public works activities- all sorts of activities by public departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all public expenditure and all public enterprise are to be in the form of paying out by way of pensions and hospital benefits, this will impose a burden of some sort on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During this period also there has been a vigorous debate about the role of education in our society, about the purposes of education and in particular about the appropriate relationship between education and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because Australia has an advanced industrial <span class="highlight">economy</span> and because the aspirations of our people demand it there is a need for a substantial share of the nation’s resources to be devoted to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Issues of major concern to this inquiry will include the coordination and rationalisation of existing types of post-secondary institutions, the relevance of new kinds of institutions and the capability of both existing and possible new structures for meeting the educational needs and preferences of the individual, the community and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some have argued that the existing pattern of education and training in Australia has led to bottlenecks in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- shortages of critical skills which inhibit the creation of job opportunities in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is getting results the Government says that he is disturbing the equilibrium of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that is a great <span class="highlight">economy</span> of effort and I suppose the amendment originated in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have no doubt that most of them have been heard by Ministers before but I record them because in regard to school leavers particularly, there will probably need to be some special extra measures while the <span class="highlight">economy</span> improves and unemployment is decreasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally true- I hope the Opposition understands this-that in Australia’s mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> about a quarter is government activity and about three-quarters is private activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to draw the Minister’s attention to the letter circulated by the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service describing the Government ‘s policy on Aboriginal grants as shortsighted <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact also that there was little improvement, if any, in the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister agree that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is far from improving and that all the statistics available indicate clearly that the public is far from convinced that it has reason to be confident in the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> following the presentation of the Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will pay actual fare costs based on <span class="highlight">economy</span> class travel associated with a person and his family exploring a prospective job in the new location and subsequently moving to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was again evidenced only yesterday in the very dispirited manner in which  Senator Cotton,  the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister representing the Treasurer in this place, delivered a speech to the Australian Retailers Association in which he confirmed the sentiments expressed only last week in a statement by the Government that the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s position is precarious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that was the first time that the Government admitted the precarious nature of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no attempt by the Government to lower interest rates, even though there is a slack in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and Government borrowing has been reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this is countering the stated intentions of the Government to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a highly opportune time now to provide services such as schools, roads and sewerage because those services can be obtained cheaply and they could stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For long term growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Government is relying almost exclusively on growth in consumption and investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likely that the real growth area in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is for goods and services traditionally produced by the Government, but the Government’s measures do not take these factors into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be fair to say that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is balanced on a knife’s edge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Government will recognise that the fact that it is wedded to a particular philosophy does not mean that that philosophy is what the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs or the Australian people need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the course which we followed in 1975 to bring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back to the maximum degree of economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, some of the problems that we see raised before us in regard to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally stem immediately from inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to quote just one remark in regard to the question of inflation from the September review of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by Syntec Economic Services Pty Ltd, which is perhaps one of the more sophisticated commentators on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Australia and which services businessmen in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government was accused- as I accuse this Government- of gross mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has led to an inflated unemployment situation without any great reduction in the inflation rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe, as  Mr Malcolm  Fraser believes, that one runs the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country as a strict housewife would run a household budget so that one does not spend any more than one earns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country has to be planned over a period of time and credit has to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present recession in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has severely hit the job potential for young Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I cannot see, in this day, in this society and in this type of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, how a person who is in the 16 to 1 8 years age group and is seeking a job can live on a lesser benefit than that on which other unemployed people can live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are led to believe that the whole problem associated with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country is related to deficit budgeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is true that, at the moment, the United States <span class="highlight">economy</span> is somewhat stagnant, its inflation rate has fallen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find myself denying completely the illogic of the Government speakers who suggested that everything wrong with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country is due to the fact that there was, as  Senator Missen  said, a 46 per cent increase in Government spending in the 3 years of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support entirely what  Mr Wentworth  and my colleague  Mr Hurford  have been saying about the need for some selective government spending in order to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An overwhelming proportion of Australia’s manufacturers consider the Budget introduced to the House of Representatives last month will do nothing to stimulate their business or the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in charge of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, and we are bringing our strategy to bear upon the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only did the Government fail to release the seasonally adjusted employment figures but it sought to draw comfort from the slight fall in the actual number of unemployed by saying that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was now under control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to place again on record that I believe that my colleagues have destroyed the claims of honourable senators opposite that this Liberal and National Country Party Government was capable of managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this great country to the extent where every Australian man, woman and child would have a fair share of the wealth of the nation; that this Government would create full employment; and that it would cure inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that there has been a campaign by the Government to mislead the public as to the nature of consequences of deficit financing and the detrimental effects on the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Budget strategy, this requires the screws to be kept on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by way of both fiscal and monetary policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one would deny at any stage of the debate that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not in a fragile state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we think of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> this Government had to pick up it is surprising that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has recovered as far as it has done so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shipbuilding industry has got itself into quite a mess, but this is a very good example of government interference in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is my way of referring to selective stimulatory government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, when taking over a wrecked <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Government had to take drastic steps to correct the excesses of the former Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has a remarkable inability to comprehend just what a deficit is and what effect it is likely to have upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, upon the money supply, upon inflation rates and upon economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I dread to think of the consequences that would have had on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is now only slowly recovering from the pounding it took from 1 972 to 1975 when those honourable senators who now sit opposite played fast and loose with our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual costs of administering the program were kept quite low but, suddenly, for reasons of political ideology rather than reasons of efficiency, <span class="highlight">economy</span> or community needs, we find that the system is fragmented with a range of unnecessary choices introduced by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been shown in other countries that any attempt to provide totally free services leads to a strain on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that no responsible government can be prepared to allow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt such stickers are printed and sported by those of our opponents who would like to see the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia ruined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ruining of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by way of the health scheme which has been shown to happen in almost every other country with such a scheme would have played right into the hands of those subversive people who would like to see the country ruined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medibank must be looked at in the light of <span class="highlight">economy</span> of scale and efficiency of operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now appears that our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is unable to afford such increases over a prolonged period, and unless costs are contained we will face severe restrictions in health care delivery and /or other public services- restrictions our nation should not tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they will have some involvement in understanding just how painful it is for the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> to bear the burden of hospital and medical costs and their continuous and endless escalation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the May changes, there were few incentives to <span class="highlight">economy</span> in use of the health services by users of those services or by the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use was made of the capacity of the stock exchange and the business people in Australia to sabotage the Labor Government to such an extent that the present Government is still suffering and feeling the repercussions of that undermining of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various proposals-some with larger effect than others- have been put to the Government from the Administrative Review Committee, and from other sources, which have been accepted as part of the Government’s ongoing objective of achieving <span class="highlight">economy</span> and effectiveness in its administrative arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view of the Fraser Government is that, in its first year in office, it should impose restraints in order to bring about an even balance in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we went out of government, as one of our speakers said in a debate on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this chamber a few weeks ago, the number of unemployed was decreasing; so was the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the record of the Labor Government during those 3 distressing and devastating years for this nation and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which led to a state of affairs with which the present Government is forced to grapple and which is causing the problems that we face today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the election campaign last year the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who was then the Leader of the Opposition, made it perfectly clear that it would take a period of time- in fact it would probably take a period of up to 3 years- to restore to a normal state the shattered <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we had inherited from the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">economy</span> can withstand that type of pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government needs to look at the possibility of easing the heavy taxes which have resulted in a drain on the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly in relation to the metal, manufacturing, electrical and building industries in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, the confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- which the Government espoused then and which it asserts today is coming back- is not evident to the businessman, particularly the small businessman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation today, whether the Government likes it or not, is much worse in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the community than it was 7 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The millions of additional dollars thai have poured into the coffers of the private health funds as from the first of this month as a direct result of Government policy could well be going into the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, towards increasing the spending power of people and could well be injected into the business community to create confidence all round. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of the matter is that unemployment has seriously increased in New South Wales since 20 May when the present Government introduced its mini-Budget- when it cut off the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and spelled ruin to the metal manufacturing industry, the steel industry and the building industry of our State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was only by the advent of World War II, with the stimulation of expenditure for survival- for justifiable reasons- that the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> was boosted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> we cannot be too rigid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now the chickens have come home to roost, and while hononourable senators opposite rear away from what they call a planned <span class="highlight">economy</span>, one of thenactions is like an albatross around their necks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we believe that the foundation we laid in providing incentives for the employment of apprentices and establishing the National Employment and Training scheme is what the Government belatedly is falling back on now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been built on 2 main things: Labour intensive operations and the export market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this <span class="highlight">economy</span> now we enjoy a rate of pay equal to the highest in the world- a higher proportion of women is working, there is a high standard of minimum pay rates and there is equal pay for women and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is a regrettable thing that, with the staff ceilings in the various <span class="highlight">economy</span> drives that the Government has felt necessary to put in train, these figures will not be available for up to 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>it fails to provide sufficient funds for selective stimulatory expenditure to revive the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we find ourselves with a package which is given to us today which frankly appears to me to be a definite attempt to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> flat on its back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of three disturbing reports relating to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which point to a failure of the 1976-77 Budget to alleviate economic problems in Australia in 3 respects: Firstly, the drop in capital expenditure plans by companies in the coming year which suggests an end to investment led recovery; secondly, the curtailment of the public works program; and thirdly, and importantly, the disturbing news from Europe which indicates that the low consumer spending rate, high unemployment, higher money rates and tighter control of the money supply are contributing to a further recession, despite the much heralded austerity measures introduced in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, can he provide an outline of what measures the Government intends to take to stop these socially disastrous trends in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a realistic and proper measure designed to implement practically and sensibly a moral obligation that has existed over many years to a small island with pecularities relating to a single item <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a society that has no indigenous population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that happens I take it that the island <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be maintained by indentured labour from Singapore and other places being paid again at a rate far lower than we should be paying anyone on an Australian territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Western Australia is the obvious place for Rhodesians, with the States rural and mining <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its heavy emphasis on development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I get back to  Senator Walters’  statement that her Government needs 3 years to put the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the rails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great deal depends upon the recovery rate of the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the buying power of the Japanese consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the basic <span class="highlight">economy</span> and at the basic economics of people endeavouring to solve their accommodation problem today it is clear that we must take into consideration that something like two-thirds of the Australian work force is receiving less than the average weekly earnings which are about $ 160 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Probably it would be true to say that today the building industry has the greatest percentage of unemployment in the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government still has a dogmatic, rather defiant attitude to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The professed concern for the Northern Territory by Government supporters carries little weight with territorians, particularly in view of the slashes in capital works and all of the other cutbacks that have been made allegedly in the name of reducing inflation and restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause (c) of the amendment reads: the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Prime Minister and this Government with policies which have caused a lack of confidence in this nation’s potential and created inflation and unemployment not experienced for 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For three years the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has suffered the shocks of rapid and unpredictable change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everybody agrees- the economists writing in the newspapers today agree- that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not as sound now as it was when we were in government It is nowhere near as sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We knew that it would not be easily gained when we were in government because we were faced with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that was set in train by the previous McMahon Budget and we had to cope with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were talking about spending this money to bolster the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All along the line when we analyse the supplementary policy statement of the Prime Minister which was headed ‘The <span class="highlight">Economy</span>’, and when we go right through it word by word, we find that practically everything he said he was going to do or promised he would do he has reneged on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one talks to some honourable senators opposite now confidentially they will say that perhaps they were a bit hasty; that with the way things are going in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, perhaps they should have waited for another year or two and then they might have got back into office by legitimate means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at what  Mr Fraser  had to say in his statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> prior to the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Premier of the smallest State in the Commonwealth he would know probably better than any other Premier the difficulties of maintaining employment in a comparatively small <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential problem and the reason why we in the Opposition feel a great sense of urgency in this whole question of unemployment is not only the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the loss of productivity, but also the effect on individuals who are caught in a period of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one likes to go right through the statistics it will be found that Tasmania has been brought to the stage of being the tail end Charlie of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from a document called  Tasmanian <span class="highlight">Economy</span> 1975-76  which was presented by the Honourable W. A. Neilson for the information of members of the Tasmanian Parliament on the occasion of the Budget 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to talk about what is in effect the Commonwealth Government’s approach of reducing the public sector expenditure and being able to create a little stability in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan was almost in conflict with the Government’s own statements on the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that Tasmania, with its very small <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the point of view of the total Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> with 3 per cent of the population and less than 3 per cent of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, was able to take steps which would not interfere in the national economic management plan of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also beyond doubt that what steps are taken in Tasmania are unlikely to have any severe repercussive effects on the rest of Australia, because Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is such a small part of the total <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of our country and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania in particular because Tasmania is the only State in which these restrictions apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> was discussed by  Senator Grimes  a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  remarks ranged over all facets of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Senator Walters,  together with  Senator Rae,  has taken the attitude that all of the ills of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and Tasmania are attributable to the present Premier of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been made clear over and over again by the Federal Government that this would run entirely counter to the strategy of the Budget which is a strategy of overall restraint on government expenditure and overall restraint on the activities of the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have time this afternoon to go through the various major steps that the Government has taken in this Budget in order to provide that stimulus for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but certainly it is a strategy which is already showing signs of working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter on which I want to wind up is the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only wonder why he enjoys such a wide audience in the Senate this evening because when the Senate was discussing the very important initiative that the Tasmanian Premier had taken in respect of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there were only 4 Government senators sitting in this place listening to that important debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite suggest that we should not have the right to use the proper forms of this House on a Wednesday to debate a matter of urgency, although the dismissal of the Government last year involved the question of government finance and the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia are concerned about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Premiers of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania have taken the initiative and have tried to do something about the very serious plight of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year when the Australian Labor Party was in government honourable senators opposite, the newspapers and the conservatives right throughout Australia said that the fault in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was due to the activities of the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, they were able to convince the majority of the people for the time being that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was the fault of the national Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It was an attempt, which is more than we are seeing from this Government which is still involved in rhetoric and making all sorts of ludicrous statements about the state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can give no credence to honourable senators opposite when they say that they were entitled to take the action they took a year ago to cut back on public spending, because in the present Budget the Government is spending more than we spent and there does not appear to be any recovery in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite will have noted the statements which have been cited many times in this place by the officials of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the statements made by other authoritative employer groups about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely they have seen the statements put out by the Australian Industries Development Association, which is probably one of the most important groups concerned with the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whom the Government is trying to convince, but the fact is that there is no revival in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to spend the remainder of the limited time available to me in talking about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has certainly taken no initiatives in this Budget or in this Appropriation Bill to bring about any attempt at revival within that sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those members of the National Country Party who are not asleep as a result of having a good dinner during the 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. break would agree with me that there is a very serious situation in the rural sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, even for those industries which hitherto had had some prospects of remaining viable and prosperous in a period of over-production on the world scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So nowhere can this Government justify the horrendous action that it set in motion 1 8 months ago to bring about the defeat of the Government based on either government expenditure or the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> a year after Government supporters brought about the coup is considerably worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how much rhetoric is practised by  Mr Fraser, Mr Lynch, Mr Sinclair  or any other Government spokesmen about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He told the Government 3 months ago of the critical state of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government strategy was to work in respect to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, if the purpose of that piece of regulation was to put money in pockets so that it could be spent in the market place, why is it not reflected in the market place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because there is a deep sickness in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the various sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, whether they be the rural or the manufacturing sectors, we see that there is no response to the rhetoric of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While all of those reports were on hand for governments and parliaments to examine what statements were made by the Ministers of this Government to show their hypocrisy and inability to understand the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have this inability by this Government to come to grips with the very grave economic problems that exist in this country- problems that are not the result of 3 years of Labor Government; problems that are structural problems based on the development of industry in Australia over 90 to 100 years; problems which the Industries Assistance Commission has repeatedly drawn to the attention of Governments with regard to what is needed to be done; problems that show that there are cyclical movements within sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the actions that the present Government took were justified because of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when in fact the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is worse now than it has been since the recession of 1 96 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is instituting policies that will institutionalise and make permanent in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> a large number- hundreds of thousands- of unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will become a permanent feature of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that unemployment will be an acceptable fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that throughout the Western world and throughout the industrial countries of the world there is this philosophical argument taking place in which the orthodox economists say that the way out of the difficulties of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to cut back public spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that an examination of the decline in the workforce in the rural sector and those involved in manufacturing industry and accepting the very great increase in the workforce in the tertiary sector- since the war it has risen from half of the workforce to two-thirds of the workforce- will show that it is in the service sector that there will be a stimulation of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the decayed <span class="highlight">economy</span> in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask whether this is another facet of the Government’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive or whether in the case of the Adelaide  Advertiser  it is because the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia,  Dr Tonkin,  has described the  Advertiser  as ‘ Dunstan ‘s Daily ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the facts as enunciated by  Senator Gietzelt  showing that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has not responded to that investment allowance program, is the Government intending to persist with its assumption that by the continuation of this investment allowance program there will be a response from the business community before demand picks up? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I advocate <span class="highlight">economy</span> I have these matters in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is my understanding that last year, when the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> suffered severely from Budget cuts under the previous Government, a lot of government works were slowed up, curtailed or cut out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Due to some peculiar concept of <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it is not impossible that in the event of an outbreak of fire at 2 o’clock in the morning the particular fire officer, who until now used to be completely specialised and would be in the control office at the entrance to the Concord Hospital- I believe that the Minister is aware of the geography of the hospital- could be on mortuary duty and a corpse may have to be moved in the early hours of the morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he recall that yesterday in answer to a question from me concerning the <span class="highlight">economy</span> he said that one can see the long term recovery trend clearly established and that one of the institutions he named as generally supporting that contention was that led by  Dr Ironmonger  in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country had better look out if the stevedoring industry is handed over to the monopoly power of one union and the conglomerate monopoly power of overseas shipowners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this Bill we have before us will help in the gradual process that we hope will permeate the unions to ensure that some responsibility returns to unions, that people will be encouraged to work harder and will be rewarded in a greater way for working harder, and in so doing will improve their own lot and help to restore the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sound health once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are signs the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is proceeding, but in the cross fire of political criticism and the pressures and impatience of sectional interests, the facts are often obscured, and the community could become bewildered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ABC has been treated in the same way as any other government department or statutory authority has in these <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasury told the Commonwealth that the Whitiam formula virtually ensured that over the longer term Commonwealth grants to the States would grow faster than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under those circumstances the Commonwealth ability to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be severely reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of this policy will further erode the effectiveness of these instruments and institutions and the Government will have difficulty in day to day management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will have little or no capacity to meet any economic crises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it was only after the planned <span class="highlight">economy</span> that was necessary to solve the problems of wartime that the Labor Party in this country determined that a planned <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that kind might work as well in peacetime as it did in wartime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was assumed, quite wrongly, that a planned <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is planned in a more or less laboratory type atmosphere, would still work in a peacetime circumstance where it has to contend in a free country with human nature itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been revealed time and again that this is not the circumstance; that there is not the luxury of freedom available to enable that sort of planned <span class="highlight">economy</span> to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Depending always of course on the circumstances of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we were restricted in our third year from continuing the rate of increased expenditure which we had commenced in the first and second years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the present economic situation employers are reluctant to take on apprentices, so that the number now in training will not cater for the demand for skilled tradesmen when an upward swing occurs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be an upturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at some time in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To some extent we are dealing in intangibles and there is always a question of whether education is for a vocation and is therefore related to income and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, or whether it is for some quality of life or just the enjoyment of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has asked that account be taken of the relationship between education and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the relationship between education and employment, and all of the groups in our society who require and deserve special educational opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures within the university have created some difficulties for the department, but many of these are being overcome through the more rational use of resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a major preoccupation in the years to come is going to be with output and productivity, then compensatory education can help by allowing a fuller use of the potential of under-privileged groups, pre-school education by freeing mothers for work, and recurrent education (whatever the short-run output losses) by making higher education more responsive to the needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and by spreading learning through a larger share of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps is the Government taking to see whether outside influences are being used to disrupt the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The high degree of interdependence of the productive enterprises in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> makes it very difficult to estimate the nature and extent of losses to industry as a whole as a result of strikes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Boeing 727 aircraft the fare differential between <span class="highlight">economy</span> and first class passengers operates in such a way that <span class="highlight">economy</span> class passengers subsidise first class travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fare differential represents a discount of 20 per cent for <span class="highlight">economy</span> class passengers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in a 727 aircraft with 6 seats per row, for every $100 of revenue per row collected in the first class section $ 120 is collected in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> class section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, first class passengers are entitled to perks to which <span class="highlight">economy</span> class passengers are not entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely there is no justifiable reason for <span class="highlight">economy</span> class passengers, who presumably are people on lower incomes or at least people paying their own fares which many first class passengers do not do, effectively to contribute more to airline revenue than first class passengers, who are either travelling at the expense of their employers or are people presumably with very much higher incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The industries in which there is the highest rate of injury are those which are most essential to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to remember that the Government claims that it is the private sector to which we must look for the recovery of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We  recommend  therefore that there shall be a department, which might be named the Department of Industries and the <span class="highlight">Economy</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initials would spell out the name DINDEC- having the capacity to concern itself mainly with the medium and long term aspects of the industrial structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and to act as the prime source of advice bearing on these aspects of economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Did the Treasurer last weekend on behalf of the Government, when announcing a currency devaluation of 1 7 per cent, state that Ministers and their departments are currently preparing forward estimates of expenditure for the next 3 years in the knowledge that the Government faces a long haul in restoring a better balance between the public and private sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that Ministers will be identifying further reductions in their existing programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether one likes it or not, the only way the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and full employment will be restored is by a shift back from the public sector to the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- When this Government came to office the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in the grip of its most serious post-war recession and inflation was still well into double digits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite unrealistic views were also fostered in the community about future incomes and the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sustain those incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expectations aroused by our predecessors have bedevilled the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to this day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even so, under the policies that have been pursued by this Government significant progress has been made in reducing the rate of inflation and in setting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on a path towards sustainable growth in output and activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also currently some fundamental differences in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> compared with a year ago which, taken together, point clearly in the direction of continued growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, as a result of these factors, and the moderation in the rate of inflation, many of the distortions inflicted on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during 1974-75 have begun to correct themselves; for example, business profitability has grown and the saving ratio has declined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing this the Commission greatly worsened a situation which was in no small way due to its previous decisions to increase wages at a rate beyond the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s capacity to absorb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead it will be kept under review and varied as appropriate in the context of overall management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new pattern of management of the exchange rate will enable more frequent, more timely and smaller adjustments to be made to the rate; is appropriate to the changing nature of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to Australia’s international trade relationship; is designed to avoid the build-up of and expectations of major changes at long intervals in the rate; will permit the use of the exchange rate as appropriate as a more flexible arm of policy; and will require little or no institutional changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The favourable effects of devaluation will therefore be allowed to work through the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in an appropriate domestic setting, by comparison with the former Government’s devaluation which was followed by a substantial easing of fiscal and monetary policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s measures have, undeniably, a number of major advantages for important sectors within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will restore balance between economic sectors, easing the burdens on those vital areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that depend on world markets for their livelihood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Uncertainty about the exchange rate has bedevilled many aspects of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in recent days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were putting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back into a position of real growth at the end of last year, and that growth continued on into the early months of 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is what the Government was about during its first year in office, namely seeking to control the flow of funds both into and out of Australia and in that way determining the overall liquidity rate in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The signposts in the total administration of the monetary package were, of course, the wage indexation cases and the effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of commodity price fluctuations overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously that has set the stage for further wage increases and further cost increases in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has come to rely on export industries, commodity prices have fallen very sharply in the last few weeks, and I mention particularly the prices of copper, tin, lead and zinc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see, as I mentioned earlier, that the credit squeeze which members of the ALP are now spouting about is dependent upon control of the liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the next 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned earlier, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is highly liquid and running well ahead of demands within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>under the policies that have been pursued by this Government significant progress has been made in reducing the rate of inflation and in setting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on a path towards sustainable growth in output and activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer had the audacity to claim that as a result of such statements by those 2 leading Australian Labor Party spokesmen on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the Government had been forced into devaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt,  in his 3 years in the Government that he represented, made no attempt whatsoever to move into the courts and to suggest that the wage structure of the country had in some real measure to be related to the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The best way to ensure that sort of thing, the best way to ensure lack of confidence in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is climbing out of the problems of the last 3 or 4 years, is to keep on making those irresponsible suggestions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the problems with academic economists, like a lot of other theorists, is that when their massive theories are cast loose into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, into society in general, where they no longer have applicable to them the atmosphere of the laboratory, they are completely meaningless and they break down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he did not say that when the Whitlam Government came to office, Australia’s overseas standing, its overseas credit, stood at an all time high and that confidence in this Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> was quite extraordinary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing that  Senator Walsh  failed to tell us- this is significant- is that in those few years of Labor Government, the export industries that earn these massive overseas credits enjoyed the highest prices that this <span class="highlight">economy</span> has ever known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the short and intermediate term, and ultimately with a proper measure of restraint and a proper flexibility of control of exchange value, and perhaps even with some reference to tariff levels, we believe that this measure will definitely help to move this <span class="highlight">economy</span> out of the problematic area to which it has sunk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as it does that, quite clearly it will be of significance to that industry and to the total <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet it has a cost structure that is totally and absolutely tied to the internal <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which it finds itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that as an answer to circumstances which have developed inside and outside this country, it is a real and responsible contribution to the development of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I freely concede that 1974 was a disastrous year in that it saw an increase of some 28 per cent in average wages, which is more than any modern <span class="highlight">economy</span> can possibly bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is appropriate to the changing nature of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to Australia’s international trade relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed it plays a very major part in that industry and in Queensland ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tourism adds to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and needs to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have regard for the horrendous decision made by the Government on Sunday in respect of devaluation of the Australian dollar and the pressures this will place upon the domestic sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly in the areas of credit and interest rates, this piece of legislation will prove to be very paltry indeed because in actual money terms it offers a paltry $ 10.4m more than last year or, for the benefit of those on the other side who are prepared to accept any piece of advice their Government may give them, a measly, miserable 3 per cent increase on the amount of money that was available in the last Labor Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is acceptable to honourable senators opposite all I can say is that they have no understanding of the tremendous pressures that exist within the Australian community in respect of housing assistance for those who are not able for a variety of reasons associated with the development of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the post-war years to save to buy land at the exorbitant price it is, particularly in the capital cities, and to finance the repayments when they build a home upon that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was all done in the name of saving the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- of reducing the deficit and of bringing down the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the building industry is healthy, so many of the other parts of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> flourish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that seating for non-smokers amounts to 50 per cent in <span class="highlight">economy</span> class and 40 per cent in first class in relation to Qantas, and between 30 per cent and 35 per cent in relation to Ansett and TAA, with Ansett being slightly less than TAA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, the many facets of this important and growing industry contribute to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> through: urban and rural development; decentralisation; new and expanded employment outlets; contribution to foreign exchange earnings; avenues for profitable short and long term investment; a contribution to education; new avenues for improving community health and welfare, both physical and mental; a deeper understanding of different cultural standards and community attitudes; a wider base for international understanding and goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we criticise the manner in which the Government has handled the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the past 12 months, as we have already indicated, there appeared to be a need for devaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stress that that is not and cannot be on while the current economic instability in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> persists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Queensland, and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, would have been in a far worse situation if the mining companies had not been able to get off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Major positive  results will accrue to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as desired by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly it is a matter of concern that the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not picking up as quickly as we would like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He mentioned it in relation to the confidence that was expressed by, I think,  Senator Martin,  in relation to new developments in the coal mining industry in Queensland- the Hail Creek, Norwich Park and Nebo projects-and said that there was little likelihood of their continuation because of the problems with the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact of the matter is that, despite the rather sluggish state of recovery in the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span>, new contracts for iron ore have been entered into by major Western Austraiian producers- Hamersley Iron, Mount Newman and Cliffs Western Australian Mining Co.- which it has been forecast will involve new investments of about $600m over the next couple of years involving the creation of about 3000 new jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the progressive increase in the demand position and the progressive concentration of that demand in the public sector contributed markedly to throwing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> well off balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We very rarely receive any credit for the fact that we set in motion the Industries Assistance Commission, which examines the various sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that were and are sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of food, fertilisers, veterinary supplies and so on are all increasing at present and despite the fact that people involved in the industry are Country Party people there is a lack of confidence in the current Government’s handling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is proper that the IAC should make recommendations about various sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but I find myself at variance with the Government’s attitude when it adopts some parts of.the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly a product of the same total belief in the free enterprise market <span class="highlight">economy</span> that impels the Prime Minister to fight tooth and claw against such arbitrary government intervention or interference with sections of the free market, such as tariffs and the payment of a superphosphate bounty, and also compels the Prime Minister to fight tooth and claw against any interference with the principle of tax neutrality- for example, investment allowances which subsidise the substitution of capital for labour or special tax deductions for life assurance which induce a much greater flow of  funds  into life assurance companies than would occur in a free market situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was obvious when one looked back at what happened over the previous three or four years with spiralling costs and the development of galloping inflation bringing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> into chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright expresses some scepticism about the figures I have just announced but he is not renowned for his knowledge of the details of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and needs of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all of its aspects- road, sea, rail and air- transport is a major component of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transport decisions have very important effects upon other industries and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because that Government did not do so, the present Administration has to take stock of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and put into perspective the areas of significance on which to spend the taxpayers’ money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time as these 2 propositions are being brought forward by the Government, the Government is considering a position of self-regulation in one of the most volatile industries that this country has ever known- in fact, one of the most volatile industries in any <span class="highlight">economy</span> developed to the level of sophistication of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe the reform will not come until we have looked at the whole system in a dispassionate way, with a view to <span class="highlight">economy</span> and with a view to efficiency of patient care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the previous Government took office there was, as we all recognise, a period of intense monetary activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> with an enormous increase in the money supply having taken place very rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said, they have been put up by people who obviously have a vested interest in destroying the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the rapid expansion of uranium mining, which is capital intensive, and mining generally, will have indirect detrimental effects on the employment prospects and existing jobs in the other 2 major sectors of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>- the rural and the manufacturing sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am endeavouring to draw to the attention of the Senate is the effect that the proposed move will have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be redirected from other sections of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly from manufacturing industry which at the moment is being systematically desmantled and shifted to parts of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative argument, which is partly moral and partly economic, has been put by those advocating uranium mining, the development of nuclear power, and a nuclear based <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the confusion in the minds of honourable  senators  and members of the public resulting from the fact that a little over a week ago the Australian dollar was devalued by 1  7Vi  per cent and has today been revalued by some 2 per cent, and in view of the fact that last week as a result of the devaluation a statement was made by the Treasurer pointing out the necessity, for Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, for the devaluation, will a similar statement now be made pointing out the necessity for the revaluation and what was wrong with the previous devaluation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising the advantages of the devaluation of the dollar to many Australian industries, and its assistance to the main industries of the Northern Territorypastoral, mining and tourism- and having in mind the degree of isolation and distance from markets which is felt by the Northern Territory communities, and also the fact that in the interests of the Darwin <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is essential to import directly from overseas, particularly such items as timber and cement, will the Government take action to ensure that home building and development within the commercial life of Darwin and the Northern Territory will not suffer through higher building costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have announced in relation to the tariff, should ensure that the competitive position of Australian industry is restored without unnecessarily adding to inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is related to the Minister’s answer that the Government is now restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to a healthy state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making some observations on the origin of this reference, there seems to be little doubt that this matter was referred to the Committee by the Senate as a result of reports that were circulating earlier this year suggesting that internal <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures under consideration at the time by the ABC would include the possible dismantling of some of the Commission’s six symphony orchestras. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it in another way, businesses are paying taxes out of what amounts to no more than paper profits and this has limited, and in many cases depressed, the general level of business activity within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be fair to say that if Tweedledum and Tweedledee were to be installed respectively as Prime Minister and Treasurer they could not improve upon the Government’s mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 12 months this Government has taken the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> from a state of recovery to a dramatic downturn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen it, by deliberate policy actions, bring about a downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, an increase in unemployment and a reduction in private investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been mainly because the Government has been determined to implement policies rapidly and far more quickly than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been able to adjust to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the tariff cut on black and white television sets is the only part of the cuts which will have any immediate effect and I do not think that is going to have much impact on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, much less restimulate confidence in the business sector of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want some evidence that it is a government that is prepared to help the business community and is prepared to give it confidence again to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that he look at the economic growth rate tor the 12 months ending December 1975 which is almost nil; look at the national accounts for the year ending June 1976 where the growth rate is clearly and discernibly established in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>; wait until the figures come out in December and see what the real trend line is; read the address of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia which was put out quite recently; and get away from reading the morning newspapers and the comments every day, every lunch time and every night from people who have, to say the least, a very incidental view of events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said before here that temperature taking of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its trends every day, morning, afternoon and night, is the most useful way I know to destroy it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done nothing but put the clock back and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(a) and (b) The former Departments of National Development and Minerals and Energy from time to time published forecasts of the demand for primary fuels in Australia, derived from surveys of present and planned fuel usage by the major energy consuming sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-88-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However at this stage the advantages of devaluation could be only temporary and the cost to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> of such a move unduly high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the distortions inflicted on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during 1974-75 are beginning to be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Higher government spending, larger deficits would do nothing whatever to correct the imbalances in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is running below full capacity, so the extra stimulus to domestic demand and employment will hopefully take up some of the spare capacity . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> rely on access to markets and therefore devaluation will be of very little assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (b) It is Government policy to encourage <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the use of energy, especially in regard to the conservation of our dwindling domestic oil reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The investment allowance, which provides a strong encouragement to business to re-equip and expand by investing in new productive plant, is designed to assist industry to become more efficient and productive, thereby lifting the level of activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and creating more jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government concede that throughout all sections of the Australian community there is deep concern at the worsening situation in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave- At this moment in the House of Representatives the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  is making a statement on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But apart from such dry technicalities as that, every reader of the daily Press is aware of the stream of improved company profits emerging in all sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am not suggesting continued buoyancy but rather, as I said, continuing moderate growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> taken as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reason for any failure to recognise the clear progress that has been made in 1976 in getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back onto a path of sustainable growth lies, I believe, in the widespread tendency to see that process only in terms of the statistics of those registered for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against the background of inevitability I have referred to, our decision at the end of November to vary the exchange rate also reflected a judgment that, valuable though an unchanged exchange rate had been throughout 1976 in cementing the totality of our anti-inflationary measures, the costs of retaining it in that role for any longer were becoming too high to be endured by those sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on whom the brunt of those costs was falling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key need is to ensure that the various forms of indexation operating within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today do not result in those direct price effects flowing on into further second round effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists and that insofar as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> would feel the effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The substantial progress we have made during 1976 in correcting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> ‘s course has hinged on the success we have had in combating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, combatting inflation is our major objective as success in this area is essential for any sustained recovery in employment and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday afternoon, on behalf of the Government and the Treasurer, I made a statement about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the details of which should be clear to everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally true to report that bad management of money supply- either too excessive or too restrictive- is very harmful in any well balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The continuing decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the failure of the Government to take remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ours is a country which will meet its people ‘s expectations only if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> continues to grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It greatly strengthened the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and gave us a much broader base on which to depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things come together to give hope for the future of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will give us an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is more stable and more productive, one in which there are far greater opportunities for Australians to get work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a matter of urgency because there is great concern around Australia about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great desire in Australia to see the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> grow and blossom and prosper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He concededthese were his words- that there was great concern around Australia at the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few million dollars floating around in Australia will not make one bit of difference to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its export earnings are in the vicinity of $ 1,000m per annum and are now 10 per cent of the visible export earnings of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this is taking place in the developing States, the States that are playing their part in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But more to the point, I think they point out that at this stage New South Wales, even with its large population, is the sick State of our Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> when it comes to employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without that development the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the last 4 or S years would have been in a far worse condition than it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must have further growth if the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to grow stronger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government, of course, was beset by problems similar to those of any government in that defence involves large expenditures on sophisticated equipment and there are always strong competing needs from every other sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the normal sense, the development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> would not allow otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The White Paper devotes considerable space to a discussion of the manpower, equipment and training that is necessary in the context of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to produce that capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">economy</span> certainly is a restraining influence on our capacity to build up our defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The continuing decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the failure of the Government to take remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition launches this urgency motion in an atmosphere in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country is adrift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any further mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could well bring about a disaster and cause the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sink altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a growing number of people in the community who are becoming aware of 3 essential factors: The Government s mismanagement is having increasingly disastrous consequences; the Government has totally lost control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; and the Government is speaking with a number of voices, none of which can be believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the Government has lost control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in November the Government called up statutory reserve deposits and lifted interest rates, putting a further brake on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at a time when stimulatory measures were needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until recently there were 2 views about the way the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will continue to be difficult for a long time in the future, it will be as a result of the actions of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuation of this course leaves the <span class="highlight">economy</span> completely in the hands of people who, very often, do not live here, nor do they share the interests of the citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasingly, interests of the larger companies will dictate the terms of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must maintain a proper balance between the various sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> rather than favouring one or two sectors at the expense of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we had had to look after for some 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always suggest to people, including myself, that when they read the daily newspapers or hire themselves somebody to tell them what to do with their money or how to borrow money from somebody, they should remember that the world is surrounded by economic pundits, subscriber newsletters, people commenting, and every day there is a new diet of advice on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to me there are other people who have had comments to make from time to time on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To add to that the Government has seen to it that it has a range of people who come together regularly to talk about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and various problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasury’s latest statement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 parts to the motion, namely, a continuing decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is manifestly rubbish, and ‘the failure of the Government to take remedial action’, which again is manifestly rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, in debating the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is endeavouring to bring before the Australian people the serious plight that faces so many sections of the Australian community and seeks to express a point of view in respect to the economic management policies pursued by this Government since it came to office some 15 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we will recall that the conservatives of this Government used the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as the basis for a great deal of the strategy and tactics to take office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, this document sets out to quote the Prime Minister of England who made a certain statement in respect to the problems facing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then he says that all of those people who talk and write about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> do a great deal to undermine public confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment, therefore, has become a permanent feature of all of those economies and, in particular, in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International capital now dominates our domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the real decisions affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are now being made by people in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people to whom I have just referred and important sections of the media, in the so-called interests of consumerism and efficiency, seek to further integrate the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> into the developing world economic pattern, to make Australia serve the interests of foreign capital and to make the ordinary people of Australia pay the piper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes in the Australian domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> in recent years have created grave structural problems in agriculture and manufacturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a recent Bureau of Agricultural Economics paper,  Dr Miller  has pointed out that the dramatic growth in the mining and tertiary sectors in Australia in the last decade or so has very severely distorted the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the economic base of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government’s strategy is to develop that sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report which was put out at the end of the year states:   it is essential for industry to know the Government’s policies and plans, by virtue of the fact that it is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in which the Government exerts a major influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They demonstrate that whilst they were managers of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for some 3 years, they brought Australia to a situation where Australia and its people were thrust into the greatest hardship that had ever been encountered in this country ‘s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the same tired old people who are still holding the reins of office purporting, as they did in the House of Representatives within the last day or so, to suggest to the present Government that its ways in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thrust behind that action by Labor was to bring about the ruination of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country would be wrecked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that  Senator Webster,  on his elevation to the Ministry as a sort of latter-day Faraday or Edison as Minister for Science, would have been able to adopt a more scientific approach to the problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which now beset us; but it appears that he has been so bemused by the difficulties facing us through the depredations of the water hyacinth that he has been unable to apply his mind to these topics and has had to give the same old speech as he used to give in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say something about the change that has taken place in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the past few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that as long as we have a business community and an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is largely a capitalist <span class="highlight">economy</span>, any sensible government nas to retain the confidence of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we found when such a debate was originated in the other place earlier this week, the debate is based on a faulty analysis of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would expect that the budgeted growth rate for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be exceeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is these things which lead the Government to say that there is an improvement in Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the things which have been said by Opposition speakers indicate an admission by them of the difficulties which they had when managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> throughout their term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do they show, in the policy which was presented by their shadow Treasurer, that they have any real understanding of the needs of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do they show that they have any interest in a wages policy or many of the things which are quite fundamental to the recovery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was stated earlier, if we look at the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was taken over in 1972 we will see that we had very little unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen how unemployment has rapidly increased during the Labor years and how difficult it is to reconstruct an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was weakened so gravely by that mismanagement during the 3-year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are hopeful that those steps which are being taken now and the steadiness which is showing forth in many of those sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which have been mentioned, will indicate that employment opportunities are improving and that the difficulties which we are now experiencing will be gradually overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation is the real difficulty in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion of the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Wriedt),  namely, that the continuing decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the failure of the Government to take remedial action is a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some respects I do not support it with any glee because the decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is affecting every person in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of urgency that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is continuing to decline and that the Government is failing to take the proper remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuing decline in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the failure of the Government to take remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even while the OECD mission was making these estimates- in that very month, in fact-Mr Whitlam was saying in a speech to the  Financial Times  <span class="highlight">Economy</span> Seminar in October: It is perfectly obvious that the present Budget strategy is failing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cotton  said, in effect, that the growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was up, inflation was coming down and that perhaps there was a little bit of a snag in relation to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wicked to attempt to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this was done only at the cost of bringing the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> almost to a standstill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who suggests anything about tax cuts is sabotaging the Government’s efforts to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into good order again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This merely illustrates that not only did the Government not know anything about the true nature of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also it was making bold, brash promises which it had no chance of fulfilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any prospect of an improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will go right out the window. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is either a gigantic bluff or a diversionary tactic- get yourself a scapegoat and people may not notice what a mess you are making of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- or it is a confession of bankruptcy by this Government in its attempt to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having no plan, having no program, having no clue about how to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it is now forced into seeking scapegoats and pushing towards a confrontation with one of the most important sectors of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the real problems that we face in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But shadow Treasurer Hurford has tried to indicate differently by claiming recently that the number of jobs which have been created in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last 12 months have been only approximately 10 000 whereas anybody with half a modicum of commonsense would realise that the school leavers from last year must have been absorbed into the work force to a very large degree if unemployment is still running at about the same level as it was in January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact statistics show that even though unemployment is still at about the same level as it was a year ago 70 000 jobs have been created in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and people have been absorbed into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look quickly at some of the indicators of improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> since we came to office on 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much also has been made of the illusory credit squeeze that is around the corner for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I stress that government expenditure is in more need of examination by an effective House of Parliament, so as to ensure the integrity of expenditure and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of expenditure, than ever before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like it or not, the fact remains that ours is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and that the private sector depends to a quite marked extent on Government contracts, large and smalt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than any other State, we have an interest in that improvement taking place without delay, because our State ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our people stand to gain most from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, in the short term there will be some security of government, some security in the effort which is being made to restore the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The further period of government without an election which comes as an optional extra from this referendum will be an additional help to the improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which we can expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to you that, in fact, it is curious, when members are elected to this place to deal with all the matters involved such as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the state of the nation, to find a candidate elected who has committed himself on only one issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Uganda’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in ruins, with such staples as salt, sugar and bread hoarded like gold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this reoriented thinking overseas on the fundamental problem of unemployment, and the release by the Australian Industries Development Association survey which found that employment will not meet the figure of 2 per cent increase predicted in the Budget, is the Government considering measures to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to provide the conditions for greater employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on the basis of <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the saving of manpower there is no defence against this Bill which seeks to provide for simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not want to go to the people on the vital issues that are affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- prices and incomes- but it will spend their money and create more inflation by going to the people separately with referenda proposals on these matters for purely political purposes, namely, to avoid the opinion of the people as it would be declared at a half Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning, the real issue is this: The Government admits by the introduction of this legislation that it cannot get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going again by the expected time of the half Senate election in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the national Parliament, there is one thing of which  Senator Button  ought to be aware if he is performing his national duty; that is, that the sheer size of our country tends to lead to a concentration of certain activities in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne for reasons of convenience and <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State, in terms of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, was not as soundly based then as it is now and the Federal Government’s policies had harmed the voters of the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the Labor record of rapid change and, as I have said, of handing out large sums of money to whomever asked for it, before the damage to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the unemployment were evident and while Labor’s true colours of socialism still had not been made apparent, the possibility existed that the people could have been fooled by that rogue Government because of its temporary popularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  said, the effect on the consumer price index of such once and for all influences as the health insurance changes has nothing to do with the underlying inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Bank’s latest edition of  Business Indicators  shows that following 2 years of near stagnation the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now making some mild expansion, and on present trends the improvement in non-farm production this financial year seems likely to exceed 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the true position is that the greater the co-operation between the private and public sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the forces of capital and labour, the quicker will be the recovery of economic stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote this passage be-, cause it epitomises the efforts of our Government to restore an efficient <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to move along the track which we commenced along when we were returned as the Government in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One often likes to think of the effect that such increases would have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> today in 1976 and 1 977 had those rural incomes gone on increasing at that rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February that figure had fallen to 252 000 but then the effect of this Government’s policies began to take hold of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a time of considerable difficulty, but the Government offered nothing by way of a program to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or to deal with the fundamental issues facing the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has experienced economic difficulties in recent years; my Government has given first priority to restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will use all the resources at its disposal to achieve this goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is not only taking action to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we produce we will not be able to get this <span class="highlight">economy</span> back to where it was prior to 1972 before its almost destruction by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance- I think that  Senator Bonner  referred to this statement- she said:   my Government has given first priority to restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will use all the resources at its disposal to achieve this goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program for the new session of the thirtieth Parliament reflects my Government’s determination to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and pursue the goal of social reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition he said: ‘A Government which understands and can manage the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is essential to Australian prosperity and to the revival of business confidence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget strategy that the present Government had exercised up to that time was based on a policy of reining in and tightening up on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, of asking the people and pleading with the public to tighten their belts, to ease up on the demands on government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in  a much worse condition today than it was 12 months ago but the Government still insists on cutting back vital public services even further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care how many times we remind the people of Australia that the 3 years of the socialist regime, before we took over, completely wrecked the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from inheriting a wrecked <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the Labor Government, we also have had to provide from revenue a considerable amount of money- something of the order of 25 per cent -for social welfare payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is the basis or the backbone of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been a series of cuts in a whole range of Labor policies which have affected not only the <span class="highlight">economy</span> within Australia but have also affected our overseas administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard  Senator Jessop  say in a speech here tonight that the people of this country knew from when the present Government was campaigning for Government that it would take this Government 3 years to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The several matters that are set out in the Queen’s Speech of yesterday do not touch just on the questions of inflation and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally which have been the chief issues which have pre-occupied us over the last year or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to pick up a few of the points that have been raised by  Senator Grimes  and also to refer to the practice that has developed in the Opposition, ever since it came into that state, over the last 12 or 15 months of constantly talking down the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great mistakes of the Whitlam Government was its failure to recognise during its period of office that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was changing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one celebrated member of the House of Representatives, my colleague  Mr Bert  Kelly, the honourable member for Wakefield in South Australia, has often said, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a bag of worms; it is moving and changing all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is that over the last few years we have seen increasing revenues pouring into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of our increasing exports of minerals and other primary products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the changes would have been recognised by any competent manager of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and indeed they were recognised during the period of the McMahon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is that it was too concerned at the time with seeking to milk the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to feed taxation revenues into more and more grandiose schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present coalition Government came into power, it justified the sleazy circumstances under which it seized power on the grounds that the Labor Government had allegedly mismanaged the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the consequences of that mismanagement were so disastrous and horrendous that anything could be justified which would install a competent team of economic managers in the government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Messner  displayed in one small area more perspicacity than most of his colleagues do when he was discussing the effects of growing mineral exports on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the pressures that had generated with structural change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Messner postulated that all the economic problems are due to Labor Party supporters who have been talking down the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Messner seems to think that it is the Labor Party’s fault-the Opposition’s fault- that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> refuses to respond to the expertise which is being brought to bear upon it by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it surprising that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> refuses to respond when the person who is making all the crucial economic decisions- I mean the Prime Minister- bewails the fact that machines are replacing men in industry, as he did in the House of Representatives 2 weeks ago, when his Government introduced, at massive cost to the revenue, a 40 per cent investment allowance designed to encourage precisely that and when his Government subsidises the substitution of capital for labour or, to put it in his terms, of machines for men and then deplores the fact that the very trend that the Government is encouraging at great cost to the revenue via the investment allowance is becoming apparent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet  Senator Messner  says that it is the Labor Party’s fault that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has failed to respond to the expertise which is being brought to bear upon it by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as well as that continuing pressure on farm incomes because of the cost-price squeeze- I will not go into the technical reasons why there is a cost-price squeeze- structural changes have occurred in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which have weakened the competitive position of Australian farmers vis-a-vis farmers in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes which have occurred already in the structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> have severely and adversely worsened the terms of trade of Australian farmers and those changes almost certainly are permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who - has the faintest idea of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> would realise that every sector is in perpetual competition with every other sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Farmers who ignore the new reality that the low farm incomes are caused by short term factors, in some cases the continuing cost price squeeze and, uniquely to Australia, substantial changes in the structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that occurred in the last decade, are headed for trouble, and politicians who encourage them to ignore them are as irresponsible and dangerous as the politicians who predicted in 1973 that demand for beef would rise so fast that we would be flat out trying to keep up with it and asserted that there was an urgent need to increase production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He attempted to quantify the magnitude of the change in the structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, agricultural and manufacturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard him talking down the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the extent that he can do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be very much talked down by  Senator Walsh,  but he tries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may be just the kind of adjustments you need in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the Labor Party would have had enough of using his statements of an academic nature, and of twisting them to try to find some solution to the economic problems which they have and which are not obviously solutions which will be necessary for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will gain anything by stopping mineral development in this country or its export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country is not so poor that we cannot outfit the staff of this Parliament in new uniforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All were assembled and waiting for the vital words which would indicate the Government’s policy for the ensuing session of Parliament, the policy of a government that was determined to rectify the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to improve unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only because of its <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive that the Fraser Government will not support these people in such a way as to enable them to continue on their farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive by this Commonwealth Government 8 soldier settlers have to get off the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that as the session goes on  Her  Majesty’s hopes that we will be able to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to pursue the goal of social reform will be more than fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly he identified the basic importance and character of primary industry in relation to the total Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the realm of primary industry itself I want to make the point this afternoon that I believe that the development and strength of the Australian wool industry is just as basic to the absolute balance of primary industry itself as primary industry is basic to the balance of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the tiniest variations in relation to that 1 5 per cent of the international trade that is referable to beef and wheat have quite gigantic effects on the market for those products in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably in that sort of circumstance alone lies the ultimate survival of the industries that have more to contribute, and probably have a greater potential, than any other section of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in some three or four years the Government has seen fit to go into the Arbitration Commission and argue a case which is relative to the capacity of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam,  in his 3 years in office, did not see fit to accept the responsibility of referring to the Arbitration Commission the problems of the capacity in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the wrecking of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Whitlam Government it was necessary to cut back on some expenditure last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some recovery in the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> in 1 976 and further progress is expected in the current yearalthough clearly there is a long way to go before inflation is brought under control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is such an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government which has been the Government now for more than 12 months, must accept responsibility for the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party was in government we pressed the point that the difficulties that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> faced were structural and were in some way related to the difficulties that overseas economies faced, especially the economies of our major trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely say to the Government that it must now accept responsibility for the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it must also look well below the surface problems which exist and consider the possibility that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has reached a position, after some 20 years, from which it cannot recover unless an in-depth investigation is made of the reasons for the failure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to recover from the last recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something is structurally wrong with the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the sooner the Government faces up to that and desists from using the old time methods to bring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into balance, the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dealing with the Queen’s Speech, it is obvious to all of us that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the paramount issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately for the Opposition, we have seen 12 months of the Government’s economic policies and I cannot help but feel that a parallel can be drawn with the period in the 1 930s leading up to World War II and the whole concept of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and how it would be operated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that from a socialist angle rearmament seemed a very high price to pay for a shot in the arm for our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators know as well as I do that whether it be West Germany or one of the Scandinavian countries, there is no stacking the deck when it comes to the wage index of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or for that matter, the national health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in terms of approvals, commencements and completions continued to show strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, documents like this Speech fail to grapple with the very serious problems that exist in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will further strengthen that movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Speech sets out the Government ‘s attitude towards the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and what the Government stands for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No initiatives undertaken by this Government will rectify those grave deficiencies within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doing that in the face of its philosophy that the only way to get this <span class="highlight">economy</span> going again is for people to spend more- to increase consumer spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>my Government has given first priority to restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will use all the resources at its disposal to achieve this goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows and accepts, although it was vehemently denied when Labor was in office, that the impediment to foreign investment and the development of our raw iron ore and coal projects was the state of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> at largethe worst recession since the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further interesting fact on this matter of overseas investmentI refer to this fact because this Government said that the only way we can get our <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving is to increase the rate of profits so that companies will expend their capital in developing Australian industry- emerges in an examination by Syntex on 7 February 1977 of foreign investment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It showed that foreign investment in the late 1 960s went most notably into the most dynamic, profitable and capital intensive areas of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that, as a result, in 1975-76, 55 per cent of company income is payable overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus too, the question of whether the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> resumes growth or shrinks into a smaller entity, with less opportunity for employment and living standard growth, rests in these overseas board-rooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two years after the Jackson report when there has not been a revival in the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> the problems in Australian industry are still acute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government in its own documents on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, debated in the Parliament a short time ago, pointed to the fact that profits had risen in Australia from $12.2 billion to $14.2 billion in the space of the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he spoke about the problems facing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this country he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in these circumstances we believe that the Queen’s Speech falls short of making a contribution towards a meaningful public debate about the state ofthe <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the state of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span> without migration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is futile to talk about decreasing the size of the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the private sector taking up the slack as if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country in 1977 was like a blancmange and if one side of it were pushed the other side would fall into position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that any government which raises budgetary expenditure to that degree in normal times- times during the Labor Government’s administration were normal, they were not times of war or of national outside emergencybecause of an ideological approach will dislocate our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That financial dislocation together with Ministers such as  Mr Cameron  urging the work force of Australia to go outside the arbitration system and get what it can by industrial bargaining is a combination which cannot fail to dislocate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall  talked about the dislocation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was brought about by the wages sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is not only taking action to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Queen’s Speech we read that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is to be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This unemployment has occurred under a government which indicated earlier, both in its campaign and in the first half of last financial year, that it would restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, reduce unemployment and bring harmony to this great Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The building of this national highway in South Australia would also enhance the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, I wish to deal briefly with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By any criteria the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now in a far worse shape than at any time during Labor’s administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should point out that the economic difficulties that were suffered by the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975 were largely the result of trends in the international market place and in the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the February figures, it was confidently expected that if this <span class="highlight">economy</span> were to be righted the number of jobless would drop by some 40 000, but in fact the number dropped by approximately 9000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only recently the spokesmen for business and commerce in Australia openly admitted that confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the future ofthe Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is at a very low ebb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the things I have pointed out tonight, I think that the Government’s record in industrial relations is almost as bad as its record on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In speaking to the Address-in-Reply I should like to say what a gracious occasion it was to have  Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth II presiding over this chamber and making a speech in which she delivered to us and the people of Australia what really amounted to an outline of what the Government proposes to do in certain respects, particularly in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It referred to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the remarks that I wish to address to the Senate on the subject of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is symptomatic of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the Territory at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us leave the building industry and look across at some of the traditional signs and indicators which have been used to assess the health of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann),  when describing the 1976-77 budget, said that it was one which would maintain the financial impetus of the Government’s objective to meet its continuing responsibility for the special needs and circumstances of the Territory where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is still heavily dependent on a wide range of Government expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has experienced economic difficulties in recent years; my Government has given first priority to restoring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will use all the resources at its disposal to achieve this goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all have a collective responsibility, as citizens of this country, to see what we can do to assist in getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I think that in endeavouring to revive the <span class="highlight">economy</span> we also must revive the old spirit of Australianism on which this country was developed by its pioneers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that that is good for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, for the country and in particular for the people involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It creates a vacuum and as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picks up the problems are just about as great as they were before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points out that a time of run-down training has to be maintained for when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picks up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also stated that the report from the Australian Apprenticeship Advisory Committee warned that a shortage of skilled workers would have serious long term effects on business and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister at last agree that the fall in the gross domestic product by 1.7 per cent confirms the view that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> under the present economic policies is stagnating? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he prepared to revise the Budget estimate of a 4 per cent real growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service, like all other departments, has been affected by staff cuts and staff ceilings introduced by the present Government in its <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outlook is considerably better today than it has been in the past few years during which time Japan’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been in an extremely hazardous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any person who studies what has happened in those countries as a result of the implementation of the green revolution will realise that the lifestyle and the agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of those countries have been upset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will turn agriculture in a section of the country into a one-crop <span class="highlight">economy</span> producing tomatoes, coffee or something else that will be exported to the well-fed developed world at a premium price which is very nice for those exporting it while, as I said before, thousands of people put off their farms have not even got the wherewithal to provide food for their own sustenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Bangladesh’s struggling <span class="highlight">economy</span> prospers or perishes at the mercy ofthe Ganges floods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crucial factor in recent years is structural change within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a miniscule number of exceptions, which are usually related to what economists call externalities, every sector of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> and every producer in every sector is in perpetual competition, which is a euphemism for economic conflict, with every other sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has a basic comprehension of the principles of the market <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a category which regrettably seems to exclude the most vociferous propagandists of the system, has always known that this is so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not be pleased simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not be pleased simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister advise why, at a time when the Government is trying to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, create more employment, make industry more competitive and capture export markets, there is a reduction in the investment allowance from taxable income of from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for all projects which cannot be guaranteed to be completed by mid- 1979? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 40 per cent rate is therefore directed towards investment which will have a stimulatory effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters which have been raised by many Ministers in the Government point to the difficulties in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the need to restrain government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am making the point that if we are automatically going to index everything that is subject to government subsidy the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not bear the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there have developed in the industry, firstly, freight demands that are very critical; secondly, internal production costs have dwarfed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this primary industry in comparison with the economies of other industries of Australia so as to reduce the apple and pear producer to a level of <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is not respectable from the point of view of parliamentary performance in relation to other strata of our people; thirdly, the industry is beset with unsurpassed marketing difficulties, accentuated by the probable advent of the United Kingdom into the European economic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that in recent times there has been an <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that connection, we ought to look at the background of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country when we came into power in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final point about the wisdom of having a President from Australia is that this would give the Australian community not only an additional interest in the Bank but also a realisation of what is involved with regard to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister indicate the extent of uranium deposits in that State and whether the development of such deposits will contribute to the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second point, that is, how could one claim that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is well on the way to recovery, the facts are there for those who want to observe them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that some 16 months ago when the Whitlam Goverment was swept from office by the judgment of the people, primarily because of its basic mishandling of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, industry and commerce were in ruins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 remind  Senator Sibraa,  if he needs an indicator, that what was negative growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the time of the Whitlam Government has now become positive and relatively significant growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that in the present state of the world, especially in the state of a depressed <span class="highlight">economy</span> like Australia ‘s, there is a great temptation to bewildered, despairing young men who have been extruded from any real activity in their own society, to grasp desperately at almost any straw to make themselves feel relevant and wanted in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What it needs is an impartial intervention at the international level to restore peace, to bring about a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to set up effective methods of self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was in line with the Government’s overall approach to the structure of the Commonwealth Public Service and the view that, to achieve greater efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the number of commissions and other statutory bodies should be minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a rich <span class="highlight">economy</span> most of whose neighbours are developing nations with low per capita incomes, high population growth rates, foreign exchange problems and huge debt burdens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reintegration of the Australian Development Assistance Agency as the Australian Development Assistance Bureau within the Department of Foreign Affairs will ensure increased <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the administration of our aid and improve co-ordination of development assistance policy with foreign policy generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the timing of elements of the overall development scheme, the need to establish an economic justification for each step particularly in relation to the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is Government policy to encourage <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the use of energy, especially in regard to the conservation of our dwindling domestic oil reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It relates to the general state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister in his election policy speech 18 months ago state that a government which understands and can manage the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is essential to Australian prosperity and to the revival of business confidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that since this Government assumed office it has done nothing but take a series of  ad hoc  economic decisions which, to say the least, have put the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> on a most erratic and uncertain course, thus adding greatly to the lack of business confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals cannot be regarded as a panacea for the problems besetting the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- far from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A whole series of authorities in recent years, particularly in the last 10 years, have pointed out how the unions having this monopolistic power to dislocate industry under the name of what  Senator Harradine  referred to as the right to strike and, presumably since he objects to the Trade Practices Bill, the right to employ secondary boycotts in enforcement of the right to strike, claim the right to dislocate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country to the great injury of other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was  Mr Whitlam  no less who in the last year of his Government was forced to admit that the union abuse of power was the crippling feature of his effort to regain stability in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pressure which that exerted upon particular sections of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was one of the chief forces that was artificially creating the upsurge in the price level which is, of course, inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is because the unions add to their legitimate union strength and force the other coercive effort to call a strike or secondary boycott and dislocate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and artificially create an upsurge in what their opponents are prepared to yield rather than have that dislocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are largely avoiding for some reason or other the fact that a tax cut is already significantly built into this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists and that insofar as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more important and much more sinister considerations, I think, are what I describe as the covert acts of this Government which certainly impede and prejudice any likelihood of the sort of cooperation which is critically essential for the establishment of relationships between the 2 major ingredients in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> which would enable capital and labour to find a way through the economic morass in which this country finds itself at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, the freeze has never been seen as an economic exercise but as an exercise in transferring the blame for the inevitable deterioration in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from the Government to the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then argues that the application of the technologies of developed countries to these situations usually results in what is referred to as a dual <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which only a small elite benefit and the masses do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the strike or ban in South Australia continues and endangers the functioning of essential services as well as affecting adversely the jobs of innocent and conscientious workers, will the Government declare a state of emergency to make sure that crude oil will be delivered to the refinery so that the welfare of innocent people will not be placed in jeopardy by a few radicals who seem to have no concern for either the welfare of the community or the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this Government came to office giving the impression that it would be the saviour of the manufacturing industry and, indeed, of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government believes that there has been a turn-around in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it ought to consider documents- incidentally, they are not newspaper articles- which indicate quite clearly that there is a deep malaise in the manufacturing sector and, indeed, across the whole business community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They establish the fact that at the present time the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a very drastic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A basic problem in considering the underlying direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the uneven performance between major sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Important areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are still near recession levels or exhibiting very little momentum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that day the Government announced the first of what could be described as a series of  ad hoc  measures concerning the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and announced also that a Bureau of Industry Economics would be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manufacturing in this country constitutes a very important part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who thinks there is any great joy in taking over an <span class="highlight">economy</span> rampant with high inflation and high unemployment and in trying to fix it is making a great mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed for certainty in manufacturing industry- this may be agreed to by all of us- is a position in which a government can indicate in a White Paper on a consistent position, a sensible position, a workable position through time for that sector of Australia within the overall <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia, for that to be, as far as possible, carefully done, thoughtfully done, not hastily done, and for that to be, as far as possible, a bipartisan approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They need to get their state of understanding and their state of confidence from a confident <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a well run <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that in due course they will say ‘Everybody regards this as the fact’, not ‘Everybody regards this as a matter for argument for difference of opinion, and a matter on which we ought generally to be chopping each other about’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic growth that is now occurring and the reinvestment that is now occurring will, in due course, produce the solutions to those problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> with which we are confronted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We asked the IAC to consider particularly in its future reports the method and level of tariff and other assistance necessary to protect industry against import competition; whether industry could be made more efficient; the basis forjudging that efficiency; the possible improvements in it; the level of tariff assistance that this would require; whether restructuring was called for; if so, how this could be done; whether industry was less efficient than it could be due to fragmentation, insufficient specialisation or restrictions; and the consequences to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to the social fabric and to employment of changing the levels of tariff assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we try to do in the White Paper is to say what will be the broad shape of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, how its employment characteristics will move, how we will look to maximise the opportunities of the people of Australia, what the best way is to look after those people and to help them to do the best possible job for themselves and their country, what should be our balance of trade position and the balance of local opportunity, how we should best add value to the natural raw materials we find or grow them in the ground, and how to maximise the opportunities for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They rely to a very great extent on the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, on the construction of roads, bridges, railway lines, railway carriages and rolling stock, pipelines and sewerage lines, all of which construction has been cut seriously as a direct result of this Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even that is generating confidence within the manufacturing sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all in all we have a situation in which the Government, firstly, had to find out what sort of a mess the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in and, secondly, had to devise policies to remedy it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I finish my remarks by again pointing out to the Senate that although this motion of itself is of no value, I am glad to have been able to speak to it and to give people an opportunity to understand what the Government has been able to achieve during its relatively short period in office in the area of manufacturing industry and, in fact, in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quite obvious to anybody who read between the lines that there was a fundamental brawl going on, not only in the Government Parties but also in the bureaucracy, on the vexed question of tariff policy which is at the heart of the future not only of manufacturing industry in this country but also of our entire <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manufacturing industry has further been hampered by bad working conditions, by its small scale- its smallness on the domestic market- and the Jackson Committee pointed out that there has been needless duplication of plant, there has not been any of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of scale and it must become internationally competitive and become an exporter so that it can burst out of the straitjacket of the constricted local market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I do not think that anybody can possibly query the claim that the Government’s main responsibility regarding the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present is to deal with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to provide Government measures that would give a great impetus to business at the moment out of balance to and failing to recognise the needs of the rest of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we would suffer again the worst surges of inflation as we did in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is very much a moving target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, we need improved productivity, better work distribution, the easing of inflation and greater investment to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back to where we would like it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not functioning well- the Government is still trying to bring it out of its most serious post-war recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Real growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is so low, if present at all, that it can no longer be considered the springboard for sustained economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it is essential for industry to know the Government’s policies and plans, by virtue of the fact that it is a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in which the Government exerts a major influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the Fraser Administration which used the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as the excuse to develop its campaign to destroy the Whitlam Government is having no success in its endeavours to develop a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its failure to produce a report on manufacturing industry, and its failure to achieve any worthwhile success on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in relation to wages and prices is an indication of its inability to develop properly an alternative strategy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the inability of this Government to make any fundamental review of the nature of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the problems besetting manufacturing industry and the divisions that therefore exist within the Government are the reasons why the report on manufacturing industry has not yet been dealt with and placed before the Australian Parliament and the Australian community for a public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think any honourable senator would disagree with me about the difficulties that face the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as distinct from the general malady that faces countries in which capital is the predominant force on the world scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we still hear Government members suggesting that those factors should be set aside and that we should have a development of our mineral resources, as if that would provide us with the wherewithal to bring about some resurgence in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Messner  obviously has not read the Industries Assistance Commission report dealing with the problems associated with the change in the structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sits back and allows its  Deputy  Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony),  to go on a world tour and suggest the way forward as far as the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is concerned is to stimulate income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that all we have to do is reduce real wages and, when we have done that, there will be no further problems within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know we must look forward and not backwards to any great extent but I only wish that the previous Government in 1972 had thought about establishing a committee to give it a bit of advice on the realities of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and on the need to give assistance to industry rather than leaving it until 1974 when, as I have just shown from the figures I have cited, the damage was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to mention two more which have had very beneficial effects upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally and upon industry in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is going through some very painful adjustment processes, especially in the motor vehicle industry and at a time when industrial disputes have been reduced substantially, the action by General Motors is not to be treated lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He knows that in 1975 the <span class="highlight">economy</span> went downhill; in 1976 it climbed; it is climbing still. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A new investment of at least $370m has been announced in the last 12 months, including an investment of $150m by General MotorsHolden ‘s and we are due to see more announcements of new investment in the future from people who obviously are prepared to back themselves down the long haul as this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> gets better and better, as it certainly will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a market society; it is a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what is expected is that everybody be guaranteed by the Government to do well all the time in respect of everything they do, I do not think we would have a free market <span class="highlight">economy</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a prospect that in due course from this position, by creating a stable base in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to ensure growth again and by getting cost competitiveness back into the scene through the investment programs and general restraints, we will get back into the export market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will best be resolved in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is stable and growing, and with a cost structure in the industry which is realistic so that Australia can get back on its feet and once again have a bigger market, much of which will have to be in exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally the operators in that free society, that market <span class="highlight">economy</span>, have to take their risks if they want their opportunities and abilities realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said,  Senator Cotton  referred to the free market <span class="highlight">economy</span>- ‘private enterprise’ as it is sometimes called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the desire of the Government to ensure that necessary changes in the industry are brought about in a way that can be sustained by the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise in this debate because I am concerned not only with the present issue of a week ‘s stand-down of” workers by the management of General Motors-Holden ‘s Pty Ltd but also with the practices of the multi-national companies throughout the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find myself in complete agreement with an increasing number of spokesmen of farm organisations who believe that the future of agriculture in Australia depends upon a prosperous domestic market, recognising as they do that about 50 per cent of all that we produce is consumed on the domestic market and that any downturn in any sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> therefore affects the prosperity not only of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> but the rural sector in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a need for full employment and a prosperous <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the greater part of the present economic ills facing this country arose from the unrestricted, unsupervised and unknown activities of the multi-national corporations in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my contribution today I intend to look at both the immediate issue at hand and the role of one of those multi-nationals- GM-H- in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by the Treasurer,  Mr Lynch,  to the effect that sales cuts are ‘not on ‘ is again an example of intransigence and a failure to initiate action to improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to prevent loss of jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This expansion of foreign ownership increases the now generally recognised trend for more and more decisions affecting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to be made in the boardrooms of New York, Tokyo, London and other capitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has, along with other motor industries in Australia, made a big contribution to this country particularly in the areas of employment and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a South Australian I ask: How much is my own State leaning upon the motor industry for employment and for its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to talk down the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but the reason that fewer people are buying cars is that fewer people have any confidence that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will pick up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The indicators show an upturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very competitive field and one in which a company has to be on the alert in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> like we have in Australia with high labour costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now you can get <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the equipment of imported cars, plus exceptional handling . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also find honourable senators opposite always claiming that we will not get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country back on to an even keel until we increase productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite are always telling us how they have been able to bring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country back to an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many major projects of vital importance to the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and development would have to be deferred or slowed down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we see that the Premier, who on 28 February stated that unless more money was obtained many major projects of vital importance to the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and development would have to be deferred or slowed down, concluded a deal to spend less and then had the audacity to claim that as a victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I question whether the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will permit further assistance to this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also an area in which one could quote a whole range of statistics to indicate the significance and the involvement of insurance generally in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government and I have been saying for quite a long time is equally truethat the last point of recovery in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that has been flattened is to get employment back to reasonable levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each person, in his or her lifetime, contributes to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> a very much greater sum by way of tax and by way of other payments to the national purse than that person is ever likely to take out in the declining years of his or her life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government’s incapacity to deal adequately with the situation is not confined specifically to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> only; I think it can be said of virtually any area of public activity which comes under the national Government s jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government attaches great importance to the role which manufacturing industry has played and will continue to play in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a strong and complex interdependence between manufacturing and other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manufacturing industry constitutes an important part of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is, however, conscious of the problems which short term measures directed towards a particular industry can create elsewhere in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and will exercise the closest possible control over such policies, including limitations as to their duration, consistent with the objective of minimising disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These policies will form part of a broader framework of policies aimed at fostering the growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole so as to create a climate in which new opportunities will exist for business initiatives and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The build-up given to it after the very extensive work done by the Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry- the Jackson Committeewhich, of course, was initiated by the Labor Government, has led manufacturing industry and other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to expect a well reasoned document containing some substantial and specific recommendations about the future of Australian manufacturing industry and about the policies which the present Government will devise for that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under existing income tax rules, businesses are paying taxes out of what amounts to no more than paper profits and this has limited, and in many cases depressed, the general level of business activity within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Re-introduction of the instalment system will contribute towards evening out swings in liquidity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> within any financial year and thereby add to the effectiveness of monetary management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was one of the Government’s first <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small businesses also make up important segments of other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly in the commerce area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason why we emphatically want to balance the <span class="highlight">economy</span> here as between the public and the private sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a significant and for the most part new initiative in developing the national capital of Australia and diversifying and strengthening its <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That of course is the sort of measure to which I was just referring, and I think it is certainly one matter worthy of urgent consideration to support small business in its important role within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has told an independent international inquiry there is little opportunity of jobs for young people out of jobs even when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> improves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time this country was facing an economic crisis; people were told that we would have a long hard battle but that the Government intended to act responsibly and not try to play politics with the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Minister reconcile these figures with recent speeches he has made to the annual conference of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, and at the Clarence Pastoral and Agricultural Society’s 1977 beef cattle show, where he stated that his Government’s objectives were to help people in primary industry and in the productive industries back towards equality in opportunities within the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would encourage a continuation of that, at least to demonstrate the great use that it is for a country such as Australia to have here international organisations with large research activities which undoubtedly assist the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there has been improvement and there is now a steadiness in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever we talk of benefits, or pensions, or any social security matters administered by my Department it is important that we should look not only at the need to provide income security for people, but also at the cost that this imposes upon the rest of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a major trading nation and as a sparsely populated nation, the efficient functioning of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is vitally dependent upon adequate transportation and, of course, we are totally dependent upon oil for road transport because this is the only form of portable energy presently available in sufficient quantities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of vital importance to its <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to maintaining the standard of life that we are used to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covers all aspects of the population and immigration issue, from background chapters covering such areas as goals and options, population growth rate trends and recent policy history, right through to a discussion of the effect of immigration on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the possible policy options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to concentrate my discussion on the effect of immigration on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This chapter convincingly supports the very real necessity for a consistent and sustained immigration intake if we are to ensure a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a high standard of living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect of the paper relates to the question of migrants and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discussion on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the paper is a good one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many observers feel this is what is required currently as such a figure would allow more entries on humanitarian grounds and further would add stimulus to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thus create more job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959  Senator Wright  saw that it was necessary in the interests of the good government of this country if it was to develop as a viable political democracy, if its <span class="highlight">economy</span> was to develop, to have changes to the industrial powers of the Commonwealth; he saw that there would have to be changes to the broadcasting powers, to the corporations powers, to the marketing powers of the Commonwealth Government; he saw that the Commonwealth Government should have power over interest rates; he saw that there should be alterations to the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This review takes on an added importance because Australia, as an advanced industrial nation and <span class="highlight">economy</span>, has aspirations and demands that mean that a substantial share of the nation’s resources must be devoted to the cause of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it can be argued that the existing pattern of education and training in Australia has led to some bottlenecks in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If started the project would be a great aid to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia and certainly to the departments themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course a basic truth that the home construction industry, as with the general public and private construction industry, was destroyed by the bad economic policies of the former Whitlam regime and that the housing industry will recover at the same rate as the general <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the general thesis is that the thrust in housing will move with the general rise in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the position very dear to the heart of our unique national heritage held by the Australian War Memorial, will the Minister give the Senate an unequivocal assurance that, despite so-called <span class="highlight">economy</span> cuts, there will be a searching inquiry into all aspects of conservation and preservation at the War Memorial with a view to staffing adequately the section involved in the preservation and conservation of art works in the War Memorial? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Industry and Commerce seen reports by the New  Zealand Manufacturers  Federation that New Zealand faces a severe recession unless there is a significant change in the country’s balance of payments and that therefore access to the Australian market is imperative to the survival of the New Zealand <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the things that the Labor Government was accused of doing to damage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation have become worse under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We all know that although the Government claims that private enterprise can put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the rails it is the private enterprise section of the community that the Government is hurting in the initial stages of implementation of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has shown improvement An the 1974-75 recession, the general outlook remains  dinctly  brittle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have been a much more painful and protracted process to wait for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to find a new level equilibrium based upon a changed public-private sector balance with inflation running high and strong as it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They’re killing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> really - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we have a total figure of $ 1,000m which the Government has seen fit to forgo in the hope that it will have some stimulatory effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that many companies will benefit because of the better liquidity performance they will have, but will this be of any real benefit in stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during the next 12 months or so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We may ask ourselves what will be the position in, say, 2 or 3 years time when there may be high turnover in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, quite reasonable liquidity, and good cash flows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the Government would not wish to see this allowance operating in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that was, as we say, overheated thus causing a further stimulus to the private sector at a time when the Government might wish to dampen it down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an Opposition, we do not question or oppose the legislation if it is of real benefit, but we would oppose it and oppose it in future if it became an instrument that compounded the problems associated with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that was running too fast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to pursue it in great depth but I was interested to hear the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers),  in his reply concerning the application of this legislation in times of a more active <span class="highlight">economy</span>, indicate that on the assumption that inflation would fall presumably the commitment to the revenue would be lessened appropriately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do say is that in our present <span class="highlight">economy</span> what usually happens is that the bulk transport is handed over to be dealt with by the railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the plain fact of the matter is that while we live in a dictated private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> many of our railway debts will remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That grain is of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the farmers and of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Virgo said that he would consider whether the proposed <span class="highlight">economy</span> was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position carried on for longer than I think was expected then because at that time we were going through a period of steady increases in income and steady predictable growths in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Bureau is to be disregarded in this way I suggest it may as well be the subject of the Government’s next <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many major projects of vital importance to the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and development would have to be deferred or slowed down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps even more important than that is the economic situation in Australia generally which requires that Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland basically shall fuel the growth in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the next 10 or perhaps 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its submission to the recent national wage case the Government argued that devaluation effects on the consumer price index should be treated, for wage indexation purposes, in the same way as indirect tax increases in order to preserve the gains to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> flowing from the changed exchange rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should in these circumstances minimise as far as possible any action which would reduce the benefits conferred by devaluation on the competitiveness of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, nevertheless, the responsibility and aim of the Government to reduce inflation and restore confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite could argue that under the Labor Government we were going too fast, that we were doing things too soon and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could not stand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is happening now is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has gone completely into reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a much more dangerous exercise to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into reverse because it can place the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into such difficulties that it could go backwards quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Senator Lajovic  is saying is that we should bring these people into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in great numbers in competition with the unemployed who exist at the present time to discipline the workers of this country to work harder for less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government, when it was threatened with a massive dislocation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country by the trade union movement on 4 May this year, it retreated from the big stick position with the air traffic controllers and reverted to the second position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that in this place there have been statements indicating that on all the issues- trade union matters, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- the ACTU has proposed that there should be regular talks between the ACTU and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was done in similar vein to the way in which the Government rejected calls by the unions, by the employers, and by the State governments for a national conference to discuss the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would say that it would be grossly unfair to make workers take the responsibility for, shall we say, a better disciplined <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government says this may be to the disadvantage of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but the employer is the best judge of the needs of his workers and he is the best judge of their performance, and possibly he will agree to making an over-award payment when such a request was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continuing interest of the Commonwealth in the quality and <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the provision of legal aid in the Federal area will be given effect to in the following ways: Firstly, there will be a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and each State under which the Commonwealth will provide funds for the provision by the State legal aid commission of legal aid in the Federal area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather the Minister is able, under the Bill as I understand it, to make directions on the general guidelines for the Commission to take account of in respect of such matters as the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and rationalisation of business generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a number of situations in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today where a manufacturer and a customer are ready, willing and able to enter freely into an agreement which will create employment opportunities, attract risk capital, increase production and will go a long way towards solving our problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we talk about private enterprise and the special safeguards that are in the minds of some honourable senators, I point out that the concept of business enterprise as it operates in the United States <span class="highlight">economy</span> has always been put forward in this place as one that we should emulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the Commonwealth’s decision on sand mining on Fraser Island, the Queensland Government submitted in December 1 976 a list of projects for which it sought Commonwealth assistance in order to minimise disruption to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Maryborough region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-89">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Commonwealth Government advised the States that there will be increased funds available for State road programs ‘once the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has stabilised’, as was claimed by the Queensland Minister for Main Roads,  Mr Hinze,  quoted in the  Courier-Mail  dated 19 May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what are the details: and (d ) what is the Minister’s definition of a ‘stabilised <span class="highlight">economy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-93">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be looking to the Committee for advice on Australia’s energy reserves and on factors likely to influence the pattern of energy supply and demand, and future costs, in Australia; the assessment of and development of our energy resources, and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of use of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-99">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is still in bad shape, inflation is no better, economic activity is at a standstill and unemployment is worse than it was 12 months ago? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the viability of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> on King Island reached the Federal and Tasmanian governments some weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new tax system which is announced in this Budget has been made possible because of the efficiency and <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we have brought to management of Government expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition suggests that, rather than attack the unemployed, and rather than make life difficult for the unemployed as the Government has done, the Government should take positive steps, as every other government in the world is doing, to create jobs, to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> sufficiently, to take up sufficient of those unemployed and to create an economic recovery, which will mean that once again we can return to a sensible situation in this country without the difficulties we have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was because  Senator Withers,  his fellow shadow Ministers and the Prime Minister stated that they were the only people who could get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back into shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After 22 months in office this Government has had plenty of time to correct the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After two Budgets nothing is said about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> strengthening or about success in fighting unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government which understands and can manage the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is essential to Australia ‘s prosperity and to the revival of business confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is a need, as the Labor Party has said, to examine the promises of these people who put Labor out of office because it was said that we could not manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true to say today that not only can this Government not do it but in fact its Ministers come into the Parliament and refuse to answer questions about how it will get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would be productive work which would improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, after nearly 2 years and after promises to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going, professional people have no business confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the result of a recent survey in the United Kingdom when a team of German experts and businessmen were invited to the United Kingdom by the government and the people to see what was wrong with the British <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solution to the problem of employment in Australia surely lies- this Government is aware of it and I believe that more and more people in Australia are becoming aware of it- in the establishment of circumstances whereby this <span class="highlight">economy</span> develops to the degree that its commercial and industrial enterprises once again know stability, once again know incentive, once again know that there will be a reward for initiative and once again know that profit is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis is on stimulating the private sector, placing the whole onus for the recovery of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> on the private sector and neglecting the fact that we are a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the private sector has to be assisted and stimulated by expenditure in public areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tell you in all candour that that option not longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It offers initiatives to people who are prepared to work, but at the same time it attacks inflation, it cuts back the deficit, it reduces the Government’s own expenditure and certainly it will lead to a recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is the Government’s overriding aim of lowering the rate of inflation and raising the level of activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That policy will be administered to establish a stable climate for long life investment that will provide growth to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and an improvement in the living standard of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are certain structural problems within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot withstand another assault of the type that the Government is planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a serious position, and the Government has admitted it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It will put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a more serious position than it is already in by using tactics that some of the more radical, irrational Government supporters are proposing and supporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, as each day brings forth another document endeavouring to explain the Budget, does this not mean that the Government has no control over the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This leads me to query whether we believe immigration should be tailored to the needs of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or whether our economic programs should be tailored to the needs of people, including immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government appears to have closed its eyes to the serious position and presumably is hoping that recovery overseas will start a boost to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When demand is falling and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sick, this approach adds to costs, fuels inflation and further redistributes income from the lower income groups to the wealthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are to look seriously at an increase in real wages surely we should relate this to an increase in productivity in all sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as the news filtered through, as journalists, those in the media, most economists and others in various sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> began to look more closely at the Budget, they reached the position which the Opposition reached on the following days and which it has raised in Question Time, that is, that the Budget is one of complete and utter confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time the Budget proposals were intended to strengthen confidence among consumers and investors and thereby advance the recovery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a path of below economic activity, reduced Australian equity in Australia’s mineral wealth, reduced assistance in the rural sector and the further integration of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> into the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> to satisfy the profit dictates of the major transnational corporations and foreign capital investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have expected that the magnitude of Labor’s electoral debacle would have sheeted home to the Labor policy makers that their ideas were not acceptable to the Australian electorate and that the parlous condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is directly attributable to their efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy President,  there are very important aspects of the legislation because, as you will see, the organisation which is the subject of this legislation has functions which cover developments in the growth of international civil aviation, aircraft design, airfields, navigation, needs for air transport <span class="highlight">economy</span> and safety, and all of those matters that are the subject of that particular aspect of this legislation are encompassed within the brief remarks that I intend to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amendment wants to make it quite clear that the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> policy is not committed to full indexation As a socialist party in the long run we clearly, if we are endeavouring to emulate the lead given to us by the socialist countries of the Northern Hemisphere, can only achieve those objectives if we are prepared to pay the same level of tax as they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it would be best to remind those people who believe that the recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has not been as fast as they would like that it takes a silly donkey two minutes to kick down a barn door but it takes a skilled carpenter several hours to rebuild and replace that door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: Did  Mr Howard,  the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, write to the Industries Assistance Commission early in the life of this Government to ensure that the IAC gave due consideration to the employment effects of its recommendations, including their effects on employment in decentralised locations and the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to absorb any changes which the IAC might recommend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is finally becoming apparent, even to the Prime Minister himself, that the federalism policy is doing absolutely nothing to help the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could not provide it out of our own resources because of the general state of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are not contributing towards the resurgence, the stimulation and the regeneration of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in rural centres or, for that matter, in urban centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a worse state today than it was in when the Government came in allegedly to clear it up in three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do not talk to me about the Labor Government discontinuing a scheme when the pack- that includes all members of the Liberal and National Country parties and those who attempt to determine public opinion in this country- suggest that all the ills of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and all the ills of Western society could be solved if only government expenditure were reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For every person out of work this Government reduces the capacity of this country to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on a more even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the degree that there is a cut back in spending in the public sector, then in the long run this will maintain the downturn in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That sort of unproductive work is essentially of a band-aid nature and will make no long term contribution to the welfare of either the work force, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem arises not only in the inability of this Government to reactivate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also in the Government’s expectation that the States will be able to provide the finance that this Government is gradually reducing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was nearly $500m worth of projects it would automatically follow that there would be a substantial boost to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but that is being delayed by industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If these disputes were not taking place on these projects, there probably would be not only more jobs but also extra money in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-The Labor Party believes that the changes that are proposed for the Industries Assistance Commission, as set out in the ministerial statement brought down by the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack),  are a disguise or a cover for the Government’s incapacity to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They require the IAC to give consideration to matters affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those measures include increased structural adjustment assistance, retraining schemes and government stimulation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, the statement provides for openended supplementary guidelines at ministerial discretion in addition to the requirement that the IAC cannot make recommendations on changes in the structure of industry which cannot be immediately absorbed in terms of the current capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I repeat that it is not the IAC that is to blame for the slack state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>; it is the Goverment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expectation of business at the beginning of the term of this Government was that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would pick up because of expected recoveries in overseas economies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time there was the proposition that unemployment was a key factor in the revival of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government conceded, as we had to concede, that Australia was caught up in the dramatic events of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the downturn in the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now we see the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a state of complete stagnation with all the significant indicators showing that the months and perhaps the years ahead are to be very gloomy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that members on the Government side do not think very much about the ANZ’s analysis of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but generally I think it is accepted fairly widely through the business community as being a soundly based document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the essential reasons the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not going to get started again is because this Government has locked itself into the new federalism policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has mismanaged the nation’s affairs and has run the <span class="highlight">economy</span> like a child playing with a yo-yo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Prime Minister is panicking over the parlous state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> brought about by his Government was made quite clear in his speech last Sunday night to his own electorate of Wannon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Leader of the Opposition has moved as a matter of urgency the question of the Fraser Government’s incompetence in managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and it gives me great pleasure to support him in his remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This urgency debate, relates to a matter that I believe needs examination- an allegation that the Fraser Government has shown incompetence in managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that sort of contribution from the Opposition, and indeed from some sections of the media and the more radical leadership in the trade union movement, which has led to the distortion and confusion which are the greatest braking force on the recovery of this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and on the recovery of this country from the point of view of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in a sense the Opposition has done this Government a good service in bringing on this urgency motion for debate because it gives us the opportunity of asking people to think in a balanced way about what has been done about the policies and procedures that are being followed and which are undoubtedly bringing this <span class="highlight">economy</span> and this society out of the trough into which they had fallen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for instance, to one of the conclusions of the conference of the Labor Party in Perth just very recently when it decided that the economic recipe with which it would confront the Australian people from this time on to overcome the problems that are to be found in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> was the identical economic recipe that produced the very problems to which that Party refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, Labor supporters seek to cover up those sorts of matters and those sorts of embarrassing attitudes by this extraordinary statement that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not being well managed when the facts prove the opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people who are delaying the full measures of recovery in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to solve the unemployment problem in this country, it is to be solved by the desire- the genuine desire of the components of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including commerce and industry- to employ people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> is dependent so much on exports so the cost circumstance in that case is of greater significance than ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what major economic indicator we look at, we find that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is drifting further and further into depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicate that the thrust of the Government’s policy is to seek to reduce interest rates and to reduce taxation so as to reestablish incentive as the major factor in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which will lead to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, correctly from the point of view of the Australian Labor Party, is condemning the Government for its incompetence in managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact if we examine the comments that are being made throughout this country about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we find that the only people who are satisfied with our supposed progress are supporters of the Government in the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What have been the comments about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by reputable people- people who do normally take a critical view of the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the actual figures of those who were employed in the private and public sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it may be said that Budgets from State to State have adopted certain strategies in respect of government spending, as economic spokesman have suggested and as the Labor Party has suggested there has to be some selective spending in the public sector in order to get a regenerative process within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be surprising to some people who are listening to know that this afternoon we are debating a matter of urgency raised by the Opposition concerning the Fraser Government’s incompetence in managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some progress is now being seen in the recovery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and no further reductions are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the absence of trust that nearly brought down this country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>; it was the absence of trust on the part of businessmen who found that their profits were slashed and that there was no possibility of earning a decent profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we will not do, as we have been sensibly advised in the National Bank Monthly Summary of August 1977, is to go in for short term pump priming of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main we believe the strategy and priorities of the Budget to be correct and responsible insofar as the difficulties that currently beset Australia cannot be overcome by a government engaging in  short  term pump-priming of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of  Senator Gietzelt,  who spoke of the troubles of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, I point out that gross domestic product in 1976-77 grew by 3.4 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent in 1975-76 and 0.6 per cent in 1974-75- the last financial year of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that it is this Government which protects it and which will ensure, by the development of its strategies, that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will come out of its slump. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard enough grumbling about the situation from Opposition senators, who appear to emerge from their own ambitions which go well beyond any desire for an improvement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear much said about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the rural community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be one way in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would suffer very greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On many occasions we have seen the Treasurer selectively quote figures to prove that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is recovering, although most statistics demonstrate that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is going further and further into recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the demonstration in the Budget Papers that 1977 has seen a downturn in just about every indicator, it will come as no surprise to learn that the Premiers were not prepared to accept the assertions made on 1 July that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is recovering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is some upward turn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which the Treasurer has not indicated today, the direct and inevitable consequence is that there will be further unemployment in the building and construction industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is merely trying to reduce the public sector for ideological reasons and that is one of the basic reasons why the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a nosedive and cannot get out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the basic reasons for this Government’s incompetence at managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people are indeed sick of the strategy of this Government in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if all the States co-operated with the Commonwealth Government and emulated the example that it has set by exercising restraint in the areas that I have mentioned, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia would be improved in a dramatic sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased with the way in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is shaping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that there has been an improvement in significant areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation does not advance an argument about economic strategy or the shape of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or any schemes to reflate it that somebody might have dreamt up in some flight of fancy in the small hours of the morning perhaps after having another bad night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can have arguments about the shape of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be a regular sort of meal we will get from now on because we will have demonstrated to us day by day how a party which failed to handle the <span class="highlight">economy</span> thinks it can now do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not recover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, basically the same as the Labor statement of September 1975  the progressive introduction of a wages <span class="highlight">economy</span> appropriate to Cocos conditions; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts to which I refer are the figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that employment opportunities in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are continuing on a downward trend with private employment decreasing by 1 1,400 in the month of July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of all these matters, I ask the Minister to give us some small indication that he actually knows what is going on in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by providing us with revised estimates of personal income tax receipts now to be expected in the 1977-78 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One method of achieving a significant increase in fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the petrol engine is the development of the weak-mixture petrol engine such as the ‘stratified charge’ engine which could provide fuel savings in the range of 10 to 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fuel injection provides improved fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> because of more uniform fuel distribution and permits leaner air-fuel ratios and provision for complete fuel shut-off during coasting or deceleration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An average <span class="highlight">economy</span> of 10 per cent or more in fuel consumption is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Road construction and road maintenance are the best areas in which the Government could be acting to reduce unemployment and stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> if that is what it wants to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, there has been a deliberate decision on the part of the Government to increase unemployment, to superintend expanding unemployment, and to leave the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to find its own way out of the recession in which we now find it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has announced that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is picking up and that inflation is going down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will take a serious look at that and provide additional funds at a later date in this financial year to stimulate both the employment market and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The $27.73m allocated to meet the cost increases on approved projects means that more than half of the amount provided in the Budget will go towards compensating for the loss of value in the dollar as a result of the Fraser Government’s inability to cope with the declining <span class="highlight">economy</span> and with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from its general findings and many particular recommendations, the report has drawn together much useful information about the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including information on unemployment in the State, the outmigration of young people, the structure of industry and the State’s transport requirements and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report provides an overview of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has not previously been enunciated and which has important long-term policy implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we could perhaps also say that if there had not been a serious downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, in particular, a downturn in the manufacturing industry, that figure could have been greatly increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to stimulate them, not to say that it is their total responsibility to accept that this Government is not capable of running the affairs of the nation and that it has to come back on the private employer to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had first of all the consumer-led recovery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but then it was realised that the consumers were not being given a great deal of money and schemes such as that which increased children’s allowances were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has to consider seriously whether it will allow Australia to continue to follow the course it is on at the present time or whether it will take a firm hold on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and come to grips with the situation, create more employment by public spending, and so sort out some of the ills that we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They had no cash mentality let alone a cash <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Economic development is converting these people to a cash mentality and then to a cash <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intended to confine my address largely to manpower policy and its effect of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be argued that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the United States was such that even in the Johnson era, belatedly after riots, the colour situation eased somewhat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return now to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the manpower policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the way in which this document, this mechanism, should be looked at from the Australian point of view is as something that has within it the capacity to bring a real measure of survival, affluence and growth to this society and to this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to another matter that is relative to the recovery of this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to infer merely the pumping of masses of money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">economy</span> on earth that will grow to whatever potential it has unless there can be generated within it a real, proper and enthusiastic measure of expansion and confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is referable to continuing and increasing unemployment; it is referable to instability in an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only real solution to the unemployment situation in this country is to be found not in superficial short time exercises but in legislating to create an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in our society which is determined to get on with the job of production so that industry and commerce literally seek to employ people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that has been a significant contribution to the re-establishment of a measure of confidence in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has failed completely and there is nothing in the Budget to indicate any positive strategies for restructuring the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> or any positive strategies for creating viable national activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The logic of the Government escapes me when it claims that by reducing real wages, that by reducing the amount of money that the wage earner has to spend, somehow the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will improve, somehow consumption will increase and that demand will lead to increased productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government still seems to be of the opinion that by arbitrarily reducing the number of persons in Commonwealth employment it is doing something for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides no solutions as to the restructuring of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very foundations of any possible national unity or national purpose are being undermined by the economic policies of the Government, its failure to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the consequences of unemployment which result from sheer ad hockery in government and no plans for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A new situation developed in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> during the Labor Government’s years in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anything could more clearly indicate the Government’s lack of concern about the problem of unemployment in Australia than the opening half of  Senator Durack  ‘s address to the Senate in which he did not attend in any manner whatsoever to the real problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but led us through one of those tired old tirades about the communists in the trade unions in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be remembered that this Government was elected in the most extraordinary circumstances in 1975 on an undertaking that it would bring down inflation, reduce unemployment, stimulate business and get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is certainly going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many sicknesses in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time that can be corrected only by a long term approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as attacking the problem on a short term basis is concerned, we said that we ought to lower interest rates, that we ought to forgo any further increase in personal taxes, particularly for those in the lower income bracket who, when they receive the benefit of reduced taxation, tend to convert at a much higher rate the increased incomes they have received into the purchase of goods, which stimulates the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, than an equivalent reduction in the rates of income tax imposed upon the people in the higher rate of income, and that we ought to defend the Australian currency against another devaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obviously serious to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the honourable senator to tell us later if she gets the opportunity to do so- if the Government Whip has been sufficiently negligent to have put her on the speakers’ list- why it is that the Government is talking about having an election this year, one year before its time, if it is not because of the Government’s fear about the dreadful condition in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it is another ploy to add confusion and distortion to the circumstances that surround the efforts of this Government to bring this <span class="highlight">economy</span> or this society out of the trough into which it had fallen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is pretty clear that the cause of the present unemployment was basically an irresponsible escalation of the wage rates in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a real expansionary stability and confidence in an <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we succeed in establishing that sort of <span class="highlight">economy</span> in Australia, we cannot succeed in dramatically changing the unemployment circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are responsible enough to recognise that the solution lies not in temporary bits and pieces but in bringing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back to a realisation that only in a successful, developing and productive private sector in particular lies ultimate employment for all the people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If government expenditure is cut the <span class="highlight">economy</span> slows down gradually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has failed to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle involved in this is all the more valid when unemployment, as it is now, is the result of the government’s mishandling of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned earlier that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has ground to a halt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the situation, like the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is out of control but something can still be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting to the Government that it might take the step of stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The side effect of this will be confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Reserve Bank reportthe official forecast- which was leaked a couple of weeks ago demonstrated, contrary to the claims that are being made by senior Ministers of this Government, that the economic indicators are that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will drift deeper into recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister talks of economic treason, of allegedly reprehensible attempts by people in the Australian Labor Party and outside the Australian Labor Party to destabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by speculating about the value of the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard pleas from  Senator Scott  last night and from a number of other members of the Liberal and National Country parties that we really ought to get together and say that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is recovering, that business is booming and that will become self-fulfilling belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironic, to say the least, that that notion should be postulated by the Prime Minister, the man who during the latter part of 1975 continually talked about the alleged disastrous condition of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its alleged inevitable deterioration as long as socialist centralists remained in government, the man who held the threat of the withholding of supply or the deferral of the Budget as a sort of sword of Damocles over the then government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironic, to say the least, that the man who engineered all that has the audacity to condemn others for allegedly destabilising the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when  Mr Fraser  was in opposition sabotaging the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or attempting to sabotage the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it was no empty threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they want to take certain action to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the rails they have the numbers now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is treating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country as a yo-yo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the National Country Party were to argue that a tariff should be imposed against goods from overseas, which in effect is a tax on those goods, which places an extra charge upon the rural community and the community should receive a subsidy I would go along with that proposal as well because we need to run the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a balanced way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that this Government in the near future moves to rid our society of these people who are saboteurs of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence that is available from overseas economies which are further along the road to recovery than Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is that the level of unemployment is not falling as economic activity picks up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The business community, through its persistent outflow of private capital, is publicly making known its gloomy expectations for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> under the policies of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the Government’s bungling of the exchange rate and its failure to reduce both inflation and inflationary expectations the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now locked into a high interest rate position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the only sector that is able to provide the needed stimulus to economic recovery is the government sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way is now open to economic recovery with greater incentive for entrepreneurs to risk capital, thus expanding the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and creating more employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will enable a consolidation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and it will also enable us to build upon the foundations which were so successfully laid in last year’s Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital in order to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again that people must have the incentive to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of these substantial cuts in income tax will certainly give a substantial fillip to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The broad details of Australia’s Cocos policy are as follows: a representative form of local government for the Cocos community to be established with the ultimate aim being the creation of a fully elected body; arrangements to be made allowing a transfer to the Cocos community of the village area ofHome Island; the replacement of token money by Australian currency; establishment of a new form of fund to assist the financing of community activities’, there should be freedom of movement and communication within the Territory; the improvement of education and health facilities and general upgrading of living standards; the framing and implementation of laws which could be clearly applied and enforced, taking into account local institutions and customs; the progressive introduction of a wages <span class="highlight">economy</span> appropriate to Cocos conditions; appropriate means by which Australian citizenship can be provided to residents of the Territory who wish to take up Australian citizenship; the provision of financial assistance to Cocos Malays who wish to move from Cocos to Australia; and the ownership by the Australian Government of all land on which its facilities are located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every election in this country in recent times basically has been about the government of the country, about the running of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and about those who are most able to develop the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had elections that perhaps were thought would be elections on other issues, but basically the Australian people are concerned with what group of men and women is best capable of continuing to operate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  should end the election speculation now and get on with the job of improving the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader-designate of the Federal Opposition,  Mr Hayden,  should stop bad-mouthing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those on this side of the Parliament who were elected to improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to do a job ought to get on with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the community expects to have lengthy Parliaments and expects governments at times to have to carry out unpleasant tasks in putting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into proper shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main we believe the strategy and priorities of the Budget to be correct and responsible insofar as the difficulties that currently beset Australia cannot be overcome by a government engaged in short term pump-priming of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government is continuing to carry out a good program, but I hope once again that the turn-around in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will make it possible to return to a 2 per cent real increase each year which we have had previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said two years ago when he took over the job of endeavouring to improve Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> that it may take three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canberra: The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  gave a plain warning to business yesterday that the Government had done all it could to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that it was time for the private sector to get moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has demonstrated throughout this debate that if it were returned to government it would inflate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Jobs for the young will remain scarce years after the <span class="highlight">economy</span> recovers because of the number of married women in the work force, a top employers’ spokesman warned yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It offers initiative to people who are prepared to work, but at the same time it attacks inflation, it cuts back the deficit, it reduces the Government’s own expenditure and certainly it will lead to a recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women were actively encouraged to enter the work force in the 1950s and 1960s by the government of the day and by industry of the day because they were a source of cheap labour in a growing <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the recent phenomenon in this place of speakers like  Senator Scott  and others blaming our lack of national will and saying that we should somehow develop a national will to go out and do unspecified things, apart from working hard, that will get this country out of its problems- to have a sort of Uri Geller effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- and thereby turn this <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the right direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the amendment suggests and as many other speakers on this side of the chamber have pointed out, the Government, by its budgetary policies and its restrictive and contracting policies on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will intensify and prolong the present recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said last week, the Government’s policies are directed to the overall economic problem and to maintaining the trends which we have been able to get in the direction of recovery of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely honourable senators opposite will acknowledge the fact that we had a sick <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the early 1970s and that the Labor Government inherited a situation which was unsatisfactory in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government was elected to office in 1975- almost two years ago- it was given an overwhelming mandate to reduce inflation, to reduce unemployment and to bring about stability in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cannot be said that in any way any appreciable gains have been made with respect to any aspect of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have a very dismal situation and, in my view, a demoralised Government in terms of its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole strategy of the Government is wrong in respect of its approach to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is espousing policies that rely entirely upon the private sector to regenerate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why are we not having a general public debate about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They expect economic expansion in the US to be slower this year than last and predict that growth will probably halt and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> then turn down by late 1 978 or early 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has had everything going for it to remedy the situation as it saw it m 1975 when it said it wanted three years to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has had every opportunity to present policies and legislation and take the sort of options that are necessary to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on to an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when the wage rate of a 15-year-old escalates to the wage rate of a 19-year-old- $4.20 an hour- of course the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not stand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are kids who today have left school and who cannot get jobs, and as the weeks, the months and, it appears, the years go by and they still do not have jobs their chances of ever working again become slimmer because if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picks up and there are jobs available for youngsters the employers are not going to take on people aged 19, 20 or 22 years when they can take on youngsters aged 15, 16 or 17 years whom they do not have to pay so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But small businesses also play a number of particular roles in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in society generally which give them an importance beyond that indicated by statistics of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s failure to provide stimulatory measures to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is, I suggest, largely responsible for that problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should be taking steps to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> through more direct government spending in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Government does not understand a very fundamental fact; the price of energy controls the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the energy supply is cheap, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will go well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, of course, if he loses his nerve, it will be part of the campaign of Government supporters to say that he needs not three years to bring the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> under control but rather five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The adjustment to the system will, in any case, not be introduced until the beginning of 1 978 and if the Government is trying to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in a state of flux it is succeeding very well indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August this year when one would have thought that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was picking up, as we were told in the Budget, we found the position still worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are, therefore, carefully considering all proposals in the context of the current state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the further development ofthe Government ‘s economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It blames the former Labor Government for the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, yet it has had two years in which to repair it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when it took over, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in a lot better shape than it is now and unemployment was at a much lower level than it is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when we wanted to borrow money to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we were wrong because we did not try to get it through the sources through which the Government thought we ought to get it- that is, where the Government’s friends get the kickback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle involved in this is all the more valid when unemployment, as it is now, is a result of the government’s mishandling of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have made the point in this place before-certainly others have made it too- that government expenditure in the Northern Territory, more than anywhere else in Australia, affects the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the whole of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the 1976-77 Budget meant, as this year’s Budget will mean, a winding down of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some measures had been taken by the Government the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the Northern Territory could have remained buoyant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even at this stage the Government could take steps to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were to move in and to start building the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be stimulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that is needed is a little government expenditure to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Northern Territory moving and to ease unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that quite a few people would be surprised at the versatility, the flexibility and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of fourcylinder engines that are now available in motor vehicles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we have the crazy situation, on the one hand, where we are introducing legislation to conserve fuel and then, on the other hand, we are doing everything in the world to prevent more fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> and more efficient vehicles coming in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy that the Government has pursued m relation to employment generally is to achieve reactivation of the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the sector that employs three-quarters of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a complete loss to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, one which will never be made up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity granted by the debate on the first reading of this Bill to say several things about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and particularly to relate my remarks to South Australia and a district in which I am interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia is particularly influenced by current events in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in this political community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In simple terms, that is what h e did to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way that this <span class="highlight">economy</span> can succeed in the future until the rate of inflation is significantly reduced to a stage where it can be seen that profits are not to be made out of an inflationary expectation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on certain financial aspects of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by virtue of the first reading debate on the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977 which is before the Senate this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand that particularly to those of us who have felt over a long period of years that Budget strategy is supposed to have some beneficial effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the statement by the Leader of the Opposition might be one for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take some figures from the White Paper on the national income to indicate the total effect of the national income on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: I challenge any honourable senator opposite who is going to speak after me in this debate or in some subsequent financial debate to show to me how that 2 per cent reduction in wages and 2 per cent increase in surpluses is worthwhile to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators, as sensible and intelligent people: How on earth can we expect an <span class="highlight">economy</span> to boom or to respond in that sort of situation, when people are prepared to work and cannot find jobs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows that it cannot handle the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is getting completely out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel very strongly that what is required to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country going and to get an upturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is for the Government to bring about co-operation and consensus- not confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industrial unrest posed a threat to Australia’s whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>, ‘militant action . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Hill Samuel Australia Report for this month on prospects for 1978 indicates that the weak link in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the moment is consumer spending and that Australia’s economic recovery will not pick up until a level of consumer spending improves substantially? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, of course, the honourable senator is saying that there ought to be wage indexation irrespective of the effects of inflation, then he ought to say that also because no matter what the honourable senator’s reason for raising the matter at this stage, the facts of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are that yesterday the consumer price index showed an increase of 2 per cent and that ought to be hailed by everybody as the greatest news this country has had in the last 20 months because the previous Government had inflation roaring along at about 17 per cent and unemployment at, I think, 320,000 when it went out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the people who put up interest rates; they are the people who fed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that inflation roared along; they are the people who decided on a 25 per cent tariff cut across the board and displaced thousands upon thousands of Australians who were in gainful employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is still part of the Labor Party’s policy that the best way it can ruin Tasmania is to have industrial disruption to destroy the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fact gives me the most astonishing feeling of enthusiasm for the competent management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those examples illustrate the immense impact that the unions are making on an important area our <span class="highlight">economy</span> designed to determine our trade policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industrial disputation is based on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time and on the failure of the Government to produce a situation in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is working satisfactorily, in which employment is high and in which men can apply themselves to productive work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the fault of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the wages policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is not able to improve the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It knows that next year the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not be much better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the basic problem in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the industrial front today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, it is the development of guerrilla style tactics at the shop floor level within organisations which are disrupting extensive areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and of the community generally, bringing hardship to all sorts of people who are not involved at all in the dispute in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that next year unemployment will be worse, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be on the slide and so on, when the facts and figures prove that that is not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of promotion and prediction is the best contribution that  Senator Wriedt  and the Opposition could make in regard to the slowing-down recovery in this <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be related to the capacity of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, it is merely a measure by which is built into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the ill that may happen to be there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Bishop went on to say that the problems are not the fault of the trade union movement but are the result of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I must remind him and the Opposition that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is showing a significant move upwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be found in the big corporations, areas of the judiciary and other places where the real decisions about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That coming from  Mr Polite”  ought to be a warning to this Government that it will shortly have not only the united voice of the trade union movement and the Labor Party but also the united voice of employer organisations telling the Government that this is not the way to get industrial peace, that this is not the way to get the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The time had to come when there had to be a reappraisal of the traditional attitude about whether we should protect industries in Australia and thereby increase our cost of living or whether we should modify our <span class="highlight">economy</span> by allowing some imports into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The equivalent of $1 lm have been transferred in cash from Switzerland since 1 January 1974 to bring the paid in capital to the current level of $2 1 m.

    <p>We are not going to get it from a hotchpotch Prime Minister who reacts to situations from day to day as they occur, who refuses to set about the task of reorganising the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and making the decisions that are necessary to get regenerative processes under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is concerned about the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> having a chance to pick up, we would seriously suggest to it that the Prime Minister should put an end to speculation and take the necessary steps to carry out the mandate that the Government was overwhelmingly given in 1 975 to get our <span class="highlight">economy</span> back onto an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been saying in this chamber for quite a long time in response to daily queries about inflation and the health of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that the inflation rate is clearly coming down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That has been a critical factor in managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some supporters of the present Government parties who have resigned or who still remain in the Government’s rank are concerned at the possibility that the Prime Minister might renege on his earlier statement that the Government needed three years to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on a fair and stable keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government is currently in the process of pouring forth a series of palliatives to the Australian people and to badly hit sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now turn to the question of economic uncertainty and to the record of the Government in respect of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Government came into office with a wrecked <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has a great deal to do with uncertainty in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that is what this debate is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have quoted those articles because they are a vivid and timely illustration of the disastrous effects on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> of unauthorised irresponsible stoppages generated by a small section of irresponsible trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They work to the great detriment of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is in the light of that comment that the subject of this debate- the speculation about an early election and the effects of that speculation on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>- is raised by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is on record as saying that continued speculation about an election is damaging to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 28 September this year when speaking in Brisbane, the Prime Minister said that continuous speculation about an election is damaging to business confidence and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The heading to the editorial was: ‘<span class="highlight">Economy</span> the first election casualty’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But according to the article, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is likely to be the first casualty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It too is plagued by this handful of barbarians who are dedicated to the destruction of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have come to accept their growing unhappiness with the improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, because so much of their hope for a return to government must of necessity be built around disaster, and as that danger moves further away, so too do their chances of governing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the record of this Government in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, from a buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span> in  1 972  the community was yielding to the Federal Government’s immense and rapidly increasing sums in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dividends paid to those industries and to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by a high level of research are very significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since August last when the Prime Minister told the editor of the  Australian  newspaper that he might spring an election, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and political system have been subjected to very great stresses, strains and uncertainties deliberately created by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government believes the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is recovering, if it believes it is defeating inflation, if it thinks it is overcoming the unemployment problem, the Prime Minister and the Government would have chosen to remain here for the rest of the Government’s term which, as 1 said, if necessary could run for another 16 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The added return from agriculture and from the products which are produced will bring back to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in the form of overseas exchange and in the form of revenue through taxation on greater production, moneys which probably far exceed the cost of the subsidy itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the relatively short time that the Liberal and National Country Parties have been in government on this occasion we have aided significantly that important area of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty, by increasing the first advance payment on the Australian wheat crop by some 20 per cent, by increasing and maintaining over a prolonged period the base price of wool, by introducing income equalisation deposits and by a considerable number of other significant measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the greatest diseconomy that could occur, for two reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we are applying our restricted expenditure <span class="highlight">economy</span> proposals to capital construction of a productive nature is, I think, shortsighted in the extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of that we are restricting our capital works and allowing private enterprise to inflate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as it has in Sydney, where there are acres of vacant office space of two or three years standing that should have been built by the Commonwealth two or three years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this place have been saying for a long time that some things are necessary for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, one being a downward movement in interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that it is important to encourage the search for minerals which today form such an important part of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industries within which the bulk handling operations take place are of enormous significance to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was done in the interests of effective management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, who is their leader over any period of time; secondly, and more importantly, who speaks for them in the financial sense and what policy do they present as a party in relation to the guidance of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the effect it has on all Australians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further references were made in subsequent media, one in an article headed ‘Hayden wants $3.5 billion deficit’, and another in an article in which the Treasurer,  Mr Lynch,  clearly answered this disarray by saying:  the Australian Labor Party economic proposals, released yesterday in Sydney, would trigger off a new wave of inflation and push the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back into the depression created by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser,  having pulled this premature election because he knows very well that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sliding rapidly further Unto recession, pretends that the Government is optimistic, that the economic depression has bottomed and that we are rapidly moving into an era of new prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private final consumption expenditure is one of the areas that both the Prime Minister and his Treasurer claim is a major indicator of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of all this objective evidence and all the statistical proof the Prime Minister has the audacity to claim that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is recovering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister really believed that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was recovering we would be having an election next year and not this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the alleged mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the then Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has become much worse: 62,000 more people are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the major economic indicators show that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is sliding deeper into a recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could not quite follow his economic theory, but it seems to me that he demonstrates some interest in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> on occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberals are using the uranium issue to take the minds of the electors off the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not an issue that will take the place of the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the unemployment situation in the forthcoming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are all aware that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is stagnant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that, with all due allowance for the growth of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, these gas and coal sources will together provide Australia’s energy requirements for well beyond a 50-year period and that future technological developments will enable us to keep pollution from these sources down to an acceptable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When I read that it had expressed confidence in Australia’s future, its opportunities and its <span class="highlight">economy</span> I was greatly heartened, because it did not express that confidence at the time when the Australian Labor Party was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it not a fact that on many occasions in this chamber he has denigrated quotations of authoritative sources in Australia about the position of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the prospect for the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that this peace should be maintained for the sake of the industry, the employers, the employees, the trade and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mean a challenge which requires performance in this industry on an effective basis, with a decent relationship with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of other industries and the trades which we have to carry on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without a single shadow of doubt we have embarked upon one of the greatest conspiracies that has ever affected the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>- a marrying and a merging of an interest of people who have no real interest in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and no real interest in the Australian people, except to plunder that which is available to them under the seven Bills before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the company referred to by the honourable senator is prepared to invest $30m is a sign of confidence by that company not only in Tasmania but also in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The company must believe, as we have been propounding, that inflation is coming down, interest rates are coming down, and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is really on the improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The suggestion was that they had to get them done and into this Parliament early because the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  had a whim at that time that he would not go his full three-year term, despite the fact that he had been saying since he came to office that he needed three years in office to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> onto its feet, but that he would go to the people a third of the time in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did indeed resent a Victorian senator preaching to me as a Queensland senator about Queensland’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and about what we should and should not be doing when our State’s contribution to the nation ‘s economic health is so overwhelmingly far ahead of the contribution of bis State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How disillusioning it was for the people of Australia to find that not only did the Labor Party not provide the type of government for which they had hoped, it even made a most disastrous hash of managing the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we have seen the pendulum swing to the stage where at the last election in December the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was probably the only issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that underlying that there is still a desire by people to build up a nation which has something more to it than mere material wellbeing In our struggle to overcome the ills of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that should not be forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle involved in this is all the more valid when unemployment as it is now, is a result of the Government’s mishandling ofthe Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a considerable time now, the Government ought to have been aware of the effect of the mining boom on the other sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, yet there has been no planning, forethought or manpower policy, no attempt to balance our resources, no attempt to ensure that if one sector, such as manufacturing, lost its viability, there would be other areas of productive activity into which workers and investors could transfer their resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this Government is to be soundly condemned for its failure to confront realistically the basis of unemployment in this country, its failure to realise the need for a restructuring of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and its failure to implement a manpower policy on which training schemes can be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need to establish a commission to review the functions and nature of the Constitution, which was framed before many of the developments of the 20th century- such as industrialisation, the need for increased Government participation in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, guaranteed employment, the rights of trade unionists, basic human rights, civil liberties and the role of political parties within the governmental systembecame as important as they are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General made reference to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, saying that inflation had been sharply reduced and interest rates had begun to fall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After talking about growth factors in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one would expect it to fall from February or March because of the seasonal factors in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, Brenner’s book  Mental Illness and the <span class="highlight">Economy</span>,  a report of a series of studies which used unemployment as a major economic indicator, contained a good deal of evidence which indicated that the link between mental illness and unemployment exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it may be stated that the study revealed an inverse relationship between the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and mental illness- that is, the worse the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> the higher the incidence of mental illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> was shown by his study to be the single most important source of fluctuation in mental hospital admission rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was I correct in understanding that the answer to my first question indicated that the Government agreed that tax cuts are part of its policy to give more take-home pay and thus increase consumer demand and stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As to the first part of the honourable senator’s question, the Government, unlike the Labor Party, believes the tax cuts are a vital part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and are, indeed, a stimulus, a just stimulus, to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken in isolation, and dealing purely with nominal wages at a given point in time, the effect of discounting wages is, of course, not such as to pass on the total indexation; but that is done because it is clear to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it was to Labor’s leader when he was Treasurer and brought down his Budget, that inflation caused by the upward spiralling of wages is a disaster to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘The <span class="highlight">Economy</span>’ it was stated that the Government’s economic policies will continue to be based on, amongst other things: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in its present state the Queensland Government has placed limitations, as has the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the loss of productive forces to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there is this terrible social problem of drugs amongst the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to point out to the Senate one of the reasons why this is so, apart from the depressed conditions in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years in which we were in government we had to contend with a massive jump in import prices and this produced an enormous inflationary input into our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that the production sector of this <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a very sad state indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He called upon the Federal Government to plan if need be for an additional $1 billion deficit in order to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it would appear that the policy is to depress the <span class="highlight">economy</span> during the 1978-79 period in the hope that we will see a return to some levels of prosperity by 1980, which is when the next election is due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was introduced on the basis that it would help to bring about a recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unless the States can advance their works programs and provide employment opportunities and contracts for the private sector, then it will not be possible for us to expect any lift in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, at least in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>leaves serious uncertainty about the progress of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ignores the serious recession in the international <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment which was so ably moved by  Senator Wriedt  and which comments critically on the failure of the Government to deal adequately with the record levels of unemployment, the failure of the Government to deal with the serious uncertainty which exists in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the ignoring of the serious international recession which faces the world as well as on a number of other matters which were dealt with by  Senator Wriedt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, those Speeches have not contributed to the important public debate which ought to be taking place in this country about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government relies entirely upon the general public as part of its general strategy to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> movingthat is, it expects consumer demands to increase, one is entitled to say that the Australian people are not responding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prospects for the future are not such as to inspire confidence, and especially is that true given the Government’s failure, as evidenced by the Governor-General’s Speech, to recognise the true nature of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the fact that our current problems arise from that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than that, at the same time the Prime Minister has been interfering in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in such a way as to ensure that there will be still less rather than more price and employment flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many of the economists are saying that governments must rein in public spending, yet I have heard rumours suggesting that, because of the lack of progress in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, this year the deficit will exceed the deficit of the last Labor Budget- something in excess of $6,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have  Senator Carrick  today, and other Government speakers, including  Mr Lynch  in the other place a couple of days ago, the Prime Minister and the Governor-General, in his Speech, ignoring the rationale, the figures, and all of the experience of other developed countries and also ignoring the basic facts about our own <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that there are great challenges facing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and, I submit, also the Australian Parliament and Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What may be necessary is a more fundamental reappraisal of the role of the publicsector in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such improvements can be achieved only by government intervention in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over and above this, it might be necessary, in order to make enterprise more responsive to the needs of the community, for the public sector to move into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in areas traditionally regarded as private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Keynesian theory was that mass unemployment could be avoided provided governments exercised moderate and indirect control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He saw governments exercising economic power over the macro-economic factors in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and mild government intervention as keeping capitalist organisation healthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government states repeatedly that it is relying on the private sector to make the investment decisions that will regenerate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many reasons for that increase and for its continuation beyond 1973, but, whatever the reasons, it is absolutely deadly for our <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention that we have introduced the most dramatic changes in income tax that have ever been introduced into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 could go on listing our accomplishments, which are accomplishments of some real measure and of real importance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the most significant areas in which cost delays the development of that massive area which ultimately must become the crux of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that a contributor to unemployment has been the constant effort of trade unions, particularly the radical elements of trade unions, to seek higher and higher wages and better and better conditions regardless of productivity and the capacity of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has disadvantaged the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there has been a complete stagnation of the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">economy</span> does come back to normal we are going to need tradesmen, we are going to need a full balance of tradesmen, and we are going to need apprentices in their first, second, third and perhaps fourth years of training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also expresses the Government’s objective that any measures to achieve changes in the structure of industry are taken only after due regard has been given to the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sustain those changes and to absorb members of the work force displaced by those changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 8 of this amending Bill seeks to change the inquiry guidelines of the Commission to ensure that in addition to the former guidelines which were laid down by the 1973 legislation the Commission must take into account the Government’s desire to achieve balanced growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and improved efficiency in the use of productive resources while ensuring that its recommendations to change industry structure are adhered to only after regard for the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to adopt and to absorb displaced workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In paragraph 7 of its first annual report the IAC points out that the Commission is required to report annually to the Government on its operations and on industry assistance in Australia and its effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1974-75 annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission pointed out the number of measures introduced by the Labor Government to assist industries and the workers employed in those industries to enable them to adjust to certain structural changes in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our amendment seeks to criticise the Government for its failure to develop a long-term economic strategy which will concern itself with the social and economic aims of full employment, which will meet the needs of a developing <span class="highlight">economy</span> and which will enable our manufacturing industry to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proposed new paragraph (aa) of proposed new section 22 provides that the IAC will have regard to improving the efficiency with which the community’s productive resources are used, while ensuring that any measures to achieve changes in the structure of industry are taken only after having due regard to the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to sustain those changes and to absorb any members of the work force displaced by those changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I strongly support the idea of having a long term program to develop our water resources, but the Federal Government is charged also with the management of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and there must be flexibility in any budget so that programs can be changed to take account of things that arise in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reasons given for the lack of content in the Gallery’s report included the Prime Minister’s directive of 12 July 1976 seeking <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the preparation of annual reports, the Crown Solicitor’s advice that due to the short time period and the fact that no expenditure was incurred only a brief report would be necessary and the advice given by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to the Gallery Council that it could not report on the activities of the previous Interim Council because it had been abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr David  Biles to whom I referred a moment ago in relation to predictions about increases in crime rates and subsequent decreases has also stated that some of the factors which contribute to increasing crime rates are unemployment, inflation, the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Lilley also made the very important point that a prerequisite to the restructuring of Australian industry is the end of the recession which has plagued the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> for about the last three years and which is unquestionably deepening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Measures of this type are a very poor substitute for wider-ranging government policies which will lift the <span class="highlight">economy</span> out of the recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policies we have had over the last two years have now, on the absolutely decisive evidence of the latest quarterly national accounts, driven the <span class="highlight">economy</span> deeper into recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a way it was bound to fail unless the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picked up, because the policy is very closely tied to the Government’s economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not much sense in cutting back government spending, which is the one sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> capable of growing substantially in the current climate, to boost a private sector which cannot expand unless demand, either by consumers or by government itself, picks up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anything that is a negative contribution to an <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which people who are striving hard and successfully against problems of inflation and unemployment and in the fight to re-establish that which we need perhaps more than anything else- a sense of national pride and a knowledge that initiative will be rewarded and justice will be seen to be done is to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have already mentioned we must consider sooner or later- the sooner the better- the introduction of larger, wide-bodied aircraft, such as the Airbus, the Boeing 727 or the Lockheed Tristar, with better operating <span class="highlight">economy</span> per seatkilometre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part of that can be attributed to the recession in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the downturn in paper and cardboard production, but it also can be attributed to the surge in plantings over the last 20 years, leading to huge quantities of first and second thinnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present is in a most depressed condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way can anyone say that these statements are suggestive of any healthy signs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to pursue these points at any length, but I place on record in the debate on these Supply Bills the fact that although we are not opposing them we make it clear that we believe that the Government continues to move in the wrong direction and that if these policies are to be pursued we will not see any recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, certainly within the next 12 months, and any recovery is highly unlikely within the next two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real damage has been done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this financial year, and I think that the date we have suggested is good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Senate to even dream of giving the tax dodgers protection at this late date is not in the Government’s interest, not in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>’s interest and it is certainly not in the interests of ordinary justice and fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister outline the circumstances of  Mr Wran’s  conversion to a new and more rational view of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuing harmful effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of stated government intentions to further reduce government spending in the forthcoming Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition launches this matter of public importance because this may well be one of the last opportunities prior to the Budget being brought down in August that we will have to discuss the effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the reasons for the continuing decline of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country parties said they would attack the deficit by getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> working up to capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought, as I think most Australians would have thought, that with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> running at about 70 per cent capacity there was enormous scope to transfer resources to the private sector without touching the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we have substantial growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, unemployment will  continue  to rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so far the allowance has done nothing to counteract the negative forces in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were competition from resources in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, cutting back on government spending would at least be understandable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when there is an enormous surplus of resources, at a time when the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is running at about 30 per cent under its maximum, at a time when unemployment is approaching the half million mark, it seems extraordinary that the Government continues to pursue these policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can only have a further dampening effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government achieves this result, the one sector in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> now providing jobs will be prevented from carrying out that function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result must be that unemployment will continue to rise even more sharply with further damaging effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meanwhile, unless appropriate economic measures are adopted now, the hopeful signs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could prove illusory, and inflation could take off again from its already high level, to a thoroughly destructive effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the structure of our mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, where three out of four jobs are in the private sector, there are firm limits on how far the public sector should be stimulated in this recovery phase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As world trade prospects brighten, private capital inflow will reassert its traditional, dynamic role in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, removing the need for official borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of public importance has been put forward by the Labor Opposition in order to discuss the continuing harmful effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of stated Government intentions to reduce government spending further in the forthcoming budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the report in the  Sydney Morning Herald  of this morning,  Mr Wran  said that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was slowly recovering and that it was time to loosen some of the restrictions which had been imposed- they have been imposed by the Federal Government- so that more money would start to flow through the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the restrictions which had been introduced in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to achieve this were imposed for too long, it would be a savage price to pay in terms of unemployment in a country with Australia ‘s rich natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view is that what should be happening now is a judicious uplift to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by means of allowing more money to flow within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are saying is directly in line with what the New South Wales Premier stated and that is that if the Government continues its present economic policy of tightening up and screwing down the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that fewer jobs and less work is available to the Australian work force, then in the years to come the Australian nation will be in severe economic difficulties indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian public is completely at a loss to understand the statements and utterances of Ministers, particularly of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  on the state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not long ago, about January or February, he said that unemployment would wane, that employment opportunities would start to come good, that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would come around the corner and that it would be time for people to spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continuing harmful effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of stated Government intentions to further reduce Government spending in the forthcoming Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All members of the Australian Parliament agree that at present the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is recessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking that ingredient as the prime, a further tightening will be exactly the wrong treatment because it will mean that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be further recessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this discussion could contribute anything to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to the Australian community this afternoon, it would be only that people would analyse the circumstances that they find around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in line with their normal attitude because their proposition and the way they have put it seems to be directed to one course only, and that course is the confusion and distortion of the circumstances of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that members of the Opposition would be well advised from their own point of view, to say nothing of the point of view of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and social circumstance, to get away from predicting doom, to get away from this attitude of disaster, this emotionalism, and concentrate on a constructive circumstance which can and must bring this country up from the depths to which it was driven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reintroduction of the superphosphate subsidy, the introduction of family allowances, the encouragement given to oil and mineral research and development are all matters which are contributing to the revival of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, there is no doubt that it can be overcome only by the establishment in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a real measure of confidence and of an expansionary circumstance in which it pays to employ more and more people when there is profit in the enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are signs that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is getting out of the trough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Scott, when castigating the Australian Labor Party and particularly the present Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Hayden,  for drawing attention to the harsh facts about the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, appeared to believe that because the Labor Party draws attention to these facts it should be held responsible for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When confronted with politically embarrassing facts about the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, especially facts on unemployment, government spokesmen usually respond in one or more ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has apparently forgotten that this Government has a policy which is working; that inflation is indeed being conquered; that the defeat of inflation is a prerequisite to establishing a foundation for the solid growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its whole argument is based on the premise that inflation derives from some outside cause and is not generated within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties were created by virtue of the huge wage increases of that time, which were accentuated by the huge government expenditures and the costs caused by shortages in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of the Government’s diverting resources that would otherwise have found their way into the hands of the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an illustration of what has been happening in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of Labor’s term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the things that we are still fighting against in order to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on a sound footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think  Senator Wriedt  pointed out earlier, because of the cost problem in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, manufacturers are moving into the use of machinery in order to displace workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore of the greatest importance that the Government’s policies be aimed at increasing productivity to ensure that unit costs are reduced and consequently that we are able to re-employ workers in other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those reforms have had a huge impact on the position of consumers in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and obviously, in the year to come, they will have a very significant effect now that there has been a substantial fall in the level of inflation in the recent financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the great Latrobe Valley power strike as a result of which production in this country fell through the floor and consumer demand was obviously affected by the lack of confidence created by that huge dispute which had considerable effects throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation, which is well recognised by him, is that we need to get costs down before we can start reemploying people and that is the foundation on which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs to be built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the Opposition in its motion has suggested that the reduction of Government spending will have continuing harmful effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one way in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will regain full health and that is by reducing our cost levels below international cost levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be significant that Queensland, being one of the major contributors to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is thankful for the small mercies that it receives from Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if that sort of attitude which was put forward by  Senator Wright  were adopted- and even the introduction of retrospectivity is nearly as bad- it would create uncertainty leading to a loss of confidence and would lead to further regression in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the thousands of small businesses which have gone bankrupt in the last year or so, it must be obvious even to the Government that unless steps are taken which will inject the necessary finance into this area of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, then more shall businesses will continue to go to the wall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to overcome fundamental imbalances in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, such as inflation, in order to put small business on a sound footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the months immediately ahead, the main trading nations will be making decisions which will be of crucial importance to the future of the international <span class="highlight">economy</span> and world trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the negotiations achieve their objective of reducing barriers so that world trade can continue to expand, they will have made a major contribution to the further growth of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to the raising of living standards in both the developed and the developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no section of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that does not benefit directly or indirectly from a buoyant world trading <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators know, since this Government came to office it has had a deliberate policy of depressing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to lower inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the trap in these tax sharing arrangements is that the amount paid to the States depends on how the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">economy</span> goes bad, unemployment increases, personal tax collections fall below the level anticipated and the States receive progressively less money, depending on the level of tax collections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The substance of Australia’s statement on the state of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> was that the continuing high rate of inflation was the prime concern for all countries; that any attempt prematurely to reflate would result in rekindling inflation of the kind experienced in the 1970s, with the inevitable consequences of another recession; that no recovery would take place unless all major countries maintained a tight grip over their domestic inflation rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has clearly stated its policy that maximum restraint is to be applied within the Government sector in the interests of the over all recovery of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned with the proper management of not only biological stocks but also the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the only ground on which that Budget can be considered anti-inflationary is the degree to which it will drive the <span class="highlight">economy</span> deeper into depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the many years of campaigning and the number of very good arguments which have been put forward by the AWGC on the effects of protection on the agricultural sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, it seems to have entirely escaped  Sir Samuel  Burston ‘s notice that one of the measures which was associated with the Budget, of which he approves, is that tariffs will be increased effectively by nearly 30 per cent for our most highly protected industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So really nothing has been gained, except the introduction into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of what I consider to be a highly inflationary measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that restriction upon travel is a false <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is stagnant, unemployment is rising, there are bad prospects for our balance of payments, our industry is going off-shore in sheer desperation, we have a declining share of the mining market and our markets have warned us, notably Japan, that our share of those markets may well decline further in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is the present Government doing about this very serious problem in an industry that is so important for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a trend that has occurred over the past two years, and of course there have been actions and repercussions throughout the entire <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing industry has been the springboard governments use to inject quick, efficient and non-inflationary life into a depressed <span class="highlight">economy</span>- but today this arm of economic management is being allowed to wither. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night in the House of Representatives, the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Hayden,  put forward a realistic, practical plan to boost not only the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally, but also specifically the housing industry, the building industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed unfortunate that this should be the case, given the vital importance of the building industry to the rest of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is good for building is good for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is to blame for the inadequate recognition of the importance of the building industry and the need to develop some regenerative processes in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not adequate or sufficient in the circumstances of today’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that public opinion will bring pressure to bear upon this Government and cause a change in its economic strategy and a recognition that the building industry is in fact one of the most important sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason it was out last year is that it overestimated receipts because its policies are turning down the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which means that fewer and fewer people are paying tax and, secondly, its policies - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I plead with the Government to introduce selective stimulation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which is essential for it to move again not only from the humanitarian aspect but also from a sound economic point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when there is an enormous amount of unemployment, when the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs stimulation, when more than 100,000 Australians are looking for government housing and more than twice that number would like to build their own houses but do not have the wherewithal to do it, this Government is doing nothing to stimulate the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government admits that the housing industry is important to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, yet the industry is at its lowest ebb since 1967 and the Government is going to do nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless this Government does something about unemployment, it might as well stop talking about the <span class="highlight">economy</span> being lifted because there is no way in which it can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will lose employment; there will be no stimulus whatsoever to growth and the stimulus to that <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is so essential to Australia’s future will not eventuate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget painfully reminds us of commitments that were made, not only during the last election campaign, but also throughout the past two and a half years: Commitments of jobs for all; a commitment of a revitalised <span class="highlight">economy</span> which would give the business community hope to plan for the future; a commitment of no more expensive overseas trips; a commitment to give the States a better deal; a commitment to reduce income tax; and, most important of all, a commitment to work in the interests of the total Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, we have 150,000 more Australians unemployed since Malcolm Fraser came to office; the business community bewildered by a Government that refuses to accept any role to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again; overseas trips at $600 a night in plush New York hotels; State governments starved of funds for vitally needed capital works programs; a* massive increase in taxes- both direct and indirect; and, finally, an Australian community disillusioned and confused as to where this Government is taking the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not mean talking about integrity when one is not demonstrating integrity, nor does it mean forcing the community and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to fit into a pattern that reflects the narrow political philosophy of one man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Fraser Government came to power it promised that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would improve and it was argued that tax reductions were needed to initiate a consumer-led recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance was meant to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Externally, our export growth will be constrained by the continuing moderate growth of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> in 1978-79. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a stagnant <span class="highlight">economy</span>, massive unemployment and an increasingly divided Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have done so in the first day or two but, like other Australians, it is realising what further problems the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will be finding in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At best it may be 3 per cent and, if predictions about the state of the international <span class="highlight">economy</span> are correct, it is highly unlikely that it will reach 3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot allow this Government to continue with its present attitude that it does not have the responsibility of taking the initiative to reactivate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Opposition has put forward in its alternative Budget, it does not attack some sort of artificial set of circumstances which Opposition members say are afflicting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very impressed with the way in which the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  has drawn up the document in order to provide long-term, sustainable recovery in areas of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is amazing that the Opposition continually misses the point about what is wrong with the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain industries, well known to Opposition senators and honourable senators on this side, have been destroyed by the activities of the Opposition when it was in government in seeking to achieve higher levels of costs to the community by encouraging wage increases beyond those which the community could stand, by imposing higher taxation levels and by ensuring that the wrong sort of emphasis was given to the development of certain programs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the interrelationship between this basic problem of inflation, the rest of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the way in which it operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how can that happen when we have such a high level of interests rates within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look a little further at the potential of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to overcome the difficulties that have been imposed upon it by virtue of those years of misrule by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is basically dependent upon the ability of private entrepreneurs, private industry, being able to obtain funds cheaply in order to spend on new developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a vital element in preserving the free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> by virtue of businesses being able to preserve capital within the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a vital element in terms of the development of the free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> and especially in light of what occurred during the period of the Labor Government- high rates of inflation and rip-offs in taxation generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which we can achieve the ultimate recovery in this <span class="highlight">economy</span> is by achieving a lower cost structure- lower than that of other nations- not through the alternative strategy that the Labor Party offers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in Australia recognise the fact that there is still some pain to be borne in this community by virtue of tax increases to put the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on to a better basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to indicate two areas where I believe this scrutiny ought to be undertaken- the use of armed force and the organisation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be some hardened souls left who would be prepared to forgive this Government its cynicism, hypocrisy, dishonesty and inhumanity if they could be persuaded that all this harsh medicine was really necessary to turn the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not altogether surprising when it is contemplated that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole has almost ground to a halt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the most depressing single aspect of this whole Budget for anyone concerned, as all Australians must be, with the whole future structure, operation and prosperity of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, is what it reveals about the Government’s response to the striking and enormously far-reaching changes which have been occurring in very recent years in both the domestic and international market places, all of which have direct and immediate implications for the kind of economic strategy that the Government ought to be pursuing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, what matters is not government intervention in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for its own sake, but rather the nature and quality of that intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as long as the unions are kicked, gouged, bullied and blamed for all the ills of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, which overwhelmingly are not of their own making, and as long as they are completely ignored by organisations like <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I am confident that we can identify and solve the fundamental problems which afflict the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and do so far more effectively than the present Government, I certainly do not suggest that we have all the answers now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that guided and moved by these values we can not only identify, confront and solve the problems that afflict the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but also we can do it in a way which is not an affront to the decency, humanity or dignity of the ordinary Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in power, the Australian Labor Party Government had no doubts about the importance of external factors for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows the main policy thrust of the Government to generate the productive aspects of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initiatives were designed to meet the particular needs of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and we believe that that is what will follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the precarious state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the tremendous increase in overseas borrowings, it is far from satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that I hope that when there is some response later today to this Bill more perspective will be given to the consequences of the use of this Loan Bill for defence purposes and the matters that are so important to the management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the impact of the funds on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> utterly ignored? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> in terms of loss of work, wages and production probably ranges between $500m and $ 1,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister is well aware that Switzerland is one such country and a country whose <span class="highlight">economy</span> and inflation rate we could well attempt to copy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it certainly is a well known and well established fact that any waterside dispute has an enormous adverse impact on our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly on overseas trade which is so important to our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only sense in which this Budget is antiinflationary arises from the certainty that it will drive the <span class="highlight">economy</span> deeper into depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more that the price of fuel goes up the more they will have to pay attention to fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> as more fuel efficient cars come from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that high fuel prices are significant in their impact on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To hear Government supporters speak one would believe that the reason this is not the case in Australia is that the public sector does not like the political colour of a particular government or the particular state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at a particular point in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This hike in petrol and petroleum products costs will have a disastrous effect, as indeed will the whole Budget, upon the disposable incomes of the vast majority of the Australian people at a time when the Government says it is concerned about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the lack of confidence and the inability of consumers to buy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several Labor spokesmen have gone to some pains in this debate, as did the previous  speaker,  to claim that the Government can no longer blame the Whitlam Government or that era between 1972 and 1975 for the problems which beset the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one thing for Labor to refuse to admit publicly that its policies ravaged a stable <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that our policies have effected a first stage of a dramatic recovery; it is another thing for Labor supporters to advocate what they are currently advocating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>there is still some pain to be borne in this community by virtue of tax increases to put the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on a better basis’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a number of views on the expenditure of money by the Government, the effect of increased public investment and what it might do to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This view argues that not only will unused resources be made productive but also the increased incomes and consumer demands resulting from this investment will produce secondary developments within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as the new and increased incomes are spent, making new investments in the private sector profitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My belief is that there are areas in which we could usefully encourage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at the present time, in a way in which we could, I think, obtain greater employment without at the same time affecting the Budget strategy on inflation or causing increased inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The familiar attack on wages and wage earners is repeated again and again throughout the Howard Budget which failed entirely to face up to the real issues, such as the structural problems in the local <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the weakness in managerial and entrepreneurial skills in the private sector, the huge profits which are made by foreign-owned companies and are taken out of the country, the destabilising effect of the unplanned introduction of new technology in the work place, and the failure of consumer demand in this period of economic depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prospect of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> even more heavily dependent on international commodity markets supported largely by the fragility of service industries is not an encouraging one for our future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser  claimed in 1975 that he wanted three years to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back into gear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those three years are almost up and today the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is in a worse mess than ever with unemployment up and increasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that some of the fervent views he expresses on the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> are more akin to our philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Tate  was not a member then and perhaps did not fully understand the disastrous consequences to this nation of the three years in which Labor was in government, in the choking off and drying up of the whole of investment, particularly in the resources area, the area on which the strength of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is largely based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an encouragement to us to see how our nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is standing in relation to those of our major trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite clearly they are not able to be converted with any degree of <span class="highlight">economy</span> into residential premises, even if it could be said that it was desirable that they be used for residential purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the matter raised by  Senator Watson  about the action being taken by the trading banks is correct would this suggest that there is an additional cost factor involved in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manifestly false <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there a policy on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the efficiency or the humanity of giving the frail aged and the disabled the ability to remain at home with community services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This manifestly false <span class="highlight">economy</span> is estimated to save the Commonwealth $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in keeping the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in irons- I think that has to be said- acquires a certain responsibility to tidy up after it and to think outside purely economic considerations to the social strains it is putting on this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the first comment one should make is that it is a healthy sign of a resurgence of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that the stock exchange should be so buoyant and increasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In political <span class="highlight">economy</span>, having induced politicians to discard the old programme, the devil take the hindmost’ Liberalism would now inculcate a new teaching with regard to the poorest in the community, that all should have what was their due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are reining in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, holding down expenditure, stimulating the private sector and holding down the deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">economy</span> depended mainly on agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, South Australia finished up with a more broadly based and soundly based <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer again to the balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span> which I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia was no longer a rural based State; rather it was a State with a well balanced and sound <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democrats believe that yearly budgets are a disaster and that they are the very last thing that an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a society trying to look ahead to the problems that face us and the world need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be bad enough if once every 12 months on the second Tuesday in August there was a savage change in the direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when the Labor Party took over in December 1972 the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was such that it might have been described as bubbling, which the Labor Government either failed to recognise or refused to acknowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of structural change which takes place in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and which is irresistible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that I mean that if the Government tried to prime the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as some of the contributors to this debate would have us do, the strength of the unions is such, and the attitude of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is such, that wages would rise almost immediately with demand and we would again have galloping inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to major structural changes in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which are tending to reduce the rate of growth of demand for labour in fields which in the past were important for labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is it a realistic assessment of the direction that this country, society and <span class="highlight">economy</span> are travelling but it is also prepared to take, and in fact does take, a relatively hard line in certain areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment was a recognition of the fact that the mothers of Australia make a real contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would it give work and interrupt the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the increase in unemployment, but also it would ensure that Australia would have this important link which is so frequently interrupted because of bad weather. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been demonstrated by Sweden that a country can have a high welfare system, high taxation and a very efficient <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not good for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is very necessary because it reduces the cost of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment and costs are fundamental to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The course of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going instead of knocking the South Australian Premier and saying that the Labor Government has whiskers on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some might say that what I have to say in this debate could have been said during the Budget debate, but there is a specific reason why I would like to make quite a detailed examination of some of the events of recent times and to relate them to what I consider to be the general problems facing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think most of us v/ould be very pleased that finally the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has come clean with the Australian community and has admitted what has been said by the Labor movement for a considerable period about the problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and about the fact that we have reached a stage in our development where unemployment, particularly amongst young people, has become, and will remain for a considerable period, a permanent pan of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some are even prepared to blame the Press for highlighting things which, they say, create difficulties in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and they blame a lack of confidence by those who seek to invest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others would blame the bureaucracy for bad advice, particularly that given by those who advise the Government about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we should be concerned about the direction the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has taken in post-war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a direction which I believe takes from the Government the power to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the extent of the penetration of transnational corporations into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and at the startling dimensions of some of these transnational corporations which have already been set up in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s gross domestic product in 1976-77 was some $82,224m but some of the transnational corporations are larger than this in these terms and combined, of course, they completely dwarf the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sheer magnitude and percentage of such key economic aggregates accounted for by the transnational corporations gives some indication of the influence that these corporations’ decisions have with regard to investment and capital movements and what they mean to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to the economic policies of this Government or, for that matter, any other government, to the monetary and fiscal situation, to the exchange rate, to the balance of payments and to the size and direction of investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no guarantee that decisions taken on that basis or based on that criteria will necessarily be in the best interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Who pays for the resultant instability of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the international <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that that is true in your State of New South Wales,  Mr Deputy President,  in South Australia and particularly in Victoria where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the State is dependent upon the efficiency, maintenance and healthiness of a particular industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many transnational companies, especially those from the United States, entered the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to maintain their market share when tariff barriers hindered their exports to the Australian domestic market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But rather than undertake technological adaptation and produce a plant and a process that was dovetailed to the needs and the situation of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in most cases they merely installed a scaled-down version of the existing overseas plants or they took the other step of underutilisation of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this Government, the Parliament and honourable senators opposite should put that view out of their thinking- the problems are more fundamental than that and mere repetition of rhetoric goes nowhere towards the solution of the more fundamental problems with which we are confronted- if in fact they are genuinely concerned, and I suggest that many honourable senators opposite are, with the problems concerning the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the lack of job opportunities and the permanence that now seems to be part of the unemployment scene in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should resist being integrated into the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> purely as a supplier of agricultural and mineral commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that we should continue to follow policies which ignore the degree of their influence upon our domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator’s Ministers are now saying that they have under-estimated the degree to which unemployment has become a permanent feature in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the extent to which foreign owned companies are able to determine the direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are able to determine in what areas investment funds should be placed, are able to determine whether companies will expand and are able to determine whether jobs will disappear for all time from very important sections of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad that  Senator Gietzelt  has turned this debate in the direction of the future of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the problems of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One key element in the transition of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be our tariff policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are restoring the foundations of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was so recklessly destroyed by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem, of course, is how to prevent inflation through wage pressure from over powerful unions as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> reaches full employment, thus wrecking everything that has been carefully built up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We might be surprised at how much good will and common sense would emerge from a national conference on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, provided that the issues were presented clearly and fairly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found out that all the airlines were booked out for two weeks in both first and <span class="highlight">economy</span> classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The underlying cause of the slump in Canberra’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the decline in the building industry is this Government’s obsessive cost cutting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is in preparing the Budget-  against the background of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that was showing signs of responding positively to our policies of the last two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a further demonstration of the credibility which can be attached to statements on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by senior Ministers in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody, with the possible exception of the Prime Minister, ever doubted that if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> were driven deep enough into recession inflation rates would not come down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree to which the present Budget is anti-inflationary and to which inflation could fall further is entirely dependent upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> being driven deeper into depression, as it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amongst other things, he said that the private sector would grow and that confidence was gradually returning to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the broad Budget parameters, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> could expand more rapidly in 1 978-79 than in 1977-78, providing there is an expansion of private sector demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been the changes to economic circumstances occasioned by international factors- the oil price rise, the problems of weakening international trade, the ever-deepening penetration of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> by major international corporations, the degree of inflation which was triggered off to pay for the involvement of the Western world in wars in the Asian region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Government has no policy which will create more jobs; it has no policy upon which the Australian community can be encouraged to spend; and it has no policy upon which one can see any development of growth in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  went on to make some comments about what the Prime Minister had done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, comments which my natural modesty and sensitivity to the delicate sensibilities of Government senators prevent me from repeating in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some Government senators will recall what  Mr Dunstan  had to say about what the present Prime Minister had done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, but I will not repeat that here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the slow growth in world trade we cannot look to resurgence in general overseas trade and markets to lift our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thus increase employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is time for the Government, as part of its examination of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and as part of its responsibility to our near South East Asian neighbours, to have research carried out, in Treasury, trade, employment and other areas, into the feasibility of an extended South East Asia Pacific community with common economic, trade and defence policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, and subject to the constraints still upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we shall pursue higher levels of economic activity and greater job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a government presents a Budget it is important that there should be some overview of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I responded quite enthusiastically to the fact that the Government, in presenting the Budget, said that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> was now responding positively to policies directed to the basic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reduced inflation, as we all know very well, has relieved pressures and strains throughout the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government might well ask itself whether increased government spending would stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and not contribute to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have talked about cutbacks in government spending, staff ceilings, acrosstheboard cuts and the lack of stimulus and I have shown that this has resulted in a continued winding down of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> air fare from Darwin to Sydney now is $423.80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the two-party system that we could never have any sensible long term planning- the sensible long term planning for which our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is crying out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other respects also- in the interests of an alleged <span class="highlight">economy</span>- money for essential and often overdue research has been cut back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is no <span class="highlight">economy</span> to cut back on necessary investments in one’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea is basically that there should be a third element in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present control on prices is due only to the harsh reining in of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the case almost everywhere throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a document which expresses the Government’s concern to motivate greater private sector growth, and lessen the dependency of the Territory’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> on government sponsored activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that with a low level of inflation in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> an annual increase is the appropriate way to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> continues to face difficulties, the amount of overseas travel could easily be less and thus the estimate of collections could be lower than anticipated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst the present crisis in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is hoped to be temporary, the long run trends indicate that revenue will meet expectations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Callaghan inquiry report into the development of Tasmania indicated that the steady and planned growth of tourism is an important part of the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every dollar that can be brought to South Australia must be regarded as a captive one and is very important in keeping our <span class="highlight">economy</span> afloat at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, no doubt the impact of other government measures in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have an even greater effect on the success of Australian tourism insofar as inflation will be reduced and therefore the costs incurred by people travelling to and within parts of Australia will be reduced and opportunities will flow from people being able to spend their money more easily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, the use of North West Shelf gas by the alumina industry would necessitate energy imports to meet the needs of other sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and there would be a balance of payments cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that the Minister has said that there is no intention to restrict debate on the income tax Bills especially, not that I imagine for one moment that those Bills will have the slightest impact on getting the Government out of the mess in which it finds itself in regard to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The BTE has also examined <span class="highlight">economy</span> class air fares and I am advised by the Department that in those comparisons Australia is in the lower half of the scale for all distances considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resounding swing in that by-election and also the landslide victory in the State election in New South Wales show clearly that the people of Australia are disillusioned by the string of broken promises and the inability of this Government to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the road to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise that these loans are not being negotiated for the purpose of developing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> but simply to support the Australian dollar and finance the deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although that large sum of money will also have to be repaid at least it will be used to develop wealth in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in exactly the same way as the proposed $4,000m loan of the Labor Government in 1974 was intended to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the increased unemployment benefit payable and other commitments mean that any government has to be assured of obtaining adequate revenue without lumping the burden of tax on to a section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or the community which cannot afford to pay it or which is unequally bearing the burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My real fear is that, combined with other measures adopted by this Government, the tax surcharge, which may have to remain for at least two years even though the Government has said that it will be imposed for only one year if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> does not recover, will have an actual and psychological impact on consumer confidence and will comprise the worst Christmas present the Fraser Government has given the Australian people yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the deficit has increased and the tax cuts had to be imposed were as I have given them before in the Senate, and they were eloquently summarised by a former Liberal member of the Victorian Government when he said that  Mr Fraser  had ruined the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the building industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that the Prime Minister had done something else to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but I cannot mention it here because of the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what a responsible Minister, a Minister for many years in the Victorian Liberal Government, had to say about the present Government’s management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is precisely the strategy contained in the Budget which sets out quite clearly the economic objective of encouraging overseas investment and determining a better value for the Australian dollar on the world market, thereby ensuring a growth in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which we are going to create a viable <span class="highlight">economy</span> is by starting all over again from the Whitlam mess and creating a whole, new range of jobs and industrial structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, the decisions that the Government has made in imposing a surcharge of 1.5 per cent for this year only is a very careful but important decision in ensuring the recovery of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the problem for the survival of the market <span class="highlight">economy</span> arises when the voters permit or encourage the expansion of government power to such an extent that private business can gain short-term profits through intervention into the competitive market by government officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given a continuation of good government at State, and Federal levels, as is presently enjoyed, Western Australia will continue to force the pace in our sluggish national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have since retreated from the brink and the difficult task of rejuvenating our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is well under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government- the Liberal and National Country Parties- in Opposition and in government has pursued a consistently responsible line towards the management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government since its election in December 1975 has consistently been responsible to all Australian people in recognising that if our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not well and soundly based then we do not have a country with a soundly based future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that there are benefits for the development of our rural areas, which is the development of our whole nation and whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in allowing people or giving them particular incentives to involve themselves in investment in primary production areas, even if they are not fulltime primary producers, regardless of whether their reason for not being fulltime primary producers is one of choice or one of necessity, as has been the case with many of our beef producers, particularly in Queensland although I think probably also in Western Australia in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government said that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in such a state that we would have to develop the private sector and that to do this we would have to develop consumer demand.- Yet, this’ very strategy is negated by the five Bills that we are considering because $5 60m will be taken out of the hands of the consuming public, particularly out of the hands of those to whom payasyouearn taxation applies, at a time when the Government states that private sector activity is part of its aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well remember stating last November that if the Government pursued its policy of unreasonable contraction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and blind faith in the reduction of the deficit pensions would inevitably suffer and the indexation of pensions twice yearly would go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was borne out in no uncertain terms, firstly, by the results of the Werriwa byelection and, secondly, by the results of the New South Wales State election held about eight or nine days ago when the Fraser Government got a massive rebuff for the way in which it was handling the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and for its treatment not only of the States but of the people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is obsessed with the idea that to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the rails it has to reduce the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying to hoodwink the people into believing that because it has reduced the rate of inflation everything is nice and rosy so far as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> goes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to an article in the  New Statesman  of 14 July which mentions the economic model of the British <span class="highlight">economy</span> used by the British Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in fact a Treasury-Australian Bureau of Statistics model of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> similar, as I am advised, in method of construction, coverage and use to that of the one used in the United Kingdom Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is part of the big business and corporate sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wage and salary earners, not only in their capacity as earners but also in their capacity as consumers, will be unprotected and left high and dry as a result of the inept attitude taken by the Government in this statement which will have the effect of strengthening the big business sector in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It tries to maintain the farce that the PJT still has a role to play in some aspects of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be equally argued that because the Government seems confident of arresting inflation this type of miserly <span class="highlight">economy</span> is of no great value anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said, therefore, that if there were a decline in the Australian manufacturing sector it would be taken up by the service or tertiary sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, just as it had been in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is related to a problem which involves us all throughout the whole community, that is what can be done to ensure that an economic policy can be pursued which will reduce inflation to a level which is manageable so that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be brought out of the period of recession which world economies have experienced and into a position of growth whereby growth in the ABC and various other areas will then be able to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ABC along with many other statutory authorities, government departments and various other sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, has been asked or required to play a part in achieving a result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also recognised that the position of individual countries varied considerably, and that if we were to succeed in steering the OECD <span class="highlight">economy</span> along this so-called ‘narrow path’ some countries would need to concentrate primarily on bringing inflation under control, while others would carry a particular responsibility for maintaining the momentum of the recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is relevant to point out that at a recent meeting of the OECD it was accepted that Australia was still one of the countries which fell into the category of having to concentrate at this stage on bringing inflation under control and that nine other member countries of the OECD were recognised as being in a position to play a more expansionary role in bringing the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> into better shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These include the impact of technological change and the restructuring of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our economic activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to sum up my contribution to this debate by saying that it is acknowledged that the ABC, any more than anybody else in the community, has not had it easy over the past two or three years while this attempt to bring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back under control and get it going in the right direction has been taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that there is no possibilitycertainly no evidence has been produced by the Government- that there will be any gain in efficiency or <span class="highlight">economy</span> after the introduction of such a method of payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we wish to give incentives to <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the use of drugs and hospitalisation- as we surely should- the Minister should provide that health maintenance organisations should receive, for each contributor the average amount spent per head of the community by the Government on drugs and private hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the ultimate hybrid of a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>- institutionally overefficient without any of the traditional checks upon its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is totally lopsided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, much of this will be transferred to the Australian elite and to the trans-national corporations, which are receiving the greatest benefits from the re-organisation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This in itself would give a great boost to employment and a great injection into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of South Australia, which is reflected through the whole of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember  Senator Laucke,  the  President  of the Senate, pointing out during final comments at the briefing that it was highly important that a nonpartisan attitude be adopted towards a very important project for South Australia which will also be of value to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been noted by me and by other honourable senators that South Australia has a unique sort of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government consider the Uren statement as a threat to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and possibly the future security of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcome the Government’s belated recognition of the truth of what we were saying, of the accuracy of the Opposition’s diagnosis of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the limited degree to which the Government has adopted the policies long advocated by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the people of Australia that in that period inflation rose to 18 per cent, interest rates soared to unprecedented heights, the short term lending market was in a desperate situation, the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> was overheated and the primary producers, along with others, had enormous difficulties because of basic costs in getting their goods onto world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the question of finance for the rural sector has worried that sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, there is every indication that the Attorney-General is simply hoping that the new stringent <span class="highlight">economy</span> measures which he has introduced will make it possible for economies to be exercised over the next few months and thus that it will not be necessary for the commitment level to be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of our economists refer to the ‘inefficient manufacturing sector’ of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but in so doing ignore five important factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner we find an alternative fuel to oil the more insulated the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will become and the less vulnerable it will be to the political manipulations of the oil exporting countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Being an island State, and despite its convivial and envied life style, structural changes, regrettably, have not assisted its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the dilemmas in a private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> is the difficulty of getting employers to work in tandem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found the report which came into our hands of very great significance and interest in outlining the difficulties which the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> faces and which it will face for years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it puts into proper context the directional changes that have occurred in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the longer term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will just give a few more statistics to demonstrate the effects on the various sections of the labour force and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> insofar as they have been affected by changes within the various sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we compare the percentages of the work force which have been involved in the various sectors, we find that in 1 950-5 1 rural industry accounted for 14 per cent of the work force whereas in 1977 the percentage had dropped to 6.4 per cent; the mining industry accounted for 2 per cent of the work force in 1950-5 1 but the percentage had dropped to 1.3 per cent in 1977; manufacturing industry accounted for 29 per cent of the work force in 1 950-5 1 but in 1 977 the percentage had dropped to 21.6 per cent, a drop of about one-quarter on the 1950 figure which is a very significant change in the light of the very great growth that has occurred in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the manufacturing sector since the end of World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly that area has been the most significant area of growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over those 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the forces that are working to move jobs from one sector to another, it is quite clear that while there has been a very significant period of boom in those 25 years when viewed in the longer term, there have been very great changes with people moving from one sector to another upon incentives that have occurred more or less naturally in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of increasing profits in one sector as against another and increasing developments brought about by definite government policy; for instance, the encouragement of development in regional areas, in sections of States and indeed in some States as against others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pretty fair to say that had the recession not occurred and had the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> remained as buoyant as it was in the 1960s and early 1970s very little would have been heard of the problem of structural change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice it to say that, during that discussion, the point was made that change in manufacturing industry in Australia was necessary, albeit on a gradual basis and after having established a firm foundation for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that significant changes can occur with the least possible social and economic disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to face the possibility that some industries may move because of natural pressures in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from imported goods and cheaper labour available outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in remaining protected behind high tariff walls without paying regard to the serious pressures which the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is under and which will continue until the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast, this Government has now borrowed more than $3,500m overseas and there is a likelihood that if there is no real recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that sum could become $5,000m within the next 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a pertinent interjection because I was about to say that in the 1948 case before the Arbitration Court, when the unions argued for a reduction in the working week from 44 hours to 40 hours, those very arguments were put forward- that the costs would be so great that the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be sent broke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  is so worried about what is taking place in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and at the way in which his back bench committees are behaving that he had to go on national television the other night to endeavour to soft soap the electors about the wonderful job this Government is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that all this is possible and there is an uplift in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> because inflation is down, costs have stabilised and Australian manufacturing industry is more competitive in our own market and in export markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been pointed out by many financial experts, money has to be injected into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for public works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Government is prepared to cut back public expenditure as people from the building industry told me last Friday, it will not get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the rails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not to say that we will not, in three or five years time, undertake further surveys in respect of foreign participation in various sectors of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will still have information on foreign investment in Australia in total, but the abondonment for the moment of the foreign participation studies will mean that we do not have more detailed information on particular sectors of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Statutory authorities of various sorts are dealing with huge amounts of public finance in a way which is very significant in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Will the new <span class="highlight">economy</span> rate, which will apply after 26 November to STD calls made between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. every day, also apply to booked long distance calls? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why, initially, we focussed on Aborigines living in or near an urban environment, on the empirical evidence that they had elected to live and work in close contact with the European dominated market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The share of resources in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> devoted to public capital expenditure declined from a high of 10 per cent in 1965-66 to less than 8 per cent in 1 973-74. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the elimination of the hospital building program altogether and the very severe cuts in housing allocations for welfare housing and co-operative housing, it all adds up to an enormously damaging blow to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as we see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot really believe that this is what you consider to be a satisfactory recovery for the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wriedt  would agree, that is having consequent dislocating effects upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is one of the main factors that we cannot get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving and reduce unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully, within that time the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have recovered, prices for copper will continue to improve and the necessity to shift large numbers of people away from the west coast of Tasmania should have diminished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has made the point that if the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> was considerably healthier, it would be possible to find alternative employment for people who might be displaced on the west coast and have to leave Queenstown and Gormanston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it affords an opportunity for the Senate, certainly for the Opposition, to chip away at the myth that the deficit has to be cut at all costs, to chip away at the inadequate philosophy that this Government is pursuing in its economic program and to chip away at the unacceptable theory that the deficit has to be reduced or the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not get going again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were, one would have expected that the Government would be spending more money on roads because better road surfaces provide better fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> for motor vehicles; vehicles move more quickly, with more efficiency, and there is less delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers will recall previous questions asked by me in which I have indicated that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has said in a number of statements that it would take part in a national conference on unemployment and that  Mr Hawke  has stated more recently that he and his associated authorities are quite prepared to sit down with the Government and confer about the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not supporting that particular position; but there is increasing evidence that, in spite of the Prime Minister  (Mr Fraser)  trying to ‘talk up’ the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, other influential sections of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are privately expressing the same reservations as the association to which I have just referred expressed in its annual report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about some small-time, billy cart operation, but about one of the major industries of this country, one upon which in a sense the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is now based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not there because we have a Government that has been totally incapable of facing up to the problem of there being no jobs; a Government unwilling to do so; a Government that has been totally ineffectual in stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that jobs can be created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last three years the nation’s capital has changed from being a growth centre into perhaps one of the most stagnant areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, certainly the city with one of the most stagnant employment situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the immediate problem of those who are unemployed, there has been sufficient new activity in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to take up those who are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the good news that the inflation rate is down and the latest good news that has just been released that Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd has stated that in the six months to the end of October its domestic orders were up to 28 per cent on the previous six months augur well for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is righted, once wages are stabilised then we will see a movement to a better employment standard than we have had in the last six years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other proposition which she put forward was that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should be stimulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened very carefully to what  Senator Ryan  had to say in this debate and her only comment about this problem was that jobs are not there simply because the Government is not stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to create jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Opposition’s proposal is that jobs should be created by stimulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now living in an entirely different <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a different social economic order, a different technological order from that of the past, the classic economic cures which the Government is putting forward just will not solve the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not asking the trade unions to give up penalty rates for nothing but why can the Government and the employers not get together with the trade unions and say to them that penalty rates, and indeed casual rates, are destroying the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and sending many decent people out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a factor of our isolation in Australia that we tend to think that even the most modest advance in industrial relations or provisions of service is somehow a dreadfully radical measure that will bring about the downfall of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, particularly at the moment, our <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot stand that sort of flow on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is changing- its <span class="highlight">economy</span>, its people, its social customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard him say and I also read his comment that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> was on the correct course, and in my presence he added that Australia was setting something of an example to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is vital that these links remain open so that we can export and import our goods at times most favourable to our seasons, to our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to our balance of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind  Senator Button  that such development would bring benefits not only in revenue and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> but also in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish only to add that in opposing the Bills we do so in the knowledge that they have been introduced by a Government that is in real trouble, particularly with its revenue, because of the manner in which it has mishandled the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the manner in which the revenue has run down because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has run down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the loss of 31,800 tonnes could be absorbed via additional sales of wine, which is highly unlikely because of varietal mix, then total wine sales would have to grow by 11.2 per cent between 1977-78 and 1978-79, and this appears too optimistic an outlook when considering the general state of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other consideration which should be given some weight is that this is a revenue Bill and that a government in the House of Representatives has the right to determine the guidance the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should have and to determine how it should raise its revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not demur in anyway on that issue and thoroughly support the Government and its objective to bring down inflation and restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any people responding to those advertisements expect to get free beer on a Qantas <span class="highlight">economy</span> flight ticket they are in for a shock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Passengers with <span class="highlight">economy</span> class Qantas tickets do not get free beer as do such passengers on certain other international airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister tell the Senate whether Qantas intends to make the beer really flow free on <span class="highlight">economy</span> class, as some other airlines do, and, what is more important, make no charge for in-flight services such as the provision of earphones and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objective of such Committee would be to achieve maximum <span class="highlight">economy</span> through interdepartmental standardisation, subject to not restricting competition among suppliers or limiting the Commonwealth’s ability to capitalise on technical innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Similarly I believe that most, if not all, of the laws under which we live are of a nature that we, if truly free and democratic people, have a duty and obligation to change, mould and fit to the changing circumstances of the society and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The object of the provision is to prevent people from getting together and boycotting some of the really fundamental aspects of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, such as overseas trade and the export of goods from this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The period 1973 to 1975 was characterised by rampant inflation which had dislocating effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and on the financial arrangements of businesses and governments alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-110-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In particular the proliferation of statutory authorities in these countries and Australia has raised the question of governmental activity becoming excessive in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the lives of ordinary citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation has created considerable problems, both for the Executive Government in effectively managing Australia’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and administration, and for the Parliament in ensuring that the authorities’ ultimate accountability to the people is maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a consequence, the total impact which authorities have on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is hard to measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, the ability of the Government to effectively manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is reduced by not having complete control over finances which are obtained and employed by organisations essentially owned by the taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission sees its purpose as to supplement other measures to provide landed property for groups which have been dispossessed, which have not had access to a share of the Australian national estate by inheritance, and which have little if any chance to acquire property by participation in the western <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had no incentives, no stimulation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and virtually no spending in the public sector, unlike the situation which has existed in the Australian Capital Territory when definite steps have been taken to make sure that building firms did not go to the wall and that employment was created for those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great many pensioners have examined all the circumstances of this decision and I believe that very largely they are prepared to admit that the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to pay and the direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>- to control inflation above all thingshave been such that what was selected as Government policy for 1978-79 was after all, a reasonably responsible move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reduction in the rate of inflation is the most significant contribution that this Government or any government can make for the welfare of all the people- pensioners and all others alike- in the context of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am certain that the circumstances of the pensioners will remain a prime objective of this Government but I am equally sure that the pensioners themselves will recognise in the last resort that their income is related to the total efficiency of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If governments of that day had taken the short-sighted approach that has been taken by this Government since it has come to office then we would never have built our transport infrastructure which has played such an important and significant part in the development of our industries and of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the last 100 years or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an indictment of this Government that it should follow so glibly and so blindly the false premise that all it has to do is reduce public sector spending and the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be back on an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A strong and prosperous Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is vital if we are to achieve the goals we all share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that 1979 is the year in which the fruits of our policies will become clearly apparent, a year in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will take a further step on the road to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By strengthening the foundations of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, this Government is taking the most realistic, effective and concerned approach towards providing more jobs for Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After three years of steady policies directed at overcoming inflation and rebuilding the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the signs of progress are clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential part of it lies in the second paragraph in which, referring to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and signs of recovery, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has failed to indicate that much of the expenditure went overseas and the equipment was purchased from northern hemisphere suppliers, so there was no multiplier effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Prime Minister has failed to say is that the Australian export industries are benefiting from the problems of the United States <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the outlook in that direction is not at all hopeful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian dollar has been devalued by over 20 per cent since Labor lost office and unless there is a substantial structural improvement in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> we will be faced with either further devaluation of the dollar or more overseas borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he fails to say is that many of these projects will not be commenced for two or three years and it would be foolish to expect any flow-on to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> earlier than 1980 or 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Government by its declaration of intention in the 1978 legislation would clearly have liked to have made these additional funds available in the current year and in the following financial year where there is some reduction, it has been decided that it is in the best interests of Australia and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> that these payments should be postponed; that, quite simply, is what this Bill is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would go further and say that we regard it as essential to the strategy of any political party that is in government to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to a healthy state in a world in which we will face- I must stress this point- increasing competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since governments believe in the general proposition that the market can do no wrong, they are caught off-balance in the face of accelerating inflation and act in panic when corrective recessions imposed on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> fail to remove inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Triffin, writing in  World <span class="highlight">Economy</span>,  expresses a view which is pessimistic on the whole, as is the view of many other economic experts throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, planning on the basis suggested by the Australian Democrats would be a continuous process, with continued consultation between the major forces in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that there are those innocents who would reply that planning is not necessary, that one needs only to leave the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the natural forces of the market place and all will be well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The comments made last week by authoritative spokesmen in Iran, to the effect that that country will get back into the exporting business as quickly as possible, ought to be encouragement for us to accept that that country under its new government, whatever it is, will act responsibly and recognise the importance of its resources to the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">economy</span> picks up and confidence returns to the private sector the Government expects that there will be some upturn in investment in the longer term activities in which research and development expenditure is a very important part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From the examples I have given it can be seen that there are some very encouraging indications that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at last is getting back onto sound levels of activity and that there is considerable support for the policies that the Government has been following. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the basic solution to those problems will come with the development of a sound and strong <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and the creation thereby of solid and secure jobs for all those in the community who wish to take advantage of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Audit Bill is, in part, a response to public expectation that increased <span class="highlight">economy</span> must be practised in the area of government operations where transactions are increasing in volume and, in many cases, also in unit cost, with the result that the necessary funding is taking a growing proportion of gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were to consider this proposition of selling TAA, I believe that the time is right to try to engage a greater degree of flexibility and competition and to take the opportunity to improve the workings of our private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the approach of the communists or other people who do not put at the foremost the private enterprise system as the best system likely to make an <span class="highlight">economy</span> work satisfactorily for the people who are involved in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In coming to power, after the economically disastrous Whitlam-Hayden period, the Liberal coalition government promised to reduce big government and to promote a healthy private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The removal or reduction of such policies would significantly enhance the prospects for growth in the international <span class="highlight">economy</span> and international trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is essential to a modern <span class="highlight">economy</span>, something we hope we will have the benefit of creating after the present Government is defeated at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is absolutely crucial in terms of the perceived needs of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the remaining years of this century that we have a first class communications system of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party does not believe and has never believed that the Prices Justification Tribunal should be used as a weapon against private enterprise companies acting within a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government to establish a control over business which had not been witnessed in this country before but which, as we all know, stifled investment, reduced the creation of job capacity within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and led to the disastrous results of 1975 and the unemployment which persists today.- Quite apart from those particular matters this Bill will lift a lot of the weight from the shoulders of businesses which have been forced, in a very strictive way, to produce information at great cost to the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not be able to distance itself from the approval of price increases that will flow into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because the Prices Justification Tribunal is now clearly seen to be an instrument of government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not merely the socially responsible thing to do to instil confidence in consumers; even on the Liberal Government’s own premises it is also the sensible thing to do to ensure the best functioning of market <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it be the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Trade Practices Commission, the Government is determined to eliminate any independent forces at work within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, as will be seen from its federal platform, is committed to a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but it says that those who operate in a mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span> by way of contributing, accumulations of private capital ought to get a return which will allow them to invest in further capital works and employment opportunities to be created within the enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill represents the abandonment of the consumers of this nation by a government which in the next breath will encourage consumers to go out and purchase Australian goods so as to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If consumers lack confidence- a basic ill of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>- much of the blame must rest on the shoulders of the Minister who is meant to plead their cause in Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the types of increases that have occurred since the time whenMalcolm Fraser said that he was going to stabilise the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to keep prices down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact if one has any feeling for history or any sentiment about Norfolk Island one cannot but reflect a very strong sentiment for the interests and wishes of the Pitcairn Island people on Norfolk Island, the population of that island having been diluted, as it were, by various refugees from Australia, whether they be tax dodgers or retired people, who in a sense have had a very significant effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Norfolk Island and who perhaps have too much say in the running of Norfolk Island to the detriment of the Pitcairn Island people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Norfolk Island has its own economic problems and circumstances and it would be wrong for us to impose upon it standards which were not applicable to the particular situation of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In extending Australian social security legislation to the island we would have to take account again of the particular problems which exist there, but we should take account also of the levels of payment and the indexing of pensions in a way which is appropriate to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the island and to the conditions which pertain there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">economy</span> is over-supplied by labour from outside, the unemployed on Norfolk Island get no government benefit and must leave the island if they wish to continue to live, and those holding permits to stay and work are obliged to leave immediately if they lose their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again we cannot impose Australian solutions on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Norfolk Island, but this legislation which the Government has introduced really shows no recognition at all of this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this context I approved the introduction of standby fares last year which are discounted by 30 per cent below the <span class="highlight">economy</span> fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition a new Super Apex scheme providing a 40 per cent discount on the return <span class="highlight">economy</span> fare has been introduced for certain periods of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of this study rests on the fact that physical distribution costs the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Representative samples are developed for these surveys and consequently, all industries are encompassed in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not have to look very far to appreciate the one-sided approach that this Government has taken in respect of taxation, particularly in relation to those in the corporate and mining sectors of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, employment decreased and there were tremendous consequences for our balance of payments and the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, the emphasis is on simplicity and <span class="highlight">economy</span> in collection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory Government got the cut to which it thought it was entitled, but I should have thought that it would be far more important to have the money flowing into the community and achieving the stimulation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is so important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is unbelievable that a government would create additional uncertainty to that which is already apparent in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has had control of the Treasury for  Vh  years, yet it cannot even tell us the State of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or the state of the public accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method by which this will be achieved is at present under active consideration by my Department and me NH &amp; MRC and by those concerned with our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the longer term Batt said he was sure the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> would present a picture of ‘enormous strength ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When does the Government intend to adopt policies to restore the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to encourage full employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is also the responsibility of the Government to see that, in the words of Scotton, these are not irresponsible economic policies, policies which would cause damage to future employment prospects or damage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the community as we saw happen in the years of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, can the Minister reconcile this situation with the fact that on a flight of a similar distance, from Melbourne to Launceston, such services are in fact provided to <span class="highlight">economy</span> class passengers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most importantly I think at this stage, it is necessary presumably to put the past behind us and try to rebuild the shattered state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as well as the society of Uganda.This raises a question of what we might do to assist that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances I would have thought that sensible government would have said: ‘Well, that is the set of policies we have applied to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for three and a half years and that is the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the demand for goods and services is equal or near equal to the supply of goods and services and you inject more money into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> you have the classical demandinflation situation of too much money chasing too few goods and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this Senate is of the opinion that the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, is a fraud and a thief, that he has lied about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that in 1971-72, because of the mismanagement by the McMahon Government, which could not handle the economic crisis of that period, the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> was on the downturn and was having its effects upon Australia and the Australian people took advantage of the situation to change the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final part of  Senator Button’s  question may be answered in this way: The one miscalculation that the Government made was to underestimate the extent of the damage done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the three years of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 also remind honourable senators of my answer that it is on the fiscal, or financial, management of the deficit and of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole that the Government should be judged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is not opposing the Bills on the grounds that it is not the Wheat Board’s fault that the Government has lost control ofthe money supply and has shown itself incompetent in managing the money supply and the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is not the Boards’ fault that the Government lost control of the money supply in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Opposition is not opposing the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt that we need to debate those Bills at length because of their serious effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that in exactly the same way as governments were motivated to establish and support the Clyde Cameron College, in the belief that people operating in the trade union sector ought to have access to a greater degree of expertise, to greater assistance and to greater resources in order to allow them to fulfil their proper role within the educational and industrial sector, so I am sure that Australian management will benefit from taking a more intelligent and more scientific approach to the role it has to play in the mixed <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications a question which refers to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> rates for subscriber trunk dialling telephone calls which are made between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that, when Queensland telephone subscribers wish to call telephone subscribers in southern States at times when daylight saving operates, the earliest a connection can be made at <span class="highlight">economy</span> rates in the evening is 10 o’clock eastern summer time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister ask Telecom Australia to investigate whether it will be possible to vary appropriately the times for <span class="highlight">economy</span> STD rates in Queensland when daylight saving time next operates in the southern States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there are many more intrastate calls made in comparison with interstate calls, the proposal to provide for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> rate to apply lo all calls originated in Queensland between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. eastern standard time during daylight saving periods would mean- the application of a low rate to calls originated in Queensland during a period of reasonably high traffic loading between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. eastern standard time with a resultant increase in traffic during that period; and the application of the maximum day rate on all calls made in Queensland between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. eastern standard time which isa period of low traffic volume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 9 August 1978 a very astute and courageous Liberal who understood that these programs were completely phoney-  Mr Dunstan,  a Minister in the Hamer Victorian Government- had certain things to say about the attitude of the Prime Minister to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan also accused  Mr Fraser  of ruining the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the building industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the article,  Mr Dunstan  then used a colloquial expression to describe what  Mr Fraser  had done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that 1979 is the year in which the fruits of our policies will become clearly apparent, a year in which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will take a further step on the road to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be described only as incompetent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear, of course, without reiterating and putting too fine a point on it, that the economic ills generated in the years of the Whitlam Labor Government still exist in many ways in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is those matters which, through the mechanism of wage indexation, are still generating inflation within the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite may well argue that that is not relevant to rates of inflation applicable to Australia, but it would be recognised perhaps by the more enlightened honourable senators on that side that in 1 979 with regard to imported inputs into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> the situation is significantly different from the situation in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a very imprudent government which decided to allow the money supply to increase more and more rapidly in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> while it would be possible that those impacts would have an effect on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the months ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, it was necessary- which necessity was well judged by the Fraser Government- to take action at the time it saw fit to do so, namely 24 May, to introduce measures which would restrict the growth in the money supply and apply some restraint on the growth of expenditures by the Federal Government to ensure that inflation did not increase at rates that might jeopardise the future health of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, it would have been irresponsible for the Government, by allowing full tax indexation and the removal of the tax surcharge on 1 July, to have pumped $ 1,600m into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> from 1 July over the next 12-month period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against the background that I have just sketched that would have been an irresponsible action and, consequently, it was proper that the Government delay a final decision with regard to those two matters along the lines that have been outlined in the speech made by the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  to ensure that the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not be inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Malcolm Fraser told us that we should have faith in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and we should go out and spend to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basic promise that this Government made to every Australian when it came to office was that it would remedy the tremendous shemozzle into which the Australian Labor Party had got the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government is seen as a responsible Government which is sticking to its original, most important commitment to the Australian people- to right the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of these changes inflationary pressures increase and there is a clear need for Government action to maintain control over the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, particularly so since the 5 per cent inflation forecast in Budget statement No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from failing to reduce expenditure as promised, apart from failing to rein in inflation, and apart from failing to rectify our overseas borrowing situation, it has also failed to instil real confidence into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> for greater investment by industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one adds to that group the pensioners with children whose dependants’ allowances also have not been increased since 1975 one finds that those people in the community are being affected severely by inflation and by the failure of the Government to recognise that and to compensate them for the inflationary forces in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government welcomes foreign portfolio investment because it injects additional capital resources into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> without diminishing Australian control of local companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it now Government policy to encourage Australian car makers to go on indefinitely marketing vehicles such as the Holden Commodore S/LE and the Ford Fairlane which have fuel consumptions as low as 1 1  1/2  miles to the gallon, even though their parent companies are already marketing in the United States of America the new generation of high <span class="highlight">economy</span>, light weight, front wheel drive cars? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In January 1976, a paper put to the Fraser Cabinet by the Treasury Department pointed out that the formula introduced by the Labor Government virtually ensured that over the longer term the grants would grow faster than the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the Commonwealth’s failure to manage the <span class="highlight">economy</span> proved to be a major stumbling block. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Lusaka, Heads of Government recognised that a continuation of slow growth in the global <span class="highlight">economy</span> would further damage the prospects of increasing living standards in both developed and developing countries, and could have adverse effects in their political and social structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the presentation of each annual Budget by a Federal Government, it would be the normal expectation of most members of the community that a basic objective of each Budget would be to correct those trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which are working against the interests of the majority of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have listened to these arguments from  Mr Fraser  now for  Vh  years and, despite the fact that they have been demonstrated to fail, exactly the same thinking has been pursued in this Budget and it will have exactly the same results: Declining purchasing power by everyone in the community; higher unemployment; and, as has now been revealed by the Australian Taxpayers’ Association, higher taxation for everyone- a combination of the three least desired factors in any <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The public sector has expanded relative to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole under the present Government, accounting for over 38 per cent of gross domestic product compared with an average of less than 34 per cent under the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have assumed that, in the current uncertainty and depressed state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, this year’s Budget would have faced up to the task of rescuing the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> from deepening recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They knew why in 1975 and 1977, and nothing that  Mr Hayden  says now suggests that the Australian Labor Party has learned the lesson of the disastrous effect of its policies on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the broad spectrum of the Budget and see how it fits the developing trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> not only in Australia but also throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That has been accepted very well in the financial markets which are the source of investment capital for further job creation activities within the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having recognised that there is a substantial move for increased investment in new plant, mineral activities and resource development projects throughout Australia, it is of the greatest concern to the people of South Australia and to my fellow senators from that State-  Senator Teague, Senator Jessop,  the  President, Senator Sir Condor  Laucke, and  Senator Young-  that this sort of improvement in our domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not happening in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure is for the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not trying to be political; I am trying to make the point that here is an opportunity for the people of South Australia to ensure that more jobs are created so as to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of that State moving and to ensure that it plays a full part in Australia’s continuing recovery and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tourist dollar goes around in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> more than virtually any other dollar spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably the Australian Labor Party conducts 2HD with as much success as it conducted the <span class="highlight">economy</span> when it had control of it, or would if it had control of it again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these sums seem trifling to honourable senators on the Government side, perhaps it is because they do not understand that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of many families is now literally balanced on a knife edge and as costs rise steadily, is deteriorating, not improving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of no use believing that simple non-expenditure on the law reform commissions is a way of saving government revenue, because if the net effect of that is to bring about a situation in which valuable proposals for law reform are not brought forward, we will find in the not too distant future that that is an extremely false <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and refers to recent offers by  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to confer with the Government about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, wages and jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, yesterday at the ACTU conference he expressed his position even more directly when he said that the ACTU and its officers were available to discuss with the Government matters of importance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including unemployment and jobs, in the hope that some of the issues which confront Australia today might be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, does it intend again not to accept the offer from  Mr Hawke  in respect of the more important matters affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the contribution to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the Vietnamese was bolstering their capacity to sustain militarism and to sustain the kind of wars that they were waging against the Kampucheans in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall health of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> depends both on our response to these issues and our management of longer-term issues, such as trade and industry development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sustained health of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> depends on enlightened and mutually compatible responses by governments to both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problems of adjustment in our domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>, whilst not insignificant, must be weighed against the benefits that would result from our participation in the expansion of trade within the Asian region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have tended to see Budgets as being the most important economic instrument, in some respects the only economic instrument, to enable us to have a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are entitled to analyse whether those Budget speeches realised their objectives and expectations, or whether they are just rhetoric, words which sound good but which are meaningless in terms of having a healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That full threeyear term has come and gone, and the statements by  Mr Howard  do not give us much confidence that the Government is in command of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I refer more particularly perhaps to overseas capital, where we have the rather odious spectacle of Premiers hawking their States around the world trying to get foreign investment in the belief- in my opinion the false belief- that this will lead to investment decisions which will create a more healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span>, ignoring the fact that there are other important decision-making processes which will even cut across those particular investment decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to be an investment-led recovery and special steps were to be taken to encourage the private sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> to invest in new machines, to increase productivity, and generally to create a great concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that if puny little Australia with a population of about 14 million were somehow to change its protection policies and open its doors and adopt the principles of free trade all the other things would fall into place and in fact we would live in a healthy, regenerative and developing Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not suggest in any way that they understand the ramifications of modern economics, but when there are downturns in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, whenever there is unemployment, uncertainty and inflation, historical statistics show that savings bank deposits continue to rise year by year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government are the poor, the unemployed and the pensioner- those in the community who are the weakest, the least able to defend themselves and the first in line to be affected by government policies and by those who refuse to invest and refuse to have confidence in their own capacities to develop the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to read only the financial columns of our newspapers to see that it is the major corporations that are benefiting by this Government’s policies, the corporate rich, the multinational mining companies, the giant oil companies, the companies that have so diversified their activities in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the companies that have gone off-shore in order to develop a higher rate of profitability overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we all know that in excess of 250,000 jobs have disappeared in Australia over the last two years, principally because of the decline in the private sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could be sure that businesses would respond to these handouts the Government could perhaps be justified, but as the figures indicate and as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> shows the private sector is not responding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>identify sectors within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which there are shortages and oversupplies of human skills; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: Does he not agree that this has a very dampening effect on the South Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It carried the message to transport, building and industry that energy frugal design was essential, without sending the inflationary shock through the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that 1 978 and subsequent policy has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clearly, these were the points that were made: Of the intending anti-Labor voters, 83 per cent were concerned about the state of the local <span class="highlight">economy</span>; 86 per cent were concerned - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It intends to do that just when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is beginning to recover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator would have the gullible belief that the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in South Australia is the product of the actions of a Labor Government in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Seantor  WALSH- Perhaps the gullible South Australian senators who are cackling ‘hear, hear’ can explain the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot imagine why that should be so, any more than I can imagine that the theory that government interference inevitably improves an <span class="highlight">economy</span> has any basic validity which can be demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the socialist parties of Europe are far ahead of the socialist party in Australia- the Australian Labor Party- because they have virtually abandoned the idea that by continually interfering with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and manipulating everything governments can do better for the people than the people would otherwise do in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is accepted in most parts of the modern world that we do not produce more by attacking the producers; we do not produce more in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> such as ours by saying: ‘We will take away the incentive from those who are willing to produce extra efforts, work harder and have greater capacities’ and then equalise everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The impression that was being given was that somehow, by attacking the higher income people, one succeeds in covering the problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It might be recalled by honourable senators that last evening when I was speaking on the Budget I was endeavouring to make the point that the Budget has to be seen as only one of the instruments which determine the level of economic activity in this country, but in fact it has a limited influence on the course which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> takes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made the point that in the operation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a modern industrial society the real basic decisions about growth, development, the course the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should follow and the creation of jobs depend largely on decisions which are made privately and not publicly- decisions which are made by major corporations on whether they shall invest here or there, whether their capital will leave this country and go off-shore to Asia, or whether the building of steel mills, oil exploration or other major projects will be undertaken by those owners of capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred also to the fact that, in addition to those influences, international influences were considerably affecting the course being followed in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned that changes in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are taking place against the background of a series of Budgets which have placed emphasis on capital and not labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the Budgets which have been characteristic of the Fraser Administration, including the current Budget which is a Howard-Fraser Budget, can be described only as class Budgets insofar as they seek to take in taxation from the common pool of income in Australia a greater proportion from the pockets of the wage earners and to redistribute that money in the form of incentives for big business or the big corporate sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One only has to look at the balance sheets of numerous major organisations in that sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> to see that their profit ratios have been boosted as a result of the incentives provided in past Budgets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding those incentives, the fact is that the growth factor is not significant enough to overcome the difficulties present in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such is the concern in the community now that many economists, organisations such as the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, many people in universities and even many people who generally can be described as conservative in their thinking are beginning to show some signs of concern about what is happening in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly so in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is as concentrated as that of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this is combined with tariff policies that are progressively destroying an independent Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is clearly true that this Government’s policy is the most disastrous in Australia ‘s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget continues the inept, inadequate and incorrect policies of the first Fraser Budget which was brought in in 1976 and in which the Government expressed confidence that the business sector would take up the slack, that consumers would begin to spend and that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> would get on an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four years later in its fourth Budget the Government knows that unemployment is up, that inflation is beginning to rise again, that there is a lack of business confidence in this country- except in the big corporate sector- that the small business sector is reeling as a result of the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that the average Australian has no confidence in the Budget’s strategy or in its objectives of trying to get some health back into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At times I wonder whether it is the wish of these people that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> be eroded and destroyed, and that the country go into a depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the honourable senator had been fair and had taken a balanced look at the situation he would have gone across the line and examined the militant unionism system, which today is making irresponsible raids upon our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The official who guides the strike can be seen to be living on the cream of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can assume is that militant unionism in Australia wishes to destroy the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So because of its industrial significance in its own right, particularly as a manufacturer, and its dependence on markets outside the State, the South Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot be considered in isolation from what is happening in the rest of Australia, and in turn in the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As South Australia’s manufacturing industry relies on the other States, unemployment did not affect South Australia until it increased in the other States, which could not buy the white goods that are the mainstay of its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Corcoran has tried to blame the Federal Government for the sick <span class="highlight">economy</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though there is hope of survival in the rest of Australia because of the upturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> through good budgeting and the fiscal policies of the Fraser Government, South Australia is the only State in Australia that presently is going backwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government has been blamed tonight for the state of the South Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knowsthe dogs are barking it- that this Government, since it has been in power, has cut back on almost every sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia is dependent upon the total Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that until the state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is improved, until some of the restrictions imposed by the Federal Government are relieved, the unemployment situation will not improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that if the Labor Party in South Australia could identify those parts of the State’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> which are being affected by national policies, it should do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rundown in the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> has resulted in the sort of effect in South Australia that I have spoken about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know, and honourable senators opposite know, that for many months Bob Hawke has been saying that, if the Australian Government would agree, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with its advisers and its economists, would sit around the table with the Government and discuss the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, jobs and employment, and that they would be only too happy to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the mismanagement of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the men who stand up and criticise the Fraser-Anthony Government today demonstrated that they had no capacity to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter of <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the difficulties which are present in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one area which is not only creating employment opportunities but is also a valuable means of balancing our trade and making a contribution towards the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three great companies, Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd and Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd, are all very significant contributors to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timber industry has changed much as a result of the changes in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> since I was elected to this place at the beginning of 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improvement in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the value of the Australian currency to a reasonable world parity level, coupled with the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme, helped the industry to pick up tremendously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tasmania still has a changing <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look back some 30 years, I suppose, we will find that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Tasmania was built around dairying, apples, potatoes, wool, textiles, minerals and timber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many of those industries have suffered the ravages of freight costs and changes of various sorts that I believe that in the 1980s we will have to look to an <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is built around tourism, modern mining of various sorts, timber, the processing of timber and timber products, some improved primary industry, wherever possible, and, I hope, various craft industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Young Committee and the Callaghan Committee of Inquiry into the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation in Tasmania saw forestry as a very important part of Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These few but important statistics indicate the significance of the industry to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Tasmania especially, because of the importance of forestry operations to the State, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is unduly penalised by the outmoded Income Tax Assessment Act under which we are operating at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this country is able to rise along an economic and social course which takes it somewhere close to the maximum of its capacity it becomes a successful <span class="highlight">economy</span>, a nation which not only benefits its own people but also is able to contribute to greater prosperity all round the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the working of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the society, it is absolutely important that there is a proper and real measure of confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a direct result, the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been improving for some time now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we recognise that, in a democracy, the ability of any Government to shape the directions of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is limited by the attitudes and actions of the individual groups within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence of the damage caused to our industries and to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is still apparent despite the fact that under this Government there has been a marked improvement in the standard of industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such, they are an affront to our democratic process and a deliberate attempt to undermine the effective functioning of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing could illustrate more clearly the domination of the extreme left, and their total unconcern for the effects of their policies on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, on the 18th of February this year, he said, ‘For their part, the unions must accept that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> cannot bear unreasonable wage claims’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that if Government, employers and unions are willing to place the national interest first, there is no reason why all parties cannot cooperate to get the most out of what the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> has to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt, in an attempt to redress the imbalance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has come out strongly in support of much greater liberalisation of trade and substantial restructuring of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that conference, Western industralised states continued to argue that the general economic condition was quite satisfactory and denied that the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> was undergoing any crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They argued that the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in a state of crisis as a result of profound structural changes affecting development and international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Leader of the Government to the many previous answers in the Senate relating, as he would put it, to indices of business confidence and revival in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government concerned about this apparent decline in business confidence in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This failure of the Government to honour its promise to lower interest rates is one of the most damaging features of its record, damaging to its credibility and damaging to the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is relevant, in discussing this matter of public importance, to look at two things: Firstly, a comparison between the situation as at 30 June this year and the situation as at 30 June last year; and, secondly, a comparison between the situation when the Labor Government was in power during 1975 and the situation in mid- 1979, when we have a Liberal-National Country Party coalition Government which has effective control and management of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of what is happening in the rest of the world, it is therefore of fundamental importance that Australia and this Government keep a tight rein on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to keep interest rates down and to keep the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government, and ours is no exception to the rule, can be, or would expect to be, totally satisfied with the socio-economic circumstances that from time to time are to be found in its <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, on top of an investment allowance, is of real importance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country because a capacity to store and reserve grain, fodder and hay is relevant to the carrying capacity of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is ample evidence that this <span class="highlight">economy</span> across a whole range of operation is climbing successfully along the line which is indicated by this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What they will do is to move into the plutonium <span class="highlight">economy</span>, recycling the wastes from power plants to extract the plutonium and building fast breeder plutonium reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will force them into the plutonium <span class="highlight">economy</span> so as to make better use of the limited supplies of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Leader of the Government in the Senate been drawn to articles in today’s Press referring to the economic newsletter distributed by W. D. Scott and Co. which makes certain predictions on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, with particular reference to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ultra nationalistic and so far to the left of anything known as Communism in China or the USSR that it is difficult to find any political appellation to describe the system succinctly, lt comprises total self-sufficiency and self-reliance, total severance from the bourgeois habits of the past, no private ownership, and barter <span class="highlight">economy</span> rather than any dependence on foreign aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of American involvement in Vietnam, the towns of Vietnam, particularly in the south, became swollen with people from the rural areas responding to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that had been created by wartime conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise at this stage to speak in the Budget debate, which has now been proceeding for some weeks, and in the course of which a number of matters concerning the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the impact of the Budget thereon have been raised by honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that for four years we have been told that one of the factors preventing greater stability in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> was the demands of unions in respect of wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years we have seen not only a reduction in the amount of funds provided but also in real terms a lessening of money available to the organisations at a time when development in both the public and private sectors of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is putting more and more pressures upon the protection of the environment in its varied forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it must be said that since this Government has come into office, it has demonstrated its opposition to the expansion of the Australian international shipping industry, for a whole variety of reasons which I do not want to canvass, other than to say that the Australian Labor Party believes that the establishment and maintenance of a secure shipping industry are vital not only for economic reasons and our own domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but also from the point of view of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But now because of the downturn in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of the policies of the present Government there is concern about future employment opportunities in the district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arc not cut-backs in services of this kind a false <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in view of the frequent needs of industry and the community to pick up freight urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition raises this matter of public importance because it believes that a series of events which has recently been given very little publicity and therefore has largely escaped public notice will create the most serious problems for the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the immediate years ahead and may well have dramatic consequences for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had anybody, whether in government or out of government, suggested that by the third quarter of this year these borrowings would pass the $5,000m mark, he would not only have been laughed at but also accused of being a prophet of gloom who was trying to paint a picture of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> heading for collapse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He now finds that the fortunes of Australia, one of the world’s larger trading nations, depend upon our ability to maintain sales of our primary products, minerals and manufacturing exports, and that what happens to the world <span class="highlight">economy</span> has direct and significant impact on our own economic fortunes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To top it all off, the International Monetary Fund has issued a pessimistic statement about the international <span class="highlight">economy</span> for 1 980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the test of whether our management and our <span class="highlight">economy</span> are sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an authoritative article setting out how the world regards this country for now and for the future in its credit rating and in its management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind them that in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  that was framed after the reduced growth prospects overseas had become evident, he noted that the year ahead would be difficult for the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the fundamental reasons why they are better is our sound borrowing programs, which have contributed to the stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the stability of the exchange rate and stability in getting inflation down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the impact of the funds on the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> utterly ignored? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that without the courage and determination of the Fraser Government to right the wrongs in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> there would not have been the achievements that we have seen since 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These trends were fuelled by that fundamental evil- inflation- which the Whitlam Labor Government failed to come to terms with, which was the underlying pressure on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and which has created the difficulties that we are still suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we saw a furious and desperate attempt by the Whitlam Labor Government to recover the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the latter part of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Labor Government at that time was not seeking to redress the fundamental problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in order to stabilise the value of the Australian currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we have a government which has demonstrated its ability to attack the fundamental problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to that is to control the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in particular inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very unsound approach to adopt in trying to assess trends in any situation within any <span class="highlight">economy</span>, or for that matter, business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This stemmed not merely from the subdued state of the world <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but from the domestic economic distortions which developed in the mid- 1 970s and which reduced the competitiveness of Australian industries and Australia’s attractiveness to foreign capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in view of the precarious state of the present <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likelihood that economic fortunes will not improve, we propose to follow the precedent set by the then Opposition parties and we will be seeking more detailed information about aspects of the Government’s economic and fiscal policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has admitted that he made a promise that he would take three years to clean up the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but he admits that he has failed to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of my earlier remarks I referred to certain developments in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over the past 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we certainly will seek from the Government detailed answers to questions on current matters involving the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the deficit operated by the Government and to its effect upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as the air-hose syndrome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was referring earlier to the air-hose syndrome which relates to the deficit incurred by governments in running the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Government is so involved in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and because it does in fact incur a deficit, a difference between income and revenue which has to be raised from the people by way of borrowings, we have a stepping on the air-hose effect, cutting off the supply of funds for the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The air-hose syndrome is one of concern in my State of South Australia because of the activities of the former Labor Government in respect of over-regulation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improving performance of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> overseas, because of increased competitiveness and improved performance in the rural sector, is likely to lead to an inflow of capital from overseas into new resource projects plus, I hope, smaller deficits on the current account of the balance of payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing mismanagement of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the Prime Minister and this Government with policies which have caused a lack of confidence in this nation’s potential and created inflation and unemployment not experienced for 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a multi-mineral resource, of which uranium is only one part, and its development will provide a tremendous boost to the South Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to understand that one of the reasons that the British <span class="highlight">economy</span> appears to have gone into a state of decline is that the British in recent years have not been making their contribution to industrial research and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can see in the failure and the staggering of the British <span class="highlight">economy</span> in that period a direct reflection of the failure of the British to involve themselves in the important task of investing in research and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already mentioned, the fact that this is growing in the United Kingdom and that there are consequent failures on the part of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">economy</span> to adapt ought to be salutory lessons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one looks at his works ‘Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts’, ‘Contributions to the Critique of Political <span class="highlight">Economy</span>’, ‘Anti-Duhring’ and the remarkable work ‘The Poverty of Philosophy’ one will see that there is a substantial intellectual criticism of the use of science and technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the cost of purification is high, I question whether it should be sacrificed on the ground of <span class="highlight">economy</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of its irresponsible mismanagement of the country’s <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the Labor Government created economic circumstances that deprived many of Queensland’s Aborigines of work opportunities and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time this Government has dined out on its self-proclaimed superiority in matters of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and it is delays such as this that expose the speciousness of that line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly they are not inspiring the regeneration of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which was supposed to have been the strategy of this Government when it was elected to office in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ignores the urgent necessity to accelerate road construction and maintenance programs designed to improve the quality of the Australian road system as a vital component of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of transportation in the development of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the way in which it is structured is becoming an increasing problem from the point of view of both the public and private sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To concentrate on the main arterial and national roads, as is the policy of the Government at present and the direction of its funding, is to act to the serious disadvantage of the country and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have an efficient <span class="highlight">economy</span>, if we are to be able to move our goods as we require, if we wish to get our goods to the coastline and have them exported, then our roads, railways and shipping lines must be of the highest efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it ignores the contribution made by Western Australia to the nation’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the vital role of a viable road system in maintaining and improving that contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A much wider range of compensation for damages might need to be contemplated in order to keep the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> of local communities at a viable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the net sector approach is generally regarded as being more useful for studies of how inflationary pressures are transmitted from one sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said here a number of times that the major disputes affecting the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> finally have been resolved by the ACTU and the ACTU  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and in the light of the issues before the Australian people and the union movement, it would be a good thing to adjourn this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would get the appreciation, not only of the Parliament, but also of the people outside concerned about the future of workers, about employment and the role of arbitration in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier- this was told to the Government- the Autralian Council of Trade Unions told the Government that it was not only prepared to talk about this Bill, but prior to the Budget  Mr Hawke  told the Government that it was prepared to discuss anything affecting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and that he would go along to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were arrangements decided on by the founding fathers and which have given to our type of society and <span class="highlight">economy</span> the resolution of disputes by a body outside the control and influence directly of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not argued that the procedural changes are required in order to achieve expedition and <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the trial of issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, with the partial recovery of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we find the situation is that many unionists are trying to initiate wage increases outside the national wage cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government espouses the private enterprise syndrome but if people cannot meet their hire purchase or home payments the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be further compounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it did, does the Government realise the secondary effect when people get behind in home payments in this hire purchase <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make the point in the shortest possible time- for the sake of the Oposition- which was made clear in the middle 1 950s in the Boilermakers case, that the role of the Arbitration Commission in Australian society is of fundamental importance to the future of the society itself; not only to the future of the trade unions, not only to the future of the employers or indeed only to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Looking at it from the point of view of the Liberal philosophy, as these people are put out of work or displaced, they get behind with their hire purchase payments and then the private enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span> goes up the spout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will not improve quickly and the other is that our unemployment rate will continue to increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his statement on energy on 27 June 1979, the Prime Minister announced the introduction of a voluntary program of national fuel <span class="highlight">economy</span> goals for passenger vehicles which, by itself, should result in savings of motor spirit of approximately 12 per cent by 1987. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be easy to demonstate by a comparison of the growth of the United States <span class="highlight">economy</span>, as opposed to the Japanese <span class="highlight">economy</span> since the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government tells people all over Australia that it has the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the rails; that it can handle the finances of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn my mind to these matters because it seems to me that, in looking at the general question of unemployment in this country, the difficulties which the country is facing regarding the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the ability to make sure that people can be employed, it is important that the Government or, in fact, the Minister requires the Council to look into the question of employment generally in respect to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the Prime Minister made that statement- I am recounting what were the expectations; people expected the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to improve- the Minister who then had responsibility for the whole sector of employment and industrial relations,  Mr Street,  said in the House of Representatives on 14 September 1978 that there were no signs of an immediate significant improvement in the employment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that we concluded, and the Opposition has said, that it was necessary in the Government’s interests in some way to relieve  Mr Street  of the responsibility of giving the real position in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to hand over to another Minister,  Mr Viner,  who had had some success in public relations in the Aboriginal field, a new obligation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The real problem is the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition puts forward the argument that departments and statutory authorities should be allowed to take more apprentices and trainees than their present quotas permit, so that a group of skilled workers will be available at a time when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> recovers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that ultimately the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will recover, even by its own actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there are jobs available, nothing can be done to ensure the security and stability of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We would then make great progress in the restoration of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The theory is that if the demand for goods and services is almost equal to the supply of goods and services and a lot more money is thrust into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, there will be too much money chasing too few goods, and prices will go up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there anybody in this place who suggests for one moment that the demand for goods and services in today’s <span class="highlight">economy</span> is equal to the supply of goods and services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We propose the deletion of three exemptions, namely clause 33 relating to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, clause 34 dealing with breach of confidence and clause 36 relating to Crown privilege, the necessary protections they contain being sufficiently covered elsewhere and there being a danger of misuse of these provisions as they are presently drawn; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognised even then that we were starting to move into a post-market <span class="highlight">economy</span> where competition was no longer adequate to keep prices down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most markets were dominated by a few big corporations, many of them foreign, which had pricing policies which were determined overseas and which had a flow-on effect on our national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The PJT was designed to monitor the price changes taking place in that corporate sector of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and not in every small shop or business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The OECD has found this to be a factor that governments have to take into consideration because prices are being manipulated in that area of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this activity is to strengthen the corporate sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to make competition less of an influence over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the longer haul the responsibility obviously is to avoid the emergence of overall excess demand, and to aim by budgetary and credit policies to hold total expenditure within the capacity of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: How was this Government able between, say, 1975 and 1978, to get inflation rates down and stability back into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have looked at the effects of that emasculation on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and we have looked at the action which Labor will take when returned to office to revitalise the PJT to enable it to function effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish the <span class="highlight">economy</span> had been such that the Government could have increased it to two per cent this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are now signs that the Government’s antiinflationary policies are just not working at all and that some other measures must be taken to stimulate the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to restore it to a more healthy position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Originally that surcharge was to end in August of this year but because the Government got itself into such a mess with the <span class="highlight">economy</span> it decided to maintain that surcharge until 1 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am sure that the real truth will hit home to the people of South Australia when their jobs are gone and when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of their State runs down under a government that is not able to manage its affairs, the same as this Federal Government cannot manage the affairs of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find it expressed very considerably in Great Britain where many of the tasks that are performed in the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are performed by those people who have migrated to Great Britain from the West Indies and in the social tensions that are created as a result of seeing them perform the tasks that they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an early step the Government agreed to the establishment of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure on 29 April 1 976 in response to the need for a greater indepth examination of public expenditure in relation to effectiveness and <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the delivery of given Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, he said that on the Sydney to Perth route the increase in air navigation charges for a one-way <span class="highlight">economy</span> fare would be only $2.42, that on the Melbourne to Hobart route it would be 60c and that on the Canberra to Sydney route it would be 33c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if Iran stopped exports completely- and that would have major implications for Iran ‘s <span class="highlight">economy</span>- any direct impact in a quantitative sense would not be felt for some time because, based on IEA information, stocks in Western countries are at an all time high and there are substantial stocks on the water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that any State or Territory which can produce such figures must have an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is running very strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Budget context the meaning of ‘borrowing excessively ‘ depends on the general state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no good a government of the colour that we have today going out and preaching <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the work force if it is quite prepared to spend money as though it is going out of fashion and not account for it in the Parliament when it is asked questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today there has been the usual spate of statements that full employment will return when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> comes good again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inflation rates getting back to higher levels than they have ever been before in this country, interest rates just as high as they ever were before, the manufacturing sector more depressed in three years of the present Government than it was in the previous three years and overseas borrowings which 1 have just mentioned greater than any overseas borrowings program in the history of this country is  Senator Kilgariff  ‘s concept of a balanced <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that we ought to start thinking about the arts as a significant and constructive part of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, because they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present to the Senate some figures that might enable us to discuss the arts as an effective and important part of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we never hear the Government speaking about the arts in this serious and very engaged way in which it talks about areas of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> like agriculture and mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, as I have described, a constructive and productive area of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is accepted that Portugal did not do much to develop the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-116-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us accept tonight for the purposes of this discussion the desirability of having a scheme which involves a statutory authority with a power to acquire compulsorily the produce of individual people, with a responsibility to negotiate in relation to the sale of the total Australian wheat crop, with the responsibility to manage what amounts to something like $2 billion- that is $2,000m- worth of sales which, given the state of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, would have to be regarded as a significant amount of money to be handling, and in a position as a trustee on behalf of growers given a statutory right to acquire, a statutory obligation to sell and a statutory obligation to account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly legislation dealing with the wheat industry is of enormous importance to the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned that I would like to talk briefly about the importance of the sugar <span class="highlight">economy</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result, the industry, Australian consumers and the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> have all reaped tangible benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had the effect of adding to inflationary pressures within the <span class="highlight">economy</span> because many of the goods coming in are inputs into our industrial and commercial life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 11 September 1979  (Hansard,  page 518)  Senator Bishop  asked me a question without notice, concerning offers by the  President  of the ACTU,  Mr Hawke,  to confer with the Government about the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, wages and jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real issue confronting Australia is irresponsible industrial action which has seriously damaged the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Prime Minister received a letter from the Premier of Western Australia concerning the adverse effect the present currency situation is having on the Western Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the light of these indicators, how can the Treasurer possibly claim that the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is well on the way to recovery? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></li>
