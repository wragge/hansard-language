<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The urgent need for the Government, as a matter of public importance, to consider the grave implications of a public call for a mass return to the streets on April 21st, supporting the aggression by Regular North Vietnamese Armed Forces within South Vietnam and calling for an end to the Australian-United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of the discussion of a matter of public impor tance dealing with the Vietnam moratorium movement, the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  who now is not in the House, made the allegation that I, as a member of the Australian Labor Party, now subscribed to a policy which, to quote his words, ‘calls for an end to the Australian-United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a joint Russian-Australian scientific base were established in Australia would it not represent a threat to the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between Australia and the United States and would it be likely to render useless any bases which the United States has in Australia today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr D. G. Pettigrew, Managing Director of the Sun <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Group in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask: Does the Minister regard the ANZUS <span class="highlight">alliance</span> as vital for the future protection of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Foreign Minister concerning the implications and effectiveness of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maintenance of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States under ANZUS remains most important for our security . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the donation by Qantas Airways Ltd of a free trip  from  Fiji to London as first prize in an election fund raising festival queen competition for the Fijian <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does  Mrs Joan  Adamson,  President  of the Women’s Action <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, have to say on this subject? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nigerian National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>) United Progressive Grand <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these Australian Liberals - these little frightened men who proclaim their proprietorial interest in the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> - are prepared to see this war go on and on, have twice sabotaged American initiatives to end it, have resented or resisted any moves to stop it, whatever the cost to America’s real strength and purpose in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matter is that while Australia values the closeness and strength of its friendship and <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States, our forces are in Vietnam to help the government of the South at its request. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission is also of the view that though there may be not any formal military <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Vietnam the establishment of a united Military Assistance Command in South Vietnam as well as the introduction of a large number of United States military personnel beyond the stated strength of the Military Assistance Advisory Group amounts to a factual military <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which is prohibited under Article 19 of the Geneva Agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to think of this is that 6 months after the signing of the Geneva Agreements which prohibited infiltration and which prohibited any military <span class="highlight">alliance</span> the United States, on its own evidence, was in action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that there is some kind of <span class="highlight">alliance</span> or co-operation between the Communist Party and the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historically, British strategy was always to form an eastern <span class="highlight">alliance</span> against a central threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the threat came from Napoleon’s France, <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with powers east of France took place, that is, with Prussia and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the threat came from Imperial Germany the answer was an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with France in the west and Czarist Russia in the east. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a threat from Hitler’s Germany, there was an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Soviet Union on the eastern side of Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always the central expanding threat has been countered by a British <span class="highlight">alliance</span> further to the east. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I would like to see a much closer <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between South Africa and ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They added to their racist doctrine, virulent anti-Semitism and formed an unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with Boerenasie - the Greyshirts an organisation that imitated in style and content the Blackshirts and Brownshirts of Nazi Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no longer possible to depict or defend this war in terms of the freedom of the Vietnamese people or the people of Indo-China, a war for freedom or for democracy, a war against China or a war to maintain the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, or any of the other definitions which have been used to extenuate and extend our commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the working people can and one day they will, in <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with progressive students and other sections of the population, overthrow capitalism, kick out the bosses, seize the wealth that is rightfully theirs and establish Socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that we would be deserting our allies, that we would be breaking our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States of America, if we accepted the National Liberal Front as a party to any negotiations to bring about a peaceful solution to the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1939 Hitler and Stalin were in <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">alliance</span> was changed only when Hitler turned on his faithful friend, Stalin, in June 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, with military education developing so rapidly and moving into closer <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with conventional academic scholarship, bastardisation cannot be tolerated; all vestiges of it must be eradicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this close <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, 1 shall deal with the reason for the extension ofboth Acts in this speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, if such an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> can emerge will the Prime Minister pledge increased economic and material aid from Australia to enable these nations who already have the manpower but lack the sinews of war to defend their freedom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communists wish to destroy our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States and to end the trust iri which we are held in South East Asia - the trust and respect which South Vietnam has for us; the trust and respect which Malaya, Singapore and South Korea have for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most important, it would draw the attention of the world to the fact that Australia, by its own choice, alone in a lonely part of the world, had thrown away its alliances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is there another powerful ally in the world to whom we could turn if we threw away the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That makes an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of trust, confidence and moral strength which only true friends know and feel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I wish to refer now to a rather strange <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which J have formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The American <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, crucial as it is, has not been, under the Liberals, part of an Australian foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, it means that our policies and attitudes must be free of any racist taint in alliances, sports and passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is futile to think that the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> can effectively endure if we affront the world’s most powerful negro community, with the world’s largest negro army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might comment there that the attitude of the Indonesian Government towards alliances and bases is in striking contrast to our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We simply cannot imagine a world in which there is no American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, in which there are no American ships, aeroplanes or bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indonesia has got along without such alliances for years and that nation is expressing no hysteria at the thought of Western powers leaving this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he in one breath now advocating a closer <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with Indonesia and  two  breaths later implying criticism of her? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has made it clear that it does not want to join any military pact or <span class="highlight">alliance</span> but wishes to pursue a policy of neutrality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>America has in Europe the NATO <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas I said that Malaysia and Singapore and other nations may well be revising their outlook and their treaties and where they will place their confidence, I did not have time to say, but I say now, that I would not blame these countries for changing their outlook because they know that should there be a change of government in Australia the alliances and treaties would be worth nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the speeches of members of the Opposition have had their effect on those with whom we would wish to have friendship and <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their removal would have no substantial effect upon the work of the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the evidence is that the Western <span class="highlight">alliance</span> or call it what you will - our association with the Americans in this matter and the New Zealanders - is withdrawing from the field in Vietnam yet in this crucial moment Australia is prepared to dispatch another 30 or 40 young men to their death and perhaps somewhere between 100 and 120 who will be seriously wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An exceptionally vicious and tragic war is being fought in Cambodia with a rather uneasy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Cambodian Army and units of the South Vietnamese Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would destroy Australia’s reputation as a reliable ally and, as the extreme left of the Australian Labor Party - but not the  Deputy  Leader of the Party - wants, it would also destroy every defence and treaty <span class="highlight">alliance</span> that Australia has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows full well that we are there because we drifted into it with some dream about the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No member on this side of the House can be confident that our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States of America - an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of utmost significance - would be secure in the hands of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is to mean anything it bestows both rights and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1965 the people were inclined to accept that our commitment was justified, not to say required, by the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sold its case on the basis that America would be strengthened in our region and that our commitment would strengthen the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a kind of unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with Russia and China, we have provided the 2 Vietnams with almost limitless capacity for mutual self-destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a strange <span class="highlight">alliance</span> indeed to find the suburban lobby triumphant with the aid of honourable members drawn from a countryside in trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and Mutual Assistance, concluded in Moscow in 1950, is virtually a military <span class="highlight">alliance</span> aimed against Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Presumably he was also concerned with the Labor Party, but personally he clearly did not want to be tied to an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has also denigrated the Australia-United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If no United States President can ever again send troops abroad, that immediately destroys every defensive <span class="highlight">alliance</span> that the United States has around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We cannot look to 1942 and the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and all the things that the Americans were supposed to have saved us from then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> has been one of the continuing themes in attempting to prejudice the self reliance of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am for alliances but I have no faith in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> has been one of the sacred cows of Australian politics for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 15 years I have sat here and heard it - the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, to be saved from the surges from the north, cringing down in the south east corner of the continent, waiting for someone to save us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We committed troops for a number of reasons, among them being, it should be recalled, to maintain our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and treaty obligations, because it was a strategically vital area, and also to permit the South Vietnamese to choose their own form of government and not to have terror and coercion imposed upon them from North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which will not stop change but rather it will seek to delay or control change by ensuring that such change is by negotiation rather than by violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of this close <span class="highlight">alliance</span> I shall deal with the reason for the extension of both Acts in this speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to Japan, the future of her <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with America is now to some extent in doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Australian people will continue to repudiate the Labor Party as long as its members make speeches like the one the honourable member for Sturt has just made, which was nothing more than a sell out of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this question of the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> he brought out the old furphy that we cannot look after ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> would not necessarily be of use to us when the chips are down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as yet we are not able to stand on our own 2 feet and that if we have an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> we must stand by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, under, I believe, Chapter 21 of the Platform and Constitution of the Labor Party the Labor Party took out that part of the old platform that said that the ANZUS Treaty is of crucial importance to the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between Australia and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to sustain the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Acting Prime Minister suggested that I was linked with some assumed move to make the Australian-United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> inoperable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government talks invariably in terms of the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has aimed to tell the Australian people that ANZUS and the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> still mean something, and undoubtedly when he returns he will again tell the people of Australia, as he has told them for the last 20 years, that the ANZUS relationship is as strong, as valid and as vital as ever and that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it might be said that that is part of the normal price that may be paid for an <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, but I do not believe that Australia’s objectives will always be the same as those of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An end to the principle that the US <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is crucial, and a beginning of support for the “human rights’ revolution around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Labor Party no longer regards the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> or the ANZUS Treaty as crucial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had this same grovelling attitude on his part as though Americans are the only people who populate the earth and if we in Australia do not bow to every whim and wish and if we do not abdicate in favour of the United States all of our national responsibilities which the people elected us to perform, we must be considered to be traitors with respect to the grand and great <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this compromise the Labor Party deleted references to ‘the crucial importance5 of the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and substituted the following: That the Australian Labor Party ‘seeks close and continuing co-operation with the United States and New Zealand to make the ANZUS Treaty an instrument for justice and peace, social and economic advancement in the Pacific’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the changes in policy this would bring are:  (1)  An end to the principle that the US <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is crucial, and  a  beginning of support for the ‘human rights’ revolution around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a great guarantee of <span class="highlight">alliance</span> in defence are the President’s words, yet it is the sort of guarantee which the Australian Labor Party seeks to wave airily aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The military advisers of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation said in a communique that the Russian presence in the Indian Ocean was causing the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> considerable anxiety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A prominent member of the Labor Par’y front bench has recommended that we should withdraw from all military alliances, including the ANZUS <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, and retreat into isolationism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister ask the United States  President  for any guarantees that the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> would cover Australia in the event of our being involved in a conflict in the Malaysia-Singapore area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no mention, we noticed, of the SEATO <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be one of the first times in history that an Australian Prime Minister has not received some sort of consolatory reassurances that this <span class="highlight">alliance</span> actually means something to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that this <span class="highlight">alliance</span> does not mean anything to the United States and does not mean anything to the people of the region, let alone to those nations which are members of the SEATO <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which is nominally aimed at protecting democracy and freedom in South East Asia yet virtually its only Asian supporter, Thailand, now has a government which has conducted a coup d’etat which has destroyed democracy in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders now, if this SEATO <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is aimed at protecting Thailand, what exactly is it aimed at protecting, apart from the financial and political interests of that minority who have seized power formally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of the United States and New Zealand is essential and must continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the ANZUS Treaty is a defensive treaty, a defensive <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which is important to us and to the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the Labor Party would unilaterally and without consultation withdraw from this <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and destroy what has been built up and developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Allan Fraser)  has implied that on occasions such as this sometimes unholy alliances arise between members of the differing political persuasions, and I find myself on this occasion in such an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with him and the honourable member for Mallee  (Mr Turnbull). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope,  Sir, that  that explains the reason why I find myself in good company in this unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the honourable member for EdenMonaro and the honourable member for Mallee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>equally stable defensive <span class="highlight">alliance</span> to supplant it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Education and Science has recognised the difficulty in defining efficiency but the Bill’s very use of the term and its definition within the Bill as an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of qualifications, aptitude, merit, diligence and good conduct raises the whole question of what education’ is as a professional activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this policy there is no provocation unless our very <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States is held to be such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To help to prevent a nuclear war is, we believe, consistent with our first and highest national interests, with our alliances - including our obligations under those alliances - and with our international obligations generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newspaper reports also stated that amongst the aims of the organisation calling the demonstration was the ending of the United States-Australia <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newspaper report makes it quite clear that the honourable member and his supporters do not seek but demand* - I use the word advisedly because it appears in the report - the end of the United States-Australian <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This brings the question of the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and the future of such agreements to ANZUS right out into the open. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been known for many years that the forces of the Left within the ALP have sought to downgrade and destroy an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to newspaper reports of the time it was only after the Leader of the Opposition had said that it would put an intolerable ‘ burden on the Party’s electoral prospects to Completely discard the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> that a compromise was reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know, the Conference deleted reference to the crucial importance of the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and substituted a form of words which were to emasculate the ANZUS Treaty and make it a vague convention on human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had frequent protestations both within and outside this House by the Leader of the Opposition endeavouring to support the view that the ALP has not changed its attitude towards the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> but, in fact, has ‘ strengthened it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been given the lie by an unequivocal demand for the end of the US-Australian <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some will believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with America should end; others may not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s call makes ‘ a mockery of the Australian Labor Party’s attempt to convince the people that the United StatesAustralian <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is still important to that Party and to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we propose that the House should ask the Government to consider the grave implications of the call for a mass return to the streets supporting the aggression by Regular North Vietnamese armed forces within South Vietnam and calling for an end to the United States-Australian <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aims of the Moratorium were to oppose US and allied aggression in Indo-China, to demand the end of the US-Australia <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, to end conscription, and to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all US and allied troops and material from Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They knew that Britain had been withdrawing from Malaysia and that the United States was withdrawing from South East Asia and so they wanted to create a new <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask how the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  can equate the Labor Party’s statement of support for ANZUS with the call by one of his own shadow Ministers for an end to the United States-Australian <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>SEATO may be scuttled if necessary but first let us have an equally stable defence <span class="highlight">alliance</span> to supplant it.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we hear from the Opposition is that SEATO, ANZUS and the 5-power arrangements are not highly thought of by people in Malaysia-Singapore, and that Indonesia is not a party to these alliances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no use to say that we should scrap our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with America and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not time to expand upon this, but it is quite clear that the ALP does not regard ANZUS as a military <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> does involve obligations, and we have been beside the Americans in Korea and in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the price we have to pay, but is there anybody here so stupid as to think that if you enter into an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and you expect to receive benefits from it, you do not have to pay some price? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those sections of the Australian Labor Party are not only supporting this aggression; there was also a report that the honourable member for Lalor was calling for an end to the Australian-American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have seen no public repudiation by the Australian Labor Party of the honourable member for Lalor for calling for support for North Vietnam, for an end to the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the dominant left wing of the Labor Party clearly wants is a communist victory in South East Asia, and it wants to destroy the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor has said that he wants to see the end of Australia’s <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a great guarantee of <span class="highlight">alliance</span> in defence are the President’s words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, last year the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party threw out of its platform a clause saying that the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is essential and must continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party is also the Party which has consistently sought to denigrate the SEATO <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not content with these attempts to scuttle Australia’s alliances, the Labor Party has thrown alarm into our colleague governments in Malaysia and Singapore by its attitude to what is known as the 5-power defence arrangements for that area, to which this Government subscribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is the same tactic and technique - divide and conquer; break South Vietnam away from the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>; move away one edge of the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and isolate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What credibility can Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, or Malaysia, or New Zealand or any of those countries with which we have alliances - the United States of America, if you like - place on Australia’s future defence policy when all the time the alternative government of Australia - perhaps only a powerful section of it, or the whole of it - is prepared to repudiate our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States, to attack the United States and to give succour to the Communist forces in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the end decision which the Australian people have to make in respect of themselves, their children and the future of Australia is: Can they place reliance on and trust in the Labor Party when it talks about defence alliances and Communism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of the rather strange policy which the US has pursued towards India - a rather clumsy policy, I believe, because it did not have to treat India almost as an enemy - has been to conciliate Pakistan because of the significance of the Pakistan <span class="highlight">alliance</span> to the US in the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have recently heard statements by the honourable member for Lalor on television in respect to the breaking of the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and in support of the North Vietnamese and for the Communist cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objectives of the moratorium are to oppose the United States and allied aggression in Indo-China; to oppose United States domination of Australia and to demand an end to the United States-Australia <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is exactly what the honourable member for Lalor seems to be trying to do, advertently or inadvertently - to break the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am beginning to doubt whether it is worth saying anything in this Parliament, but I think it is time that the Australian people as a whole began to face the situation which is arising in this country, where it is wrong - and it is admitted by the Opposition that it considers it is wrong - to work or talk or converse with anybody who is in favour of working against communism in this country, although it is perfectly okay for members of the Labor Party, at moratoriums or demonstrations about matters concerned with Vietnam or with the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, to associate with communists and to march in the street under communist flags. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard some df his colleagues say that the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and the ANZUS treaty should be scrapped and/or that the treaty is useless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet the United States Secretary of State reported in his policy statement that the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America- that is the ANZUS treaty, 20 years old on 1st September 1971 - is as vital to the 3 partners in the changing circumstances of the 1970s as it was during the cold war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tn the Australian Labor Party’s 1969 ‘Platform Constitution and Rules’ there was a reference to the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> as being crucial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is crucial’ was the overriding statement in Labor’s foreign policy whatever may be said from time to time by individuals or conference,’ the Federal Labor Leader asserted in Perth yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F.

    <p>An end to the principle that the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is crucial- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that the right honourable gentleman and his Government reject the views of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Royal Australian Planning Institute and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, which have formed a national <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and in a manifesto a month ago declared that the very real problems of unplanned urban growth are now approaching a crisis situation in many areas and are in large part caused by the failure to develop national and State policies to co-ordinate this growth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now it is not a defence <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, but simply a kind of economic partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a great difference between the Labor Party’s attitude and our attitude to the ANZUS <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which, in the last resort, we regard as the sheet anchor of our defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He came here twice as  President,  as the Prime Minister has said, and by those actions he set the seal on his friendship for Australia and his determination to maintain the closeness of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion was part of a general strategy of the left wing of the ALP to get a neutralist non-aligned Australian policy in expectation of the Federal Conference rejecting the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and other overseas commitments by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can, for instance, decide whether or not; as is proposed, there is to be an end to the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and it can end our uncertainty by victory for one side on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hartley  went on television to say that the Labor Party was determined that Australia would disentangle itself from the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F.

    <p>This <span class="highlight">alliance</span> was established under a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Opposition trying to destroy the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> from which it has extracted so much political advantage over the years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely this is not the meaning of an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we have put ourselves into the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and, as a result, it has cost us very dearly in our involvement in the quagmire of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we could not have done this in these circumstances, much as we wanted to retain our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In just 3 months we have witnessed a retreat towards isolationism, an attempt by a section of the Labor Party to destroy the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, and the intensification of a campaign to terminate the Five Power Defence Arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much of our policy is subsequently adopted by the Country Party that I have often wondered in the past why the Country Party did not seek an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Labor Party years ago rather than form their coalition with the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the allegations or the suggestions in  Mr Craig’s  letter are correct, that is, that the WWF and the Australian Council of Trade Unions also have supported the actions that have been taken by  Mr Craig  as the Executive Director of the AEWL and by that Association, it is a strange <span class="highlight">alliance</span> indeed when we find the main sections of the trade union movement involved denying any responsibility for the smaller numbers of branch members in decentralised ports and when we find the Minister for Labour apparently unwilling or unable to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know, from my experience on joint committees that sometimes a difference of opinion has not been between members of opposing parties; there has been an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of members of opposing parties relating to the matters which have been under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people who voted against the Labor Party at elections have done so because of fears that have been built up about the Labor Party, the fear that allegedly it would destroy the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, sell out Australia to Peking and Moscow, and destroy all morality in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The maintenance of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States under ANZUS remains most important for our security, since by its very nature it has created and guarantees in the Pacific a zone of peace in which the peoples of the region have for the last 20 years been free to pursue their political, economic and social goals without fear of hostile intervention or attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the peculiar <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the honourable member for Farrer and the South Australian Premier, let me repeat what I said in answer to a question from the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than any foreign aid program, more than any international obligation which we meet or forfeit, more than any part we may play in any treaty or agreement or <span class="highlight">alliance</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>while Australia values the closeness and strength of its friendship and <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He speaks of the greater necessity today than ever before to maintain out <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States, and yet the Minister for Defence, this man, suggests that there is no forward defence threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote a few of them: ‘ “New search for oil virtually ended” says <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> head’; ‘ “Government hurting us” says Western Mining head’; ‘ “Lack of policy causing difficulties” says EZ chairman’; ‘Attack by Abrolhos on Government oil, gas policies’; ‘Search for minerals at its lowest point for years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will campaign - I say this for the benefit of the people and to assist the Country Party - in the Senate election in May under the name of Country Party, except in Queensland where it will run a joint ticket with the Australian Democratic Labor Party under the name of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I ask the city dwellers to make sure that they vote for the National Party, and the country dwellers to make sure that they vote for the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> because it is important that confusion does not force them to make what might be termed informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in respect of the 1974 Senate election, on 10 March the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party announced that they would be running a joint ticket under the name of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the people should be aware that when they vote for the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> they vote for 2 parties and, in effect they have struck the jackpot - 2 votes for one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In Western Australia on Wednesday, 13 March, the leaders of the Country Party and the DLP will launch a joint campaign for the Western Australian State election under the name of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope people understand that lucid explanation of the arrangements and I think, in order to avoid confusion amongst honourable members also, it would be only fair if the Leader of the Country Party would say whether he represents in this House the Country Party, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, the Nationals or the National Party because I would not like to use the wrong title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a gorgeous <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with people like the Premier of Queensland who sits in judgment on others, calls his State a sovereign State - nobody has yet explained to me what that expression means - and holds sway on something less than 19 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of alliances always arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know alliances with whom and for what. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But instead of talking about alliances between governments we ought to be talking about alliances between people and an understanding by people of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between governments is no <span class="highlight">alliance</span> at all unless there is an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment there is no <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Australian people and the American people because nothing is done to promote it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But certainly there are alliances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My visit to Australia impresses me with the vitality of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not sure whether I am correct in referring to him by that title, or whether it should be the Leader of the <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party or the National Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the Leader of the Country Party or the <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party or the National Country Party, whatever one chooses to call it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a national standpoint, or, indeed, from any rational economic viewpoint at all, it is glaringly evident that there is no reason hurriedly to accept the oil companies’ case for a major rise in crude prices or for that matter  Mr Anthony’s  <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with them on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this new Country Party manifesto on oil prices a warning to primary producers of the divided interests which are to be served by the <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party, National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, Country Party or whatever you like to call it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great pity is that the people who purport to be representing country electorates and who for the time being go under the name of the Australian Country Party, which is soon to be called the <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party or the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party, have not so far shown the same deep concern for country people that has been shown repeatedly by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Liberal State Government would join in a 4-State <span class="highlight">alliance</span> against the Labor Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This applies equally to the 3 anti-Labor State governments with whom  Sir Charles  Court is so keen to establish a four-State <span class="highlight">alliance</span> as well as to the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under proposed amendments to the Electoral Act which will enable listing of registered party names on ballot papers will the newly formed National Liberal Party be able to use this name because of its similarity in meaning to the Liberal Party of Australia, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and the proposed National Country Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation is already complicated by the announced change of name of the Country Party, which lists itself under a variety of noms de plume such as the ‘National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>’, the ‘National Party of Australia’ and the ‘National Country Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In quite a non-political way, to assist honourable members opposite in their hour of need and to avoid the confusion that exists between the trendy and the non-trendy Liberals, the Country Party <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and the National Country Party, I suggest that the best way to make a formal vote in any following election is to vote No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The member of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party who has just interjected is in a Party that has been decimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But roughly speaking, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party received 10 per cent of the vote in Western Australia, the Australian Labor Party received 48.5 per cent of the vote and the Liberal Party received 41 per cent or thereabouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 48.8 per cent of the vote in the State election in Western Australia is a sign of no confidence in Labor, may I ask what 10 per cent of the vote for the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> is? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> received a line up of very small seats with its 10 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and working defence relationship with the United States continue important of course - in terms of the global balance, of our regional standing, of the long-term contingency of serious deterioration in our strategic situation, and of defence force in several important practical respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was in the United States early last January, I was able to re-affirm publicly in New York and privately in Washington, to the Secretaries of State and Defence, Drs Kissinger and Schlesinger, and to other senior members of the United States Administration and the United States Armed Services, the importance I and my colleagues in the Government continued to attach to Australia’s <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and practical working defence relationship with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly perhaps than anything else, Australian firms or Australian based firms that have gone overseas rather than put up with the Minister’s policies- which have been aptly described by some of my colleagues as the policies of a banana republic- because they reckon that when they go overseas they are dealing with governments with which they can deal, which is not the case with this mob, include the Australian OU and Gas, Australian Associated Resources, <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, Beach, South Pacific, Endeavour, Broken Hill Pty, Magellan Hartogen and Target companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the security of Australia has never rested solely upon the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, that <span class="highlight">alliance</span> remains a key element in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The South Vietnamese Government was not anxious to have other military forces operating in South Vietnam but the United States, for its own purposes, wanted to have a broadening of the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> so that the United States  President  could tell his own people that there was a wide support for United States policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What an extraordinary <span class="highlight">alliance</span> against the interests of the farmer, the man on the land- the first and the greatest victim of national calamity! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable member with the greatest respect that it would be asking too much of a Senate, an Upper House divided as it is at certain times in a nation’s history and often under the control- if I may say this- of an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of influences with Opposition and independent senators holding views which are not reflected in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike other agreements it is not possible for any nation to get specific performance of an <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, of a treaty arrangement of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a fine way to continue building up that reservoir of goodwill that the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  so aptly referred to when discussing what was necessary for an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> to be properly effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reality is that those who follow the foreign policies espoused by the honourable member for Lalor are those who wish to see the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the United States of America and Australia torn asunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The value of any <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is ultimately dependent on the reservoir of goodwill that exists between the member states to that <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The insults, the denigration, the constant calling into question of the value of that <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, must have jeopardised that reservoir of goodwill to a substantial extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Barnard,  the then Minister for Defence, and the United States Secretary of Defence,  Mr Schlesinger,  saw the status of the station as a bilateral arrangement in the framework of the ANZUS Treatywords that must have been written for  Mr Barnard  by members of the Opposition Partiesfundamental to the ANZUS <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, fundamental to the ANZUS Treaty and a part of the bilateral arrangement between 2 countries which share a common approach to the world’s problems today as stronger members of the Western industrialised democracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It rests on the ANZUS <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, as has been recognised by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in January 1973 he said that Labor had a mandate and a duty to maintain the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government alleges that it believes in an American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>- it says it does but it does little to prove it- and if it then opposes the expansion of a logistic support base at Diego Garcia, it is, in racing parlance, trying to ride 2 horses in different directions at the one time, and it cannot be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area where we can play an important role but all we will hear for the next 20 years is whether we are to be loyal to the United States <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and whether we are to rely on ANZUS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that in any <span class="highlight">alliance</span> we have to boast or act as though we are going through some boy scout ceremony of crediting our allegiance by lying flat on the floor and saying: ‘We are your ally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was this unhealthy nature of the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> during the period of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government that affected the very real and basic relationship that exists between the people of the United States of America and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that address- I am paraphrasing it- he made it clear that one of the great problems in the United States in terms of trade was that an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> could be found between what he called American capitalists and leaders of Russia which acts to the disadvantage of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The NATO headquarters was in France, and it finally came to the point where de Gaulle needed to ask a straight question: ‘If, because of the presence of these headquarters, or because of the position of France in the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, the Soviet Union were to land a few nuclear missiles on France, would the United States retaliate on her behalf?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular sources of concern with the proposals, which I am advised did become law on 14 February of this year are, firstly, the description of Poland as a ‘socialist state’; secondly, a reference to the Polish United Workers Partythat is, of course, the Communist Party- as the leading political force in the country; thirdly, a reference to Poland’s <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Soviet Union; and, fourthly, a clause that would have made citizens’ rights contingent upon their fulfilling duties towards the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The vital character of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States and with ANZUS requires this action to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable member with the greatest respect that it would be asking too much of a Senate, an upper House divided as it is in certain times of a nation’s history and often under the control- if I may say this- of an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of influences with Opposition and Independent senators holding views which are not reflected in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the day this Government aborted our already conservative constitutional conventions so as to steal office, there has been no doubt that the Liberal-National Country Party <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is one of political reactionaries; that the FraserAnthonyLynch triumvirate is the political wing of the capitalist class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason I raise this matter is that the Government has given great emphasis to its contention that the whole defence of this country is dependent upon the ANZUS Treaty, the ANZUS <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, western Europe is one of 2 pillars of the Atlantic <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and its performance in that respect is important, not only in itself but in its effect on the performance of its partner, the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise as strongly as I can that if we are taking this role for the future- I am in no way disagreeing with it- it is tremendously important that the Government establish, through a market force system or some other system, a mechanism which will prevent an unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the employer and the employee on the waterfront which will be to the detriment of all Australians, particularly those who live by exports or imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then he has no doubt resumed dreaming of trips overseas, particularly at Christmas time, to Jamaica, Montego Bay, New Delhi and Washington- anywhere he can think of where he will no doubt restore the resolve of the Western <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, establish the new international economic order and get India to join the nuclear free zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly cracks are appearing in the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can join in any sort of military <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that it could control the outcome of the election it established a purely bogus political party, the Democratic Turnhalle <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously what happened then was that the newspapers were used to disseminate heavily prejudiced propaganda in support of the Democratic Turnhalle <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, which of course, I ought to mention, although it is unnecessary, was exclusively pro-South African Government in its outlook- a political party which was fabricated around conservative white and conservative black interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it sought in 1976 to dramatise the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States, an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which Labor had sought to improve and place on an equal basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their concept of an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> was very much to regenerate, as I said earlier, the Dulles and Menzies eras- the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Prime Minister and Foreign Minister could not sustain that relationship for its own virtue and instead proposed that we enter into another <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, a treaty, between China, Japan and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we are seeing a pronounced deterioration in the relative strength of the United States and its allies visavis the Soviet Union and its allies, a pronounced deterioration in the capacity of the Western <span class="highlight">alliance</span> to present a united face, and a deterioration in the capacity of the Third World to feel that in the West it has a group of states which are reliable, can be depended upon to make decisions and have the courage to carry them out for the welfare of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a few speeches about the South East Asia Treaty Organisation <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian-American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is as important to Australia as it has ever been.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, if one reads the speeches one will find an extraordinary bewilderment about the Government’s foreign alliances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we have the honourable member for Kennedy arguing an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Government and what he called  atheistic communists ‘ of the Chinese brand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the American strategy in respect of Asia and the West Pacific rests upon an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between three powers- the United States, Japan and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the analyses made by Brzezinski- I choose his because he is one of the immense talents behind  President  Carter- he stated that the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> depended on the three powers to which I referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, one can understand that China will be, and obviously is, concerned when it sees that in the communist world the Vietnamese are operating in an increasingly closer <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with, and with an increasing dependence upon, the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told Women’s Action <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> at weekend that the economic value of domestic work should be assessed and recognised in the National Accounts when we are calculating GDP and that housewives should be counted when determining workforce numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means, firstly, the possession by a foreign power or <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, hostile towards us, of maritime strength sufficient to overcome our own and gain substantial mastery of the seas around us, and the air space over them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Your article entitled ‘soldier in tears calls Vietnamese to battle’ (Sydney Morning Herald, 30 April 1979) presents a dangerously distorted view of the Greater Overseas <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> for the National Restoration of Vietnam and its NSW Chairman Vo Dai Ton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in some contrast to your article of 1 May 1 978 in which you showed the links between the Greater Overseas <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and extreme right-wing Australian groups that seek to create instability in the society here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members and supporters of the <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> who wore headbands inscribed with the words ‘national shame’ apparently do not consider their support of the Thieu regime and its atrocities to be shameful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would adopt this language with respect to the bases in question: ‘This Government will not yield to pressure to break the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, withdraw from the ANZUS treaty or divulge secrets about American defence bases in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would restore Australia’s sovereignty over the bases, would give Australia greater independence, make it a more equal partner in the activities and improve the health of the Australian/American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government shrouds things in secrecy, if it casts them in the mould of something that is privileged to itself then it is weakening the maturity of the Australian nation and weakening the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is no way to run our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That did not help the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was based on an economic <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with conservative, if not reactionary, and repressive East and South East Asian governments and was formed for the purpose of moving more and more American and Japanese industry into new locations in the capital of the East and South East Asian region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This shift of direction of investment, necessary for Japan because of the very success of her economy, has begun to have serious effects for the United States, where there is a steady loss of jobs not so much because of innovative technology but because, of the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between American and Japanese capital and technical know-how, and cheap labour assisted by generous programs of support to encourage export oriented industries, very often designed to penetrate the American, European and Australian markets, where higher profits might be earned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One unanswered question concerning the education work <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is whether the right balance is being struck in the training received by apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To protect the people against an Executive bureaucratic <span class="highlight">alliance</span> we would first of all strengthen the role of the Leader of the Opposition by ensuring full and regular briefings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
