  <li>
    <p>As this building is Commonwealth property and as a spokesman for a group known as the Revolutionary Socialist Students <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> claimed that files had been stolen and that the students may take over the building again next week, will the Minister invoke any necessary laws to protect Commonwealth property and to prevent further incidents such as this which are so alien to the Australian way of life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, does this indicate that the Government is working against the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and has been seriously embarrassed by  President  Nixon’s failure to take the Australian Prime Minister into his confidence on such a vital matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, when can I expect an answer to my question of 18th August and 15th September concerning the alleged activities of  Mr Jon  (Darce) Cassidy, a special projects officer with the ABC, with the WorkerStudent <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls he also aware that a sympathetic high school strike conducted in South Australia had the support of the Young Labor Association and the Socialist Left Youth <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> as well as of the Communist Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose I must also include the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>- the unity ticket between the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ex-Leader of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> would do better to address this question to the Minister for Agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to people standing for elections who purport to represent a particular Party and who, upon being elected, repudiate that Party and claim to represent some other Party, as National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> candidates in Western Australia have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was an organisation formed in Sydney last Sunday, by about 200 members of Sydney’s Vietnamese community, known as the New South Wales Chapter of the Greater Overseas <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> for National Restoration of Vietnam which has as its aim the ultimate overthrow of the Government of Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the statement by the honourable senator, who is no mere Leader of the Opposition in the Senate but the Australian Labor Party shadow Foreign Minister, seriously weaken the defence of Australia and the whole of the Western <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, because when stripped of all its humbug the statement has the sole purpose of creating an intolerable situation for the United States of America and Australia so that the United States will withdraw from its bases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when he was a Minister serving under a disastrous Prime Minister he knew that to give this information would be damaging to Australia and to our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our participation in the war and our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with America have involved Australia as a partner to a country responsible for the brutality and massacres committed at My Lai, even though very few Australians condone such heinous atrocities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>refer those honourable senators who have not yet read the pronouncements that have been made by the White House - this preceded what is now referred to as the Nixon doctrine - to an article which appeared on page 6 of the Melbourne Sun’ on Monday, 24th February 1969 under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Alliance</span> to fill Asian Power Gap?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High US officials want a South Bast Asian <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> of non-Communist countries formed to safeguard the area’s security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">alliance</span> would receive military equipment and advice from the US and other foreign nations - but no troops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The US, once Vietnam is settled, would like to revise or get rid of the Seato <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, preferably the latter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been brought about by the unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> that we have seen in the Senate tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we sometimes hear from honourable senators opposite that we should go all the way with LBJ and how we ought to imitate the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, one of the things I do wish they would try to imitate from the United States is the constitutional guarantees to people’s freedom of action and the refusal to smear people which is engaged in by people like  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Rae. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> would be seriously damaged and a defeat would, in the words of President Nixon, “result in a collapse of confidence in American leadership nol only in Asia but throughout the world”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  President  Johnson’s declaration was debated here in the Senate I made the observation - I have continued to repeat this observation - that, as the United States is our ally and we are involved in responsive obligations to the United States and as it can ask for the return obligations from Australia, it was perfectly safe - indeed, it was proper and strategically in terms of grand strategy it was of paramount importance - that we should advance in a forward disposition into the South East Asian area because at that time we were protected in our advance positions by an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United Kingdom and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third axiom is that whether we like it or not - I consider this to be highly important - Australia has no real grand strategical capacity except in an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with a friendly power which can provide Australia with a strategical capacity to allow Australia to manoeuvre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is more reliant upon its <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to her purpose in South Vietnam and the cause to which she has committed herself there - the defence of a small nation against violent aggression - I would have thought that the gratitude for assistance in the past would earn respect for the present <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and that, so far from disparaging the cause of the United States, no responsible person in the Commonwealth Parliament would denigrate her cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there are many people listening to him who were not born at that time and whom he might mislead, but the fact is that the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of the United States was welcomed as the saviour of the British Isles, and the United States was welcomed as a decisive ally of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will not be defeated because the whole of the Labor Party will support it and at least half of the members of the Government parties will support it as well, so there is an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which will ensure that the Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J always thought that the main reason why we were in Vietnam was because of the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and said that I would like to feel that when the chips were down we had an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of some sort between the nuclear powers - Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He goes on to say that even if every nonCommunist faction were mobilised the resulting <span class="highlight">alliance</span> would prove no better than an equal match for the Vietcong alone and would be vastly overbalanced by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, this Government is responsible for any retrogression in Australia because of the United Kingdom-EEC <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this close <span class="highlight">alliance</span>,I shall deal with the reason for the extension of both Acts in this speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But this unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the DLP and the Government has worked to the detriment of this country for the last 10 years to my knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Protestant <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Friendly Society of Australasia, Grand Council of New South Wales, Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask the Minister whether he has seen reports of an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Australian Labor Party and trade unions to prevent the proposed tour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been tremendous changes, one  of  which is the’ collapse  of  the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between Russia and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that as a result of the visit of this delegation and our participation in the deliberations, the association or <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between Australia and the European countries wiil.be even closer and stronger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 6th July 1948 representatives of the United States Department of State, the Ambassador of Canada and representatives of the Brussels Treaty countries met in Washington to plan such an <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the Vandenberg resolution,  President  Truman was advocating a North Atlantic Treaty <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Vandenberg resolution of 11th June 1949 and the meeting in April 1949, there was the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> which, in April 1949. formed the North Atlantic Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>News as sad as’ we get NASA, which is the North Atlantic Security <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> - advocated by America in that period to which I referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here was a traitor against the plan to create the North Atlantic Security <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, which <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> was to stop the thought about Russian expansion at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there is some disagreement, I submit that the code is clearly a message of a traitor of the North Atlantic Security <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and the letters at the end could well mean that nerve gas had killed a national security treaty traitor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second argument, which is probably more honest but at the same time much more contemptible and undesirable, was that we were part of some great American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, whose nature is usually unspecified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must confess that when I have been in the United States I have not heard an American talk about the Australian <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, we were continually told about the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Maxwell Newton publication ‘Melbourne Observer’ of 12th September which alleges, firstly, that one of the main speakers at a Workers Student <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> conference held at the University of Melbourne on the previous weekend was  Mr Jon  ‘Darce’ Cassidy, special projects officer in the Australian Broadcasting Commission; secondly, that 120 delegates to the Workers Student <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> conference- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Europe there is the NATO <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and behind it is the United States nuclear shield. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Howard is attempting to judge Australia, 1 repeat, according to the European situation where a series of closely-knit alliances is ultimately guaranteed by the nuclear deterrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 speak of American policy because probably the major part of the propaganda for Australia’s involvement in Vietnam - in Indo-China - was because of our American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, whatever that is or may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so does this indicate that the Government is working against the United States of America <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and has been seriously embarrassed by  President  Nixon’s failure to take the Prime Minister into his confidence on such a vital matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries are almost  completely dependent for their arms and the maintenance of their government upon American aid through the mis-named <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> for Progress, lt is rather interesting to find that the threat of Communist China is felt so clearly in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Paraguay and Bolivia - where a new crowd of colonels has just taken over - but not felt in Singapore, Malaysia and Nepal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a Europe that fails to put forward its full economic strength will never have the political influence which I believe it could and should exert within the United Nations, with the Western <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, and as the means for effecting n lasting detente between East and West: and  equally  in contributing in ever fuller measure to the solution of the  North-South  problem, to the needs of the developing world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in terms of Japan’s military trends in the future, in terms of its economic trends in the future, in terms of its alliances, the great test of whether it shall go nuclear, whether it shall stay under the American umbrella, whether it shall seek an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with Russia, what it shall do with trade, indeed the very challenge to our own mineral trade for the future - all of these things are in the yeasting at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister commenced his tirade of abuse this evening, the general idea was: The Labor Party has virtually had an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Government on immigration matters for 22 years; suddenly the new leaders of the Party are virtually on a path to treason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While on the one hand the Pope is offering prayers for the success of  President  Nixon’s visit to Peking and, at the other extreme, both India and the Soviet Union are expressing concern about the possibility of a new <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between China and the United States of America, we can get no intelligible statement whatsoever from this Government apart from the usual old anti-Communist claptrap it has been serving up for about 25 years that everything which is going on is the part of some Red plot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation is that under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the Commonwealth has the right in national cases - cases relating to standard hours, long service leave and the basic wage or, as it is now, the national wage - to intervene not in <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with either employer or employee but in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a series of widesweeping statements yesterday the Attorney-General labelled some of the staff Marcusian, the new left, members of the Workers’s Students <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and members of the Communist Party, and in case he missed out anything he added the phrase ‘and a whole host of Others’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Jumping a little ahead to some of  Senator Carrick’s  remarks, I wonder what our foreign advisers would be telling our Minister for Foreign Affairs if, through some peculiar <span class="highlight">alliance</span> - nothing is impossible in politics - some of the ultra right in this country were assisting in some way to cause a disturbance in Yugoslavia which could result in the Red fleet utilising the port facilities of Rijeka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that one of the points she wants to make is to give some vehicle for her colleagues in the Labor Party to use this forum to express their opposition not only to the National Service Act but also to the United States and the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> which Australia has with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that this evening  Senator Greenwood  would have done the same in regard to  Mrs McLean  rather than say cheaply and nastily that she has gone to gaol not only to give the ALP a voice in the Parliament against the National Service Act but also so that the whole question of the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, the ANZUS Pact, Vietnam and things of this nature can be raised in the Parliament just prior to the holding of a Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is of benefit to Australia not only in the long term eventuality of some possible attack on Australia, for which there is provision in Article 4 of the Treaty, but also right now in terms of Article 2 of the Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am proud to say that the governments I have supported in the past - and proudly supported - negotiated the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and the SEATO and ANZUS pacts and formed a comradeship with a nation which has brought greater peace and prosperity than any other nation has to this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam  stated: ‘Our mandate and duty is to maintain the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our mandate and duty to maintain the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> is equally clear, and this we will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it is a risk to the Australian Government was indicated by the attitude that we took, in <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States of America, in trying to stem that invasion at the expense of Australian servicemen and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maintenance of our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States under ANZUS remains most important for our security, since by its very nature it has created and guarantees in the Pacific a zone of peace in which the peoples of the region have for the last 20 years been free to pursue their political, economic and social goals without fear of hostile intervention or attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime, it sustains contact and co-operation in a variety of practical defence fields and in consultations about defence and security matters that are of advantage to all 3 partners in the <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One asks: Does the LiberalCountry Party put itself above the experts of the Western <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, because it was through this source that this information came to the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should interest members of the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party who are so enthusiastic about the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that by any test, including humanitarian considerations, the importance of a strong Britain in the western European <span class="highlight">alliance</span> or because of the great traditions and common origins that bind Britain and Australia, will the Commonwealth Government initiate immediately top level discussions with Great Britain and with countries with common interests and  responsibilities to determine what practical steps can be taken by Australia and other countries to help resolve Britain’s problems, particularly her energy crisis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This action of the Soviet Union has placed in jeopardy the very painfully and carefully constructed <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the left wing radicals in France which showed very great prospects of defeating the conservative Government which has been in power for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Australian Country Party in the Senate  (Senator Drake-Brockman),  as I understand he still is although one might be excused for having some doubts about whether he will be the Leader of the <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Party in Western Australia or whatever it calls itself, said: We want the matter adjourned for sufficient time to enable us to consider the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here all that the Liberal Party, the Country Party or its <span class="highlight">alliance</span> Party, the Democratic Labor Party, will do is combine, as they did before, to do everything they possibly can to prevent the people of Australia from having their say as soon as can be arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That is right, there needs to be a discussion between the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and the Country Party, the Bill has to be taken back to the Liberal Party, or there is a need to ascertain what somebody in the Australian Democratic Labor Party thinks about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It surprises me that the colleagues of the Country Party senator from Western Australia allied themselves with the Democratic Labor Party in what may be described as the national disaster <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and lost votes much more effectively than any other party in the whole of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can well imagine the DLP, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and the National Liberal Party being very interested to learn of the highly satisfactory financial arrangements which the Country Party had been able to build up over the years possibly as part of its deal with an insurance company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would be interested to learn from  Senator McManus  whether he is any better informed on some of the matters which we heard about tonight relating to the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> than he is with regard to some of the other matters relating to the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am just wondering whether  Senator McManus  knows any more about this matter which affects the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> than he does about some of the other matters affecting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, a miserable little organisation like the Country Party in Victoria which is groping and straining to form a national <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Australian Democratic Labor Party and which has no doubt made some approach to the National Liberal Party but which may have been spurned by a man of  Senator Hannan  ‘s integrity - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do say this- and we say it without any fear of contradictionthat the donations that have been made to the Australian Labor Party by any large financial institution, whether it is the Myer Emporium or anybody else, are infinitesimal when compared with the donations that have been made to the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that he might do so so I had some figures prepared concerning the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> in seats decided so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Europe, mainly because of the energy crisis, is in disarray; the Atlantic <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> is under great strain; United States-Russian relations have not improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and working defence relationship with the United States continue important of course- in terms of the global balance, of our regional standing, of the long-term contingency of serious deterioration in our strategic situation, and of the maintenance of the capability of our defence force in several important practical respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it should be there in order to meet an immediate threat- maybe a small threat, but an immediate one and one that no one can predict- and be capable of undertaking an instant defence or mobile job, maybe in respect of help to the United Nations, our continental defence or some South East Asian role under some <span class="highlight">alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are Steele Halls and all sorts of objects going around the sky- national liberal parties, national country parties, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So before 2 April  Senator Kane,  the Secretary of the Democratic Labor Party- and I suppose also a party to that Party’s <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Country Party- was aware of the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are about to have an election and this Government is about to face its masters- and it is about to learn that the people of Australia want to belong to the free world and want to honour our <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States and those ideals, practices and objectives which we have in common with the people of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is to accept what was rumoured in the newspapers, or leaked to the newspapers, if we had gone ahead with this it would have meant the end of the ANZUS treaty and an end to the <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the United States as we have always known it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the Senate is concerned we no longer have a situation in which a combination of members of the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> or whatever else it calls itself, and the Australian Democratic Labor Party can, by sheer numbers, outweigh the will of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As reported at page 2525 of the Senate Hansard of 7 June the Leader of the Australian Country Party in the Senate  (Senator DrakeBrockman),  as he was then although I understand that he is now the Leader of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, having been elected as such at the recent election, said at the conclusion of his speech: Therefore we in the Country Party oppose this legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That just demonstrates the divisions which exist within the country Party, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> or whatever one likes to call it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least he won back his seat in this Parliament under the flag of the Country Party, unlike some other members, particularly those in this chamber, who got their seat back under the flag of the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and who all of a sudden, because it was so unpopular, changed back to the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You should not be mentioning anything about Queensland because you will recall that when it looked like there would be an election for half of the Senate, you divided and formed an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be very interested to see, when the vote is taken tonight, whether the Country Party or the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> again turn their backs on the representatives of the Country Party in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I talk about the political philosophy which is held by those on the other side of this chamber I include all the various crews, all the various people and all the various parties whether they be the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, the Country Party or the Liberal-Country league. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it would be far better for the honourable senator, if this is to be the level of his independence, to formalise the matter, take out an application and join the Liberal Party of Australia, the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, the Liberal-Country League or the National Liberal Party or whatever may be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some members of that unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between the Australian Democratic Labor Party, which has passed on, and  Senator Webster’s  party said: ‘Look, we have not got the big battalions like the big parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly perhaps than anything else, Australian firms or Australian based firms that have gone overseas rather than put up with the Minister’s policies- which have been aptly described by some of my colleagues as the policies of a banana republic- because they reckon that when they go overseas they are dealing with governments with which they can deal, which is not the case with this mob, include the Australian Oil and Gas, Australian Associated Resources, <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>, Beach, South Pacific, Endeavour, Broken Hill Pty, Magellan, Hartogen and Target companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is quite separate from the argument which I have put against the Opposition’s claim in respect of the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span> and what has been done to obtain a peaceful relationship with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in an address at a symposium conducted in Sydney on 7 June 1973 during the Australian Insurance Institute Annual Conference,  Mr D.  G.

    <p>Looking at this consideration of these 2 measures, we find an unholy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of the AIDC and the NIF joined together with a national interest situation floating around somewhere in mid-air between them and being extremely difficult to identify. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Max Wechsler said that the Trotskyist organisations- that is, the Socialist Workers League and the Socialist Youth <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>- are revolutionary organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was indicating the way in which there had been an infiltration of the Australian Labor Party by certain Trotskyist organisations and I had referred specifically to the Socialist Workers League and the Socialist Youth <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Socialist Youth <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> has already enjoyed an incredible success in Young Labor circles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what ought to be a matter of concern is the method used by the Socialist Workers League and the Socialist Youth <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> to be re-admitted to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am of the opinion that when people seek election to this Parliament under a party flag, are successful, sit in the Parliament and then for political reasons go to election under the flag of another party and are returned- as  Senator DrakeBrockman  under the National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>- it is a deception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has to be agreed that the South Australian Government Insurance Office is running at a loss, but what one has to take into account in considering the South Australian Office is that it is a very new office, it has been functioning for only a few years and it has not had time to establish itself on a competitive basis, quite unlike the case, for example, of Sun <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Insurance Limited which is the descendant of the oldest insurance office in the world and yet requires something like nearly 40 per cent of its premium income to pay for its commissions and other expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall not detain the Senate for any great length of time; but I think it is only proper to indicate that the comments to which I referred and in respect of which the response which  Senator Melzer  read is given were made by a person who had been active in the Socialist Youth <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> and the Socialist Workers League. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime, at the instigation of the Canberra meddlers, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia  (Mr Anthony),  who were terrified, of course, lest the bitter division between their coalition subsidiaries in Western Australia should spill over and break or set asunder the cosmetic <span class="highlight">alliance</span> that was holding the federal coalition together, prevailed upon Queensland’s Kissinger to fly in and set things straight in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trouble goes back almost 2 years when  Mr Anthony,  the Country Party Leader in the other place, desperately seeking to preserve his own political prestige and from the ravages of a shrinking electoral base, persuaded the Western Australian Branch of the Party to enter into an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with these politically stone-age men, the denizens of the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright and I find ourselves in a happy <span class="highlight">alliance</span> tonight on the Family Law Bill because here we have a Bill which is admittedly out of date, which tries to create a Family Law Division in this Superior Court, well knowing that this Parliament and every member of the chamber on the opposite side has voted for a Family Law Bill which creates a completely separated court, a court in which the whole idea of a Family Law Division of the Superior Court was anathema because we did not want judges jumping from one jurisdiction to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Wright  would care to cast his mind back to the time when he was sitting on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when it was inquiring into the National Compensation Bill, he might well remember some evidence which was given to the original inquiry into rehabilitation and compensation in Australia by  Mr D.  G. Pettigrew, the managing director of Sun <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> Insurance Limited, which is a multinational and which is the oldest still existing insurance company in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason that no voice was uttered in this place, and I state this categorically, is because there was an emotive <span class="highlight">alliance</span> between those people who had made the incursions into southern Africa and Goa and a belief that they were liberating the people of southern Africa from the colonial yoke of the decayed and debilitated Portuguese empire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to me the lesson was this: As far as the Western powers- we could call them that or a loose <span class="highlight">alliance</span> of the ANZUS powers- are concerned, if we look at it strictly on percentage lines, we are no better off than we would have been if we had not worried about the futile war in Vietnam because by now the ideological rivalries between China and the Soviet Union concerning the land mass of Asia, in particular South Vietnam, would have been apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What happened was that a temporary <span class="highlight">alliance</span> was reached in order to try to retain both seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means, firstly, the possession by a foreign power or <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, hostile towards us, of maritime strength sufficient to overcome our own and gain substantial mastery of the seas around us, and the air space over them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are continued links with that shadowy organisation, the WorkerStudent <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> in SA which has been involved with some violence in factory situations and has used language glorifying violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder whether the Director-General has been watching the activities of that particular gentleman, or are we still concerned with what Bobby Gould is doing or what the Socialist Left <span class="highlight">Alliance</span> or some other organisation is doing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government will not yield to pressure to break the American <span class="highlight">alliance</span>, withdraw from the ANZUS treaty or divulge secrets about American defence bases in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, to judge the seriousness or otherwise of this matter, one has to say that in any assessment of the terms of any <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with our one great friend, the United States of America, one must have in mind that bipartisanship is the essential strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would expect in the next month to get detailed reports of all aspects of this crusade, which I have been waging in <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Sydney  Sun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lest one should attempt to score in these little matters, one should not overlook the civil war that arose out of the Adelaide conference of the Australian Labor Party and the enormous outpouring of criticism of its leader,  Mr Hayden,  because of his <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the extreme left wing of the Party and his condemnation of his colleague,  Mr Hawke,  and what he stood for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I enter this debate simply to say that all that we have heard from the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  and what is in the minds of  Senator Robertson  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Democrats  (Senator Mason)  simply justifies  Senator Webster’s  forming an <span class="highlight">alliance</span> with the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Second Front- Jennifer McCallum, Melbourne; the National Front; the Australian National <span class="highlight">Alliance</span>- ‘Audacity’; the National Resistance- ‘Advance’; the Divine People Movement, Sydney; the Campaign Against Illegal Immigrants, Perth; Awake Australians Campaign to Help Save South Africa; Zimmunism; Rights for Whites- that is a cute one; and One Law for All. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
