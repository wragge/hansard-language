<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Local Courts Ordinance 1941- 1965, section 84,  a  Judge or a Magistrate may allow a person to sue or defend  as a  poor person in a case where he considers  it  necessary for the attainment of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-32-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the outcome of the review of the terms of Australia’s acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> (Hansard, 13th May 1969, page 1734, question nos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present the report by the honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  R. M. Eggleston following his inquiry into academic salaries in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he propose to follow the Rhodesian example and take steps to change the name of his Department to the Ministry of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, Law and Order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he confer with State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in order to ascertain in which other gaols their use is permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was told on 25th March 1970 that leg irons had been placed on Tobebe as well as on Klak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-50-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to an oversight by the Visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, he did not post bis report dated 27th March 1970 until after 18th April 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-50-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer find no wrongdoing on the part of the Guild members and, whilst making no order for costs, did the judge say that he was sure that an application for payment of the Guild’s costs would be sympathetically considered by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I accept his proposition that he is not responsible for or even able to interfere with the workings of the court or give any instruction to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> about the order in which certain cases should be heard, I think it is worth while for the honourable member for Kingston  (Dr Gun)  to raise this question in the House because it surely makes clear even to honourable members on the other side of the House that we are appointing to the High Court of this country people who are more interested in the question of property than in the question of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter figure does not include adjustments which may result from implementation of the recommendations made last year by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney in the report of the Inquiry into Salaries of Lecturers and Senior Lecturers in Colleges of Advanced Education; nor does it take account of the effects of recommendations in respect of academic salaries made this year by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address a question to the Minister for Labour and National Service concerning the decision to release  Mr J.  Ross from Sale on advice received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that this advice was obtained after  Mr Ross  had refused to comply with and recognise the National Service Act and that the information received by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers was obtained in substantially a form of private hearing with  Mr Ross. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances will the Minister indicate whether he bad expected  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers to undertake this form of procedure and whether such forms of procedure are likely to be repeated should further cases of a similar nature arise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he confirm that the description of an accused as a ‘known demonstrator’ in court proceedings unrelated to demonstrations is prejudicial and subversive of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there special additional punishments applicable to foreign born citizens under certain sections of the Crimes Act; if so, are they acceptable in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the recent judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sheehy of the New South Wales Industrial Commission in which the learned judge criticised the victimisation of employees for reasons associated with their union activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he see any merit in the observations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sheehy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3) 1 do not consider it would be appropriate for me to comment upon  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sheehy’ s observations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night my 2 colleagues, the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  raised the question of what one might call <span class="highlight">justice</span>, for want of a better term, in the lower courts of both New South Wales and Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply want to place it on record that there are before us, if we care to look, ample cases in which lower courts have inflicted unjust penalties, have accepted police evidence against all the weight of the facts and have visited very serious injustice and hardship upon people in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the facets of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which we ought to turn our attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some previous Bills dealing with the collection of levies, certain questions concerning law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> have arisen in Parliament when the Bills were debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obnoxious to the idea of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which we in this country support, and frankly, I find it, as I said before, rather incredible that the Country Party would be wanting to put something in a Bill which could in fact lead to abuse and the penalising of primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright on the South Australian Police Force are considered relevant to the Northern Territory Police Force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright on the South Australian Police Force are considered relevant to the Australian Capital Territory Police Force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the words ‘<span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace’ have been inserted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that the Government cannot accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin),  if for no other reason than that it would be the first legislation of this character where there was a requirement that a person other than a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace should issue such a warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2), (3) and (4) The Government considers that these matters might best be considered after the report of the present enquiry into Parliamentary salaries and allowances by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr is received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he have these matters referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr for concurrent consideration with the salaries and allowances of Members of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bright enquired into matters connected with a moratorium demonstration in the streets of Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the AttorneyGeneral commissioned a committee consisting of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason, the Solicitor General  (Mr Ellicott)  and Professor Whitmore of the Australian National University, known as the Commonwealth Administrative Law Review Committee, to report on administrative law reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright on the South Australian Police Force are considered relevant to the Commonwealth Police Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister to a recent statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher to the effect that ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do this in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a man who has sent me a telegram. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say - and I think in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to  Mr Maher  that I should mention what was told to me for the first time - that he has 2 sons who were knocked about in a motor accident and were not eligible for service in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 stand by everything else I said but I must do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who feel they have been wronged in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In earlier legislation relating to similar Bills, the Parliament debated certain clauses concerning matters of ‘law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the honourable member to paragraph 128 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s report following his 1971 inquiry into the salaries and allowances of members of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-35-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Western Australia-(i) The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Western Australia; (ii) The Chief Electoral Officer for the State; (iii) The SurveyorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the review of the terms of Australia’s acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> yet been concluded, if  so,  with what result (Hansard, 23rd February 1971, page 543). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review of the terms of Australia’s acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, mentioned in my predecessor’s answers to the honourable member’s previous questions, has been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5480 concerning the review of the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act,  will  he say  whether  he is persisting with his proposals  to  amend  the Act to  permit police interception in such  areas  of crime as (a) extortion, (b) kidnapping  and(c)  attempts to pervert the course of  <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the report which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jenkyn made on 8th February 1972 on the operation of the English Divorce Reform Act, 1969, not tabled before 1 June 1972 (Senate Hansard, page 2430). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who is now a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the House that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in his judgment stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the recent bomb outrages and threats of bombing in Sydney, what action is the Government taking not only to bring the perpetrators of these outrages to <span class="highlight">justice</span> but also to clarify the origins and basis of such terrorist activities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Predominantly the responsibility for implementing the results of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s recommendations lies not merely with the Federal Parliament and Federal Government tout also with State governments as most &lt;of the areas to which he referred are specifically within the responsibility of State legislatures rather than the Federal legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister inclined to agree that the law is heavily weighted against the poor and uneducated and in favour of white collar criminals, and that this in itself is enough reason for us to take the comments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox very seriously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to dissolve the Parliament without restoring salary <span class="highlight">justice</span> to back bench members as recommended last year by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the undersigned believe that hunger, illiteracy, abject poverty and injustice are intolerable anywhere in the world; that the knowledge, skills and resources to change these unjust conditions now exist; that to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> among peoples, world financial and trading systems can and must bc changed; iba! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first acts that my Government took was to request that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> among peoples, world financial and trading systems can and must be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a satisfactory conclusion to these discussions is not reached Australia is in a position to apply forthwith to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the recent unsuccessful attempts and appeals to the French Government to suspend or to cease its series of nuclear tests in the Pacific area, is it the intention of the Australian Government to join with the New Zealand Government and to proceed to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> without further delay and by so doing to indicate to the French Government that we will not be treated in such a contemptuous fashion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  may I inform the House that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise,  Senator Murphy,  left Australia on Sunday, 13th May, to present Australia’s case against French nuclear testing in the Pacific to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development been drawn to a report in today’s Press of statements made separately by the GovernorGeneral and by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia in which they criticise the centralisation of offices and industry in inner city areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But a study is presently being undertaken by a Commission of Inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recently wrote to my good friends in the Australian Medical Association suggesting that when the current proceedings of the Medical Fees Tribunal, headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, are concluded negotiations should be entered into to establish some regularised system of fees review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>, (5) and (6) All persons concerned can be assured that in applying any scheme of rationalisation which might be adopted for the industry, their accrued rights would be protected and special effort would be made to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span> in every respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from the evidence given to the part-heard Commission of Inquiry into Land Tenure’s being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell who is  Chairman,  Professor R.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I felt that possibly the greatest breakthrough in this particular sphere of allowing, permitting and encouraging migrants to know about their rights and privileges as Australian workers came when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, in handing down a decision, said that that decision would be made available in the languages of the people who had been concerned in the dispute and who had been encouraged to come and work in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to ensure that the example set by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore is followed by all his colleagues in the Australian and State spheres, wherever relevant and possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Secondary Industry whether he is aware of a report attributed to the former member for Parramatta,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, wherein he said, among other things, that nationalisation of the legal profession was favoured by some Federal Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree with these remarks attributed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bowen said in this House on one occasion that be saw very considerable merit in the establishment of such an institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he see a conflict between the Commission’s charter to extract phosphate at the lowest possible cost and the provision of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to workers in an Australian territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The preparation of the report is in the hands of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I just say to the honourable member for Maranoa that his remarks tonight did not do him <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has not done so, will he also point out in the letter that the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Knox,  put forward a figure of 30,000 illegal entrants in the past 7 months under the easy visa system and that he was 30 times wrong as the figure is 1,000 or less? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> pass a resolution by 11 votes to 3 expressing its strong disapproval of the making, circulating or publishing of statements by him purporting to anticipate or forecast the manner in which the Judges of the Court would cast their votes, and reiterating its view that such statements are incompatible with the fundamental principle governing good administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I shall not answer any questions bearing on the deliberations of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> particularly while litigation involving Australia is pending before that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has rebuked him concerning a statement made in 1973 about theprobable result of the nuclear test case pending  in  the Court between Australia and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, sir, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> a few days ago criticised the terms of the Proclamation as setting out in too much detail what in fact we should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Immediately I had concluded my speech I found a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and made the statutory declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A comprehensive inquiry is being conducted by a very competent commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, into the security operations of Australian security organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not going to pre-empt that inquiry nor make any statement until the Government has a report from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only want to underline one point made by my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  that is, that as a result of section  136  it is the federal incorporated body that owns property, and that under the arrangements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney the State branch would not be able to own property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What actions have been taken by the Government to develop further the ANZUS Treaty as an instrument for (a) <span class="highlight">justice</span>, (b) peace, (c) political advancement, (d) social advancement and (e) economic advancement in the Pacific area since 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney was appointed to the royal commission I was unaware that he was a trustee of the ‘Noongah’ Fund, just as I was unaware that the father of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party was also a trustee of the ‘Noongah* Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-For the first time in speaking on a Bill relating to Papua New Guinea I have been remiss in that I did not pay the credit that is due to those Australians who have administered <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Papua New Guinea through the courts, particularly those personnel who served on the Supreme Court and who served with such distinction, sometimes under difficult conditions and sometimes despite many frustrations with the conditions of their service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable gentleman that one of the reservations was that Australia would not submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in relation to Australia’s continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One which comes to mind involved  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-82">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amends the Grants Commission Act 1973 to enable a  chairman,  such as the present  chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, who immediately before his appointment was a judge of a federal or state court to have the same designation, rank, status and precedence as a judge of the Austraiian Capital Territory Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) These questions were overtaken by the appointment, on 21 August 1974, of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to conduct an inquiry under the Royal Commissions Act into the intelligence and security services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-49-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What occurred between 25 October 1974 when he signed a letter to me, in which he said the Noongah fund could be involved or could fall within the terms of reference of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Sweeney’s inquiry, and 30 October, 1 974 when it is reported that, to his knowledge, as far as the Noongah fund is concerned, it has nothing to do with the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition took the view that the Commissioner’s powers in this regard were too wide and that if an occupier did not consent the Commissioner should have to go before a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and obtain an order or a warrant of some description to enable him to enter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 29 October 1968 Attorney-General Bowen asked a committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, later Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and now the Governor-General, to consider the jurisdiction to be given to the proposed Commonwealth Superior Court to review administrative decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Governor-General has published the letter he received on 10 November from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> concerning the action upon which he had determined and to which he resorted the following day, will the Attorney-General obtain and table a copy of the letter which the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> later sent to the other Justices of the High Court to justify his covert and unilateral advice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, is what is now being called tax indexation merely a recognition that in the presence of continuing inflation tax <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands regular, perhaps even annual, adjustments of tax schedules- a practice not followed by earlier Liberal-Country Party governments but begun by Labor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter raised by the honourable member for Chifley concerned a statement reportedly made by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales,  Sir Laurence  Street, alleging impropriety in respect of a letter received by him from the honourable member for Macquarie  (Mr Gillard). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To attempt to pervert the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is a crime well known to the law, and indeed ranks high on the criminal calendar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a consequence of these unfortunate utterances, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> himself has more than likely committed contempt of the Federal Parliament- an institution to which, despite his exalted position, he is accountable and from which he has no immunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples to members of the Commission- both the commissioners and  deputy  presidents, I believe- was a matter of public comment and record before any copies came from my office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations: When did he first learn that members of his personal staff released copies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter on the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill to members of the Parliamentary Press Gallery on the night of Thursday, 1 1 October? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reveal now that I am informed that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, with the knowledge of the Government, has had a tap on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples ‘s private telephone for nearly three weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government have any evidence of the extent of the circulation of the letter of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of this legislation provided an opportunity for the Government to provide a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Commonwealth Government employees who, through injury or disease, are permanently or partially incapacitated and are not able in whole or in part to discharge their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore provided an opportunity for the Government to give social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the families of those government employees whose death had deprived their families of their breadwinners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an opportunity for this Government to resolve areas of anomalies within the Act and at the same time to produce legislative remedies that could overcome the inordinate delays that bedevil the present administration of the Act- delays of such duration that they are a paramount cause of hardship and legal injustice to many Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  knows, the wheels of <span class="highlight">justice</span> turn slowly and could well take over two years to turn from the date on which the loss occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the best way to resolve this problem is to quote from the  Chairman  of the Development Assistance Committee which is under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - the authority, and the only authority, that examines aid programmes and which makes comments upon the size, equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is desirable, because of the enormous difficulties of one people ruling another with <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that there should be as much consensus as possible in this House as to what should be done in Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one should go to those same Ministerial Members and suggest that the Government should take their land there would be a violent reaction in the other direction - a denial of powers to act or of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in acting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Association of Professional Engineers of Australia, the Professional Officers Association and the Association of Architects Engineers Surveyors and Draughtsmen of Australia knew, too, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright .and  Mr Commissioner  Portus, who had heard the 1961 and 1962 engineering cases, had stated that the Board’s interim offer was not enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anybody knew what the rate ought to be, it was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright and  Mr Commissioner  Portus because in 1961 and 1962 they had made an assessment of the rates which represented a completely new charter for the professional engineers of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The associations knew that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright and  Mr Commissioner  Portus would constitute a majority on the bench of the Commission which would finally decide the matter, and therefore they were entitled to assume that there would be some increases in salaries above those which the Public Service Board had fixed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the first interpretation, the most experienced arbitrators -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright and  Mr Commissioner  Portus, who both sat on the previous engineering cases in 1961 and 1962 - stated that the amounts granted were not enough, though for differing reasons, but  Mr Chambers  and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore said that the amounts granted were correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, many members are saying that the Commission has taken advantage of such policies, and that’ there appears to be no room for temperate and responsible policies if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be achieved before the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hindmarsh made the remarkable statement that the associations were entitled to expect that they would have a majority because two of the members of the bench - the presiding judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright, and Commissioner Portus - had sat on an earlier engineers’ case and granted big increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will read from page 8 of the roneoed copy of the judgment delivered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another extract that ought to be brought to the attention of the House is from page 7 of the roneod copy of the joint majority decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and  Mr Arbitrator  Chambers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it can properly be said that in the event two members of the Public Service Arbitration Act bench -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and  Mr Arbitrator  Chambers - decided to treat the Board’s rates as proper rates and to make determinations accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presiding member of the two benches -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright - and  Mr Commissioner  Portus were of the view that higher rates were warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Attorney-General will have noted, I am sure with interest, the ruling by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox that under the criminal law which applies in the Australian Capital Territory it is not permissible for the police to fingerprint persons in custody unless that course is necessary for identification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He points out that one of the problems of New Guinea <span class="highlight">justice</span> is that it has a long tradition in which the District Commissioner was the magistrate, the District Commissioner was ako the head of the police which made the accusation and the District Commissioner was in charge of the prison in which the offender was goaled, and that too often the distinction between law and administrative convenience was blurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, here in Australia, we can build a society that is secure and yet free; which encourages enterprise and yet gives social <span class="highlight">justice</span>; which expands its economy yet preserves and improves its cultural and physical surroundings; if we can build such a society - and we can - we will become the wonder and the example of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addressing a question to the Attorney-General I refer to the report of the committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Manning presented in May 1964, which made recommendations concerning bills of exchange, including cheques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does accept in substance all the recommendations of the committee that was headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Manning, and it is proposed in the current sessional period to introduce legislation which was foreshadowed in the Governor-General’s Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does seem though, as honourable members from this side have pointed out, that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  with all his great talk about social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and what he would do for the people of Australia, has proved that he is a bits and pieces and patch up man in respect of social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At dusk, after the mass demonstration had ended, a small segment of the crowd, members of radical splinter groups, moved across Constitution Avenue to the Labour and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department buildings where they burned United States flags, threw paint bombs and other missiles and were repelled by tear gas released by the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is the right of the farmers to walk down the streets of Melbourne to seek economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> - and I support them - surely it is the right of men who feel appalled that their Government is supporting actions in Vietnam which are equal to the Nazi atrocities in the Second World War to demonstrate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not read them out fully, but I think it worth pointing out to the House just what the recommendations of the Nimmo Committee are because it is implied in the way in which the Opposition has framed its request for the discussion of this matter of public importance - although the honourable member for Oxley, who has just spoken, in <span class="highlight">justice</span> did put a qualification on it - that the Nimmo Committee in a way supported the approach of the Labor Party with respect to hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1940, the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  O’Mara in the then Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, ruled that an award of the Court could validly attach conditions to the earning and receipt of wages (and overtime) and insist on those conditions being met before any money became due to an employee covered by the award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now the higher courts of Papua and New Guinea have declared that Councillor To Rangis was denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Minogue, speaking of two of the other men we visited, has said that they were denied counsel; that they were denied witnesses; that certain evidence should have been admitted; that they were denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, and that their trial was a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and it should be quashed and a new trial held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then a year ago, in an address to the Australian Conservation Foundation,  Sir Percy  Spender, Q.C., a distinguished former Commonwealth Minister and member of this House who later became  President  of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, expressed the view that the off-shore rights of the Commonwealth under the Australian Constitution were as complete and as exclusive of the rights of the States as those established by the Supreme Court of Canada as belonging there to the Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I should mention also that in August 1969, in the case of Bonser v. La Macchia the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer look occasion to state their considered opinion on the respective off-shore rights of the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three justices did not consider the matter further at all, one did so, but without finding it necessary to decide the further questions involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgments of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and  Sir Victor  Windeyer do not therefore constitute a formal decision by the full High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States are not prepared to accept as definitive the judgments of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer in Bonser v. La Macchia, it is their right to commence proceedings which will raise squarely for decision by the full High Court any issues they wish to contest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is clear, and was expressly recognised by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer in Bonser v. La Macchia, that pre- 1900 the colonies were competent, as the States still are, by virtue of their plenary power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory assigned to them, to make laws that would operate extra-territorially - that is to say, beyond their land boundaries and in and on the territorial sea and, where necessary, the high seas beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear from the figures that I have quoted that members of the Country Party, if they were sincere on this issue, would come out and support us in our attempt to gain a little more <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the rural producer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to such matters as the extent of discretionary powers and regulation making powers; the provision of appeals in appropriate cases from administrative determinations; the observance of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> in administrative proceedings; the conferring of powers of entry, search and arrest; retrospective legislation; departures from the ordinary rules of evidence; and onus of proof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the second part is that as I understand the position - I hope I will be corrected by anyone who has a different view - the late  Dr Evatt  did resign from this Parliament to take up a position as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Jeff Bate)  has brought forward a motion and ample time should have been given for it to be debated by this House, but because of the peculiar circumstances in which we are placed today there just is not time to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to any section of it or even to make a broad statement of the fact that the Government is very conscious of what is going on and what is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick said quite frankly and forthrightly that he would not take any notice of the representations of either the Commonwealth or the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now that the judgment of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> with respect to the North Sea continental shelf case has been given and the full significance of it is beginning to appear,I for one believe there are dramatically new and highly critical considerations to be canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> goes straight to that point and says that, irrespective of theconvention on the continental shelf, since the beginning of time, where the continental shelf is appurtenant to a State, that State has sovereignty over the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quoted on these previous occasions the remarks which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, sitting as a judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, had made early in 1962 on these archaisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I drew this to the attention of the Attorney-General in a question on 1 1 th March last, lt will be remembered that Mt <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, the primary judge of the Supreme Court in the Australian Capital Territory, had acquitted one of  Mr <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not inappropriate that today, the day of the visit of the Prime Minister of Canada, formerly Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Canada, we should pay some heed in practice to the notable statement he made that the Government has no place in the bedrooms of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that that committee was chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Manning of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and that its report was presented to Parliament on 12th October 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only suggest that, while what he said may have some element of truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, there is not very much point at this stage in trying to bring in the whole field of education beyond and below the level dealt with in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Eggleston also recommends that in future there should be automatic adjustments in academic salaries following national wage case decisions, and stales that the percentage increases recommended in the report are calculated on the assumption that automatic adjustments will be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided that it will contribute its normal share of any increases approved bv the State governments up to the limits proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, with effect from 1st January 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Premiers and State Ministers for Education have received copies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s report and have been informed of the Government’s intentions, lt is for each Stale Government to decide whether it will support the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston makes certain suggestions about the manner in which future inquiries should be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston made his fundamental survey for this report in 1964 and what he is doing now, apart from making suggestions about colleges of advanced education and one or two other matters, is updating the actual salary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite clearly the main consideration which has activitated  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston in his decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there are any reasons to assume that the- State governments will not co-operate now that the Commonwealth Government has made so clear its intention to follow the procedures in this respect recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, however, one other problem and this is referred to in the report at page 16 where  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made in the State submissions to the fact that any determination of academic salaries as a result of this report would have repercussive effects on the salaries paid to teachers in colleges of advanced education, as a consequence of the recommendations made by my colleague  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as any of my recommendations may have the consequence of raising the salaries of other persons who have similar claims based on comparative wage or salary <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I cannot feel that this is a factor which should cause me to hold my hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened in the case of academic salaries was that the State governments did request the Commonwealth to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston to go into the question of these salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston has recommended that the result of a national wage case should be applied to academic salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I realise that, but I will explain it in this way: What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston has recommended for academic salaries normally applies to awards for people actually in work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this will happen because if the present Government of South Australia does not succeed in introducing some measure of relief into areas such as the one in which 1 live, where some farmers still have earth floors in their houses, there will be a grave miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> because of the fact that a proportion of their income in that area, due to the city milk price being higher than the manufacturing price, takes the ratio beyond the SO-SO set down in this Bill as the minimum condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the quota plan is to prevail then common <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that the principle of a minimum wage accorded the worker should be extended to the wheat grower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not had advice from the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Hughes)  or from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or anybody else, but as 1 see it, if you impose a levy, as it is called in these Bills, on a commodity, it then becomes an excise or duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member started off by saying that this issue was  a  denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not merely by way of instinct but also by way of discipline that I warm to any suggestion that there has been any denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that a person has not had the opportunity to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The lad said to the commanding officer that he would accept the summary <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the commanding officer, and subsequently he was awarded 28 days detention, lt might be a matter of judgment as to whether in all the circumstances that sentence was adequate or severe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps if in the interests of human <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and of truth, the news media and journals of our day can find the courage to publish my letter to you,I may find truth, or perhaps,  Mr Prime  Minister, time may show that my son did not die in vain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With this information we could bring the scheme to an end, with <span class="highlight">justice</span> being done to the settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote from  Dr Bray  who is now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Frankfurter had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a careless, slipshod and lazy way of administering <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed out that it contained real bias against industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should have been treated in much the same way as the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> when AttorneyGeneral treated the Matrimonial Causes Bill, the Marriage Act, the restricted trade practices legislation and the copyright legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This does not allow <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done on a matter that is so vital to the interests of over 300,000 Commonwealth employees and also national servicemen militia and men serving in certain sections of the forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the one major recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s report which I believe is educationally unfortunate, namely, the award of a lesser percentage increase at the bottom of the lecturing scale than at the higher levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I point out to the honourable member that the report was obtained from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston and his assessors at the request of State governments, which have a very large financial stake in the question of salaries for professors and lecturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was announced at the time,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, agreed to undertake the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- The Minister for the Army  (Mr Peacock)  has tabled the report of thu Committee of Inquiry into the Royal Military College, Duntroon, headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his Committee was submitted to the Minister on 24th April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other things, the judgment contains these gems of wisdom from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said in the last paragraph of the judgment <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy agreed with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Morgan, for whose knowledge of the law I have a profound respect, very reluctantly had to admit that in his opinion that is what it meant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No wonder tradesman’s assistants are noi able to get wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission when Commissioners make stupid statements like that - that any person with average intelligence can become a good tradesman’s assistant in a very short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote now from a judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins in the Engine Drivers case contained in the fifth volume of the Commonwealth Arbitration reports at page 27. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins once remarked on the fact that although in theory the court had power to decrease wages as well as to increase them, every case he had ever handled had been to interfere by way of increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can afford to stand flat footed against all demands for wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> because he knows that arbitration will never order him to grant that which a free trade union movement could obtain by direct action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why was the Visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for Kerevat Corrective Institution advised on 25th March U970 that leg irons were placed upon the detainee Klak between 3rd December 1969 and 18th February 1970 but not advised that they were also placed upon the detainee Tobebe between 5th and 17th March 1970 (Hansard,8th May 1970, page 1941). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-50-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why did the Visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s reportof 27th March not reach the Administrator until after his report of 18th April (Hansard, 8th May 1970, page 1941). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-50-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the death of the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright made it necessary for the Association of Professional Engineers of Australia to abandon its High Court action against the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission’s decision to disregard the view of some of its own members in favour of the view taken by the Public Service Board on salaries for professional engineers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-53-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether he has had the opportunity to consider the reported statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo to ihe effect that the inquiry into health insurance over which he presided produced evidence of ‘appalling social and economic distress in this affluent country’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth, of course, and indeed the Parliament, has considered the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo on how to best provide the best health scheme for the people of this country and the Government and the Parliament have taken action to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members on this side of the House are amazed to think that the Government would deny <span class="highlight">justice</span> to one of its supporters and not allow him to express views publicly which could mean so much to him electorally, lt is for this reason that the amendment has been moved today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I place on record tonight my personal appreciation and that of the Medlyn family for the <span class="highlight">justice</span> - no doubt delayed <span class="highlight">justice</span> - which has been received by the suffering Medlyn family because of war injuries sustained by this man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that be received SI 0,000 in back money - a net amount of just on $7,000 - indicates at least that at this stage the Repatriation Department has rectified what I considered to be a grievous injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department is reported to be currently examining the joint ownership of newspapers, television and broadcasting stations to see whether the Anti-Monopoly Act is being violated, and where it finds such violations have occurred, it will undoubtedly call on the FCC to refuse to renew the licences and issue them to other applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the Prime Minister’s promise, despite the emergence of a new Treasurer, despite a year of work by the Treasury, we are no nearer a real revision of the tax schedules, no nearer <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity in personal taxation, no nearer that fairer redistribution of wealth and fairer distribution of burdens which should be one of the prime objects of taxation in an enlightened community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Thursday, 20th August, a request was made to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor that the case be heard by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales on the grounds that the men had been denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that their actions did not constitute in law contempt of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Taylor held that there could be an arguable complaint about a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and he was concerned whether their conduct constituted contempt of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of this the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> refused to assemble the Court this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be forgotten that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> had the same material before him as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor had last week and at that time I remind the House that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor stated that there was an arguable case, yet with the High Court the matter could not even be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The answer to such situations is not increasing repression, or what the Government likes to call ‘law and order’, but to give equal <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  I ask the Attorney-General to tell us whether the rule of law is to apply equally, whether we are to grant <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all citizens equally across the board, or whether it is only to be granted to those whose political standards are similar to those of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spent some time with the honourable member explaining to him that it was no part of my function as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to intervene in any way so as to influence the justices of the High Court and, in particular, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, who disposes the Court’s administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The judgment handed down by his honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer was in the form to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred and in consequence both the Guild and the Seamen’s Union have made application to the Government for a consideration of whether there should be a reimbursement of the costs incurred by both the Guild and the Seamen’s Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to the reported claim by the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> that, in accord with the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Worthing case, when this House passes the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill that could lead to the successful establishment of floating brothels and casinos outside the control of the State police forces? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have read a newspaper report of some remarks attributed to my State colleague,  Dr Delamothe,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise to the House that there is a world of difference between ownership, which is the concept that the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Queensland has iri mind, and sovereignty, lt is quite erroneous in my judgment for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Queensland to suggest that State laws will cease to have any application when the Commonwealth legislation, that is, the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill, is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remarks attributed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Queensland seem to overlook completely the provisions of clause 13b of the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill, because clause 13b expressly provides that nothing in the preceding provisions of the Bill is to be taken as limiting or excluding the operation of any law of a State in force at the date of the commencement of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of the weak attempts by a succession of honourable members on the other side of the House has lessened the natural antagonism of all fair-minded Australians to this gross miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I inquire whether he is still forcibly endeavouring to encourage the Government to introduce this provision which even the honourable member for Holt, who preceded me in this debate, contends is so necessary if people are to receive the <span class="highlight">justice</span> they deserve? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is not inclined to concern himself seriously about this matter I hope that in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Australian ex-servicemen, who are getting a pretty raw deal under the provisions of the Budget, the Prime Minister might have a discussion with the Minister for Repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>rise to speak in this debate with some sorrow because in the 12 years that I have spent in this Parliament I have found, whether it be on the eve of the 1959 Melbourne Peace Conference when the Attorney-General,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who is now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia spoke, or on the occasion of the conference in Sydney in 1964 when  Sir Robert  Menzies spoke, that on each occasion a statement has been made in an attempt to smear certain citizens who stand up for their inalienable rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be given, that adjustment must be made to offset this decline in the purchasing power of money and it must be made in sufficiently frequent intervals to enable these people to keep pace with this continual decline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is because these unfortunate males have not formed themselves into a union or pressure group to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> and if anything screams for <span class="highlight">justice</span> it is the situation of these unfortunates who, probably through a desire not to disgrace their children, did not contest the divorce petition, perhaps because they were not in a position to pay the exorbitant legal costs charged in divorce cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in 1964 a decision was made in the Equity Court in New South Wales by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Myers in a case involving Bayer Pharma Pty Ltd which is a subsidiary of Sterling Drug Inc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department in March of this year charged in Washington that Bristol Myers had conspired with 2 other big drug companies to monopolise the sale of a major antibiotic and thus to keep its price artificially high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of the information and the charges made by the United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department this was a clear monopoly activity - ‘oligopoly’ would be the more correct term - by Bristol Myers conspiring with other companies to restrict the provision of a particular drug on the market so that prices could be maintained at a high level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the officers committed for trial at the Supreme Court was tried before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kelly but was acquitted, the judge saying that in view of the evidence given by Crown witnesses and the contradictions of evidence given by Crown witnesses, and in view of the medical evidence, he was not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By any reasonable social scale of human and social economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> the increases proposed are totally inadequate for the needs of people in the community today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no moral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this sort of practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Their need is greater than mine and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that greatest benefit from social welfare programmes must go to areas of greatest need as a priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such comparisons are specious and do not assist in securing <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While wage and salary earners have access to machinery to obtain wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the pensioner is at the complete mercy of the Government in securing a just deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, as tends to happen, unless people are in a strong pressure group they do not get <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very briefly I want to bring to the notice of the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  a matter which I think exemplifies the need to amend the Social Services Act in order to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to migrants and Australians generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Up to date statistics for expenditure on law enforcement, as on so many other matters of crucial public concern, are unavailable but I have been able to ascertain that in the 5 years between 1957-58 and 1962-63 the States increased their per capita outlay for the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> by 26 per cent, for police by 27 per cent and for penal establishments by 35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the amounts provided by the Government in the Budget are  insufficientand if theconsideration which  it has given to the compensation plans submitted to it by the Returned Services League fall short of what that organisation sought and of what honourable members on this side of the House believe would be ordinary <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the Minister, together with those who comprise the Ministry deserves to be criticised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each year the National Executive of the RSL asks that a certain measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> be given to ex-servicemen, but just as easily the Government pushes the request aside and gives no consideration at all to the compensation plan presented by the RSL. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, will he make inquiries and if there is such an allegation will he make arrangements with his colleague, the Attorney-General, to have a Supreme Court judge made available to inquire into the allegations so that  Mr Gelmanovski  himself does not have to pursue the alternative of instituting expensive legal proceedings and so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will have the appearance of being done in the matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On what date didthe Minister approve of the recent regulations which led to his request on 10th August 1970 for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers to examine whether Brian James Ross in fact held conscientious beliefs which did not enable him to undertake military service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s statement that there are still no regulations which authorised his reference to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers, will he state why this innocent young man was permitted to serve 11 months in prison before the Minister bothered to take any action to have his case examined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in view of the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers made his report to the Minister on 7th September 1970, how does he explain the fact that  Mr Ross  was permitted to remain in prison for 14 days after the learned judge had found that  Mr Ross  holds conscientious beliefs which do not allow him to engage in any form of military service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That objection might have been taken when prices were payable but today they are completely unpayable and the farmer knows that he needs to claim <span class="highlight">justice</span> and he needs political representatives who will fight for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be noted, however, there was a minority opinion from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies that tended to the view that an objection could be sustained even if it were only to a war being waged at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies’ view a conscientious belief against serving in any war now being waged would suffice for exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something of the absurdity of the present status of the law is implicit in the finding by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers in the Brian Ross case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers, goes on to say at page 4 of his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman relies for the authority for that statement on a judgment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He relies solely upon the following excerpt from a judgment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major part of his argument went to the adequacy of a person claiming conscientious objection on the well known ground, which I can best put by referring to the words of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick: ‘A present conscientious belief which does not allow of participation in military service of any kind at any time’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude my remarks with a quotation from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer in the Zarb case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something should be done to provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all sections of the community - not only wage earners but those on fixed incomes and those people whose incomes are uncertain, such as the farming section and so on - and to curb the capacity of those who are able to adjust their prices to suit themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It imposes a burden on people, such as pensioners, when if <span class="highlight">justice</span> were applied that burden should be carried by the wealthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is to be so - and again we get the ubiquitous ‘if - then there is a good deal of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in applying a sales tax in an ad valorem fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  will assure the House that this increased revenue will go back in full to the States for road maintenance and will not add to the S800m Treasury surplus alleged earlier in the debate so that State Ministers, in particular the responsible Western Australian Minister, will stop gaoling businessmen in the form of truck owners who happen to have a bad run and cannot pay the fines imposed by the special courts appointed to deal out this so-called <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is due to a basic misunderstanding of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the Opposition would seek to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What did the Government do to a former member of this House who dared stand in this House and seek an inquiry on a matter in which he thought <span class="highlight">justice</span> had to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the editors of Butterworth’s Fourth Edition of ‘Federal Industrial Laws’ at page 380 slate that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy exhibited some rather dubious reasoning when he ruled in the case of Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers’ Federation of Australia that an organisation, party to a batt, is concerned in that ban at every moment of time that the ban continues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In ‘Federal Industrial Laws’ at page 379 of the fourth edition, the editors quote, in part, the remarks of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy set out in part (I) of the answer to the honourable member’s question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 380 of the .same edition, the editors express the view that the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy in Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, because, as will be seen from the above, the editors do not express the view that the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy in the 1960 case at 2 F.L.R. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But that is on the basis that we did think that the imprisonment was unjust and contrary to what we could regard as natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of these conditions, demands for wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> for meat inspectors over a long period went ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been given to these Commonwealth Government employees, yet the Government can afford to bring 50 inspectors from New Zealand at a cost, most probably, of $65,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, after all this has been done, to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is administered fully, there is the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the United States Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee will be under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, C.M.G., a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court since 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can one possibly expect that the men of our fighting services will receive any <span class="highlight">justice</span> from him when he says that one of the main points of this committee of inquiry will be to investigate pay conditions, and when only yesterday in the House of Representatives he damned the suggestion of the Labor Party that our fighting men were entitled to better pay and conditions than they have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A Labor government would promptly act to establish wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> for our servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman turns back on the case he sought to make out I think he will be disposed to agree with me that such a suggestion verges on being an affront to the integrity of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think it quite beyond  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr for him in any way to say: ‘No, I must not accept this because it may embarrass the Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s integrity is completely beyond question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is readily conceded on all sides that the one who will preside over it,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, is able, highly intelligent and a man of the utmost integrity and of wide and varied experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our egalitarian society, where we judge that a man’s skill ought to be rewarded by the possession of skill, his willingness to work and the way in which he works, we believe that wages should be determined by relative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and not by the possession of industrial power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 27th December 1967  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher and Commissioner Winter in a joint statement from the Bench rebuked the present Treasurer for his attack upon the Commission’s decision in granting pay rises in the 1967 metal trades case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 66 of his reasons for judgment,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore pointed out that the previous statement of the Commission that ‘increases in prices are determined by those who fix prices’ is a truth that cannot be emphasised enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No-one can deny that it has been allowed and encouraged - one might say even forced - to depart from the original concept of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins who, years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasoning behind this section is very similar to the reasoning that lies behind the sub judice rule in courts of law - which is to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> appears to be done, and that the parties appearing appear to get a fair go, that the tribunal itself is protected and not subjected to pressures, because if it has to make a decision, and it has to make a decision sooner or later, it must appear, above all else, that when it does give that decision, it is made on the evidence before it and the submissions that are put to it and which can be answered before it; and not by what someone like the Prime Minister or any other Minister has said outside the tribunal and which cannot be answered before the tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court said that it would be absurd to suggest that the Arbitration Commission could ignore the economic consequences of a wage fixing decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If in this matter of public importance what is being alleged by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who shows his venom yet again against  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy - perhaps the whole thing is symbolic of this - is that the Arbitration Commission is capable of being influenced or coerced by things said by a Minister outside the Parliament, there is a clear implication that the members of the Arbitration Commission are ignoring their oaths of office, are breaking their oaths of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to draw the Minister’s attention to some other things that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston bad to say in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even this has been made possible only because the inquiry was carried out in haste and, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston himself indicates, without facing up to all the kinds of questions that might have been dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has emphasised in a recent North Sea case that what is known as the morphological concept is also inherent in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 was pleased when I heard on 10th August last that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers had been appointed to hear Ross’ case and at a later date to hear that Ross had been released. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, at page 235 of his judgment as reported in the Australian Law Journal, saw no great difficulty, for he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer at page 247 of his judgment as reported in the Australian Law Journal said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher recently grant a 35-hour week to coal miners on the ground, inter alia, that failure to accede to the union’s demand would lead to industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the Tribunal does not indicate that the prospect of industrial unrest was a ground upon which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher granted a 35-hour week to coal miners, lt is noteworthy that in his decision,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher said that the Tribunal instituted the proceedings ‘on its own motion when it became apparent that direct action in the form of strikes and threats of strikes rather than resort to arbitration was being used as the method for obtaining reduced ordinary hours for mine workers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-63">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if relevant, is one of the factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said before, a Federal Labor Government, in accordance with its policy, would assert ownership of the waters of the Great Barrier Reef and would, if necessary, fight in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to retain those waters if its actions were challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no evidence before me that I am prepared to pay any attention to of perjury by anybody, nor can 1 see any suggestion of any criminal conspiracy to pervert the ends of public <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and if I did I would not need any urging to send the papers to the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Duncan declined so to do and set about giving an oration to the standers-by and was arrested and charged with obstructing  the  police, convicted, and from that he appealed to a Court which consisted of Lord Hewitt the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, his Lordship  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Humphries, and his Lordship  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Singleton, and it may be well known that Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was a well known champion of liberties, civil and otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware of the statement made at the University of New South Wales by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, when he described the slow pace of anti-pollution efforts and warned Australians against putting off the issue any longer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote for the Minister the view that was expressed in 1968 by  Sir Richard  Kirby,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore who gave a unanimous judgment that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 2 great problems in a total economy are to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people who have to live out of incomes and therefore ate concerned about prices - the majority of them in an industrial economy are wage earners - and to cut the right sort of balance between that part of the total which we do not consume today and that which we invest; that is, to strike a proper balance between consumption and investment, and to realise we divide investment into 2 great fields, public investment and private investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again if one analyses the 6 per cent national wage increase, instead of emotionally over-reacting, it is clear that there was little room for any other decision if economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> was to prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr McMahon),  the former Treasurer, tonight said that the Government stood for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to examine this proposition of providing <span class="highlight">justice</span> for everyone to which this Government referred when it presented its last Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us compare that position with the hypocrisy of this Government which says that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> for everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One gets a little sick of hearing the pious statement that the Government believes in <span class="highlight">justice</span> for everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this year when the Government says that it believes in <span class="highlight">justice</span> for everyone we find that if a person rents a housing commission dwelling he has to pay in his rent the interest burden of 6 per cent which is the highest rate in the history of State housing authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beyond any doubt, had South Australia received the allocation recommended by the Federal Bureau of Roads there would not have been constant pressure from that State to obtain a semblance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to complete the Eyre Highway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this case merits not only sympathetic consideration but also that <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that an exemption should be granted without the formality of applying on the ground of hardship or for other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are not persuaded by the argument of social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> to support pension increases as I have recommended, let them be persuaded into supporting this motion by a simple matter of political self-preservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision is in effect a legislative statement of the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which the Commonwealth Industrial Court requires to be observed in disciplinary proceedings under the rules of organisations registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In earlier legislation relating to similar Bills the Parliament debated certain clauses which called into question matters of ‘law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that a little less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done to the people of Papua and New Guinea and that the organisation itself is being a little less than fair, considering the tremendous profits it is able to make, in charging $3 a minute for a call from the Territory to the Australian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter I want to deal with, because it raises the question of whether we believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, is the desire of the Leader of the Opposition to have  Mr Alan  Ramsey called before the Bar of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact it was established as long ago as 1955 when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cook indicated clearly the existence of 6 major wool pies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1964, just before he became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  wrote an article for the initial issue of the ‘Federal Law Review’, the journal of the Law School of the School of General Studies at the Australian National University, outlining the functions of such a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result, in about October last year, it became apparent that the ideal or model system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that had been achieved, with all the extra expense involved, with cases being heard quickly, was beginning to crumble and fall apart at the seams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position was, and still is, that each judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court is an additional judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and when  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs was Federal Judge in Bankruptcy, he was also an additional judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The backlog of cases and then, contradictorily, often the assembly line system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, also undermine respect for the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More especially there is the lack of particular attention for each case which comes before the court, and the failure of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to recognise that each human being who comes before the court is a human being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple procedures of <span class="highlight">justice</span> give him the capacity to deny what the Government would find it impossible to prove without a considerable back-up of inspectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were not struck because of a realisation of the socio-economic need of a substantial proportion of the population; nor were they introduced because of the imperatives of social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>; nor were they introduced because of a humanly inspired sense of moral concern for and obligation towards the rights of a very large number of people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The day has come when there must be a full revision of social services so that all sections of our community, the aged, the sick, the widowed and all the rest, receive <span class="highlight">justice</span> from this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The past has gone, and the present demands a new relationship between labour and capital, a relationship which can be made profitable for both by giving to each nothing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia needs a new government now - a government that can unite management and workers of this country, a government that can work with the people, not against them, for prosperity for all with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If productivity increases then the people who are responsible for that productivity increase ought to share in it, and many of the people who have made this possible over the last 22 years are now dependent upon the Government for <span class="highlight">justice</span> which they are not getting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several prominent citizens, including members of the clergy and the judiciary, took part in establishing a completely new movement to demand <span class="highlight">justice</span> for pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a new, heart-rending philosophy at all; it is the hard facts of political life which have forced the Government to look towards <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But several eminent economists have shown that it is necessary, if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be done and if the wealth is to be fairly distributed, that wages increase at  a  faster rate than productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that any increase to be given in the Budget would do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister carefully deviated from the contents of the Bill and directed his remarks to attacking the workers and their trade unions for their activities in trying to gain wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and improved working conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pensioners do not ask merely for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for themselves; they ask also for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the other underprivileged persons in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another injustice in the Social Services Act is the lack of the right of appeal in the case of an applicant for an invalid pension who is rejected on the say-so of one doctor who goes completely by the book in relation to the 85 per cent incapacity provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No applicant should be refused a pension on the say-so of one doctor, lt is only common <span class="highlight">justice</span> to allow an appeal in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was leading to the point where I was about to say that there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The representations have been dragging on for about 3 years and still the people whom I represent have received no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, lt is about time the Government got down to looking at this case and started negotiating to give satisfaction to the people employed at Seymour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To lessen the time and percentage factors would lessen the cost and shocks suffered by leaseholders on reap.praisement but it would also retain the problem, by pushing the crunch further into the future, by perpetrating the anomalies, and by delaying <span class="highlight">justice</span> to leaseholders and the Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The author of this pamphlet, who would be well known to many honourable members in this House, is no less a responsible person than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope describes that law and describes how traffic offences are used, and the question of rights in respect of the distribution of leaflets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy SpeakerBefore the suspension of the sitting I was pointing out how that very responsible writer on matters of this sort,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the New South Wales Supreme Court, had stressed the great need to put a balancing element into legislation of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said by no less a person than Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren that this State law was merely a weapon let loose with devastatingly destructive power for the infringement of freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren said: ‘This is ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of them is now a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite his reputation for probity and integrity - as to which the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> testified and I have no doubt that be has this general reputation - I am quite sure that a lot of his evidence before me was a pack of lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see that the concepts in which we face questions of law and administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> are completely different from those of the people opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is part of the strength of the community that in fact most of us are not inflicted with injustices all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the tributes to our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that over the centuries there has been a consistent effort by people administering the law - judges in the courts, even attorneys-general and people conservative and non conservative - to attempt to make sure that the law shall presume that a person is innocent until proved guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we ought not to pass in this House any legislation which confers upon a single man, whether it be a judge, a magistrate or a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, the right to gaol another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 broad categories to which I have referred all appear to be excluded from the scheme at the moment, lt is because of the difficulties of ensuring that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to all people that 1 am not sure at this stage whether those people would not be better covered by the general financial assistance which is now under consideration through either the Rural Loans Insurance Corporation, the rural reconstruction scheme or some other system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commission, (c) Australia has not first sought, as required by the United Nations Charter,  all  possible peaceful means of settlement which include asking  all  powers involved to sign the Accords and to petition and submit all matters in dispute to the determinations of the International Control Commission, the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and United Nations instrumentalities and (d) there are reasonable grounds for presumptions that the Thieu Government came to power in Saigon due to massive foreign aid and maintains power by corrupt procedures and the Lon Nol faction threatened certain key members of the Cambodian Parliament to obtain a near unanimous vote ousting Sihanouk to offset his increasing international support, will he publish refutations in answer to these claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-50-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any Bill, whether it is aimed at trade unionists, at any member of the public or, as in the case of this Bill, at rural industry, incurs my displeasure if that facet of <span class="highlight">justice</span> does not even appear to be provided for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, notwithstanding precautionary measures, injury or damage is done to the representative of another country, to the premises he occupies, the host state falls under a secondary duty to do its utmost to identify the offender and bring him to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it is contrary to one of the basic principles of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> for an accused person not to be given full particulars of the charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I say that this legislataion can lead only to confrontation between the public and the law, to a misuse of authority and to the creation of a lack of respect for law and government by those who recognise the lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> when an Act is administered in an unjust way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An accused person is entitled and should in all common fairness and natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> be entitled to full particulars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a law and order Bill which is concerned very little indeed with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a term which Government supporters speaking in support of the Bill have used very little because, indeed, there is very little <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they wanted to demonstrate against the war in Vietnam or against visitors from a country which supported apartheid or if they wanted to support farmers who were seeking economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> or old age pensioners they had no freedom of assembly and no freedom of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the evidence 1 have from visiting courts of law and watching the results, particularly in the lower courts, I believe that there is no possibility of <span class="highlight">justice</span> of any sort flowing from language such as this or a law such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases these people have either had a prohibitive bail fixed by the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace or the magistrate or been discharged when, in the end, the term of imprisonment for the offence is challenged before a higher court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should place upon magistrates courts, justices of the peace or any other body of that type the requirement to make the kind of judgment that the AttorneyGeneral is asking them to make in this instance, particularly in an area of public controversy such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it puts the onus on the magistrate who is hearing the charge in a lower court of this country, tf the AttorneyGeneral tells me that there is any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the lower courts of this country, then I will agree with what the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  said a moment ago, that the Attorney-General has never stood in a lower court in this country for a great many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one can deduce that there is little or no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the lower courts and that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> only in the higher courts, one may add the rider that if one has sufficient finance one can avail oneself of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> which may or may not exist iri the higher courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of this clause includes this heartening evidence of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of honourable members opposite: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that in a lower court where only a magistrate or a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace is sitting, he should not be able to impose prison sentences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to be legalistic about this but it is from two of the greatest jurists this country has ever produced,  Sir Owen  Dixon and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt, as he then was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is  Sir Owen  Dixon and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt-  we should have thought that to find an answer it was necessary to look for the substantial elements common to the recognised forms of procedure so called and going to make up the conception of prosecution upon indictment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are we not receiving answers from all the people who must accept the responsibility for this serious departure from the general principles from <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask this: Are we taking into the new era, as it is called, those things that really matter to the older people in this community - <span class="highlight">justice</span>, service, self-sacrifice and Christianity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will know that the matter is before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Restrictive Trade Practices Court in that country judgment was banded down by the  President, Sir Stanford  Cooper,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Buckley,  Mr W.  L. Heywood and  Mr D.  V. House after the court had considered the matter from June until October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives cannot be paid at the same salary level as his counterparts in the Commonwealth Public Service, what chance has the parliamentary attendant to obtain salary <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will know that the stewards are considering their position in talks with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that in 1957  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, in giving judgment in the High Court in the Lunny and Hayley cases, severely criticised section 51 of the Act and said that if he were to be directed to review the section be would have misgivings about what conclusion he would reach? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan, in a dissenting judgment in the same case, indicated he could not find anything that would indicate that in the rate of wages being paid the appellants there was any consideration of the expense incurred in travelling to and from work, does the Government propose to do anything about reviewing this hardship through an amendment of section 51 of the Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> imply that the section should be reviewed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has been particularly anxious to divorce the legal aspect from the moral problem and the problems associated with <span class="highlight">justice</span> and reasonable treatment of Australian Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise to everyone, including the 3 left wing unions, that we should not confuse the legal approach, the moral approach and an approach based on <span class="highlight">justice</span> for Australian Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When does the Attorney-General expect to receive a report from the Administrative Review Committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr which he appointed in September 1968 to deal with matters which could come within the purview of the proposed Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the lapse of time and any question of urgency associated with the matter, I would point out that when the proposal was suggested originally the list in the High Court, particularly in single <span class="highlight">Justice</span> matters, was very greatly in arrears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the administration of the current Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> this position has been altered rather dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not conscious that the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr has been appointed to inquire into Service pay and conditions has in any way delayed, this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that sounds like an equitable arrangement or anything approaching <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it could have fooled me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In May 1970, under the Chairmanship of a  Deputy President  of the Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, the employers, the ACTU and the Waterside Workers’ Federation reached agreement on a number of matters which were awarded by consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most recent major concessions were made in May 1970 when the parties were before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to other conditions of employment not covered by the agreement reached before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore the Waterside Workers Federation gave an undertaking that it would progress all claims with the employers through established procedures and take all reasonable steps to ensure that work continued normally while these negotiations were in progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the ACTU and the federal officers of the Federation have done their utmost to ensure that the undertakings which they gave in the proceedings before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore were honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the Bill which gives effect to the report of the Inquiry into Academic Salaries by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston following the increase of 6 per cent granted by the national wage case decision in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>They have not been tied automatically to Commonwealth and State increases in university salaries as they occur every 3, 4 or 5 years, as from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston or anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within 24 hours of my revealing this information in Parliament the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department moved Mullen from Berrima Gaol to Newnes farm which, in fairness to the New South Wales authorities, I must say is probably the best prison in New South Wales apart from Silverwater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 18th April 1968 the former Minister for Health,  Dr Forbes,  announced the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo’s Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance and on 25th March 1969 that Committee’s report was tabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it designed to give the Aboriginal people a greater sense of belonging, a greater sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or a greater sense of possession? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  I hope that in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people and to democracy that the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Opposition will be carried because no justification exists for the proposals incorporated in the Prime Minister’s statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> to honourable members opposite, I would imagine that more than  Si  of them will wish to speak on this legislation because the position of people in the rural sector is more serious now than it has been for 40 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him support the Opposition in what is a fight for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and democracy against suppression in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concentration of attention was happily, hypocritically, safely and selfrighteously on those who broke the law, skilfully skirting the question of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the laws being imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  that nowhere is the dangerous potential of non-indigenous institutions and laws more apparent than in such matters as land tenure and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave us a system that worked better than it had ever worked since the days of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore on page 66 of his reasons for judgment pointed out that the previous statement of the Commission that increases in prices are determined by those who fix prices is a truth that cannot be emphasised enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is meant, as I see it, to provide a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people in the rural community and to a certain extent to help some farmers to obtain a more viable status for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me the Bill represents a genuine attempt to provide social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a group of people who, because of a fall in land values, probably have lost most if not all of their life investment or life savings and who, while they are on their properties, I understand, are not eligible for social service benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What success have the Commonwealth and Victoria police had in bringing to <span class="highlight">justice</span> the person or persons who bombed the Consulate-General of Yugoslavia in Melbourne on 21st October 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, after  Sir Garfield  became Chief: <span class="highlight">Justice</span> - and there were people who said at the time that this was a great loss to the cause of banning restrictive practices, because it was thought that the best poachers often proved to be the best gamekeepers - the next AttorneyGeneral, the present ; Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  brought in a trade practices Bill which had no reference to vertical resale price maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was giving honourable gentlemen on the Government side the opportunity to carry out their Leader’s, promise to the people and to carry out the promises delivered at many learned and commercial gatherings by the former AttorneyGeneral, who is the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that this is not just a matter of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and conditions; it is a matter of the health and efficiency of every person concerned with the Parliament, including the drivers who are waiting outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to quote, if I may, an extract from the report of that Commission, which was delivered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse, an eminent member of the Supreme Court of New Zealand whom I have the privilege of knowing very well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse told me only a few weeks ago that, since the report was brought down in 1967, the intention of the Commission was that the new rate should be related to the cost of living index at the present time compared with what it was when it recommended a maximum of $120 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr Chief  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Nixon, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGrath, spoke about the co-ordination of these Acts before the Industrial Relations Society of New South Wales and it was there that he suggested uniform legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For heaven’s sake, if we are to spend millions on such exercises, let us apply some kind of system of equality of expenditure and effort and some kind of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has refused to lift the restriction order to enable Sobukwe to leave Kimberley and hence South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Sobukwe  has given notice of intention to bring an action in the Supreme Court to compel the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to lift the order restricting him to Kimberley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, then, did the right honourable gentleman at a dinner of his old school on Friday 30th July at which he was guest of honour - the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and a couple  of hundred other distinguished citizens were present - volunteer the statement that there was no truth in reports that the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did so because we thought social <span class="highlight">justice</span> demanded a rise to offset the sharp increase in living costs which was causing unexpected hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always apprehended as one of the most fundamental principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we hear the other side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Government’s policy of ensuring the <span class="highlight">justice</span> and adequacy of financial and other conditions of service of the armed Services, this Committee was set up in October 1970 under the chairmanship of the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  John R. Kerr, C.M.G., a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, with other distinguished members having experience of the armed forces, conciliation and arbitration, commerce and industry and the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee suggested that these reviews might not be limited to fixed intervals but made as necessary to maintain comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the light of general wage movements in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity of commending the excellent work which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr and his Committee have carried out to the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee which was appointed under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr acted promptly, I think efficiently, and certainly very comprehensively in relation to the matters it was asked to investigate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To add to this recent insult is the trial of Sheik Mujibur Rahman which I hope all honourable members will agree is a gross outrage and a violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These included <span class="highlight">justice</span> for those undertaking the military service, the relevant constitutional requirements and the relevant ILO conventions which have been ratified by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has subverted our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that on that occasion some of the most basic principles concerning the enforcement and administration of law, order and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia were subverted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these principles - I venture to suggest that there is no principle more basic than this in the administration of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia or, indeed, in any civilised society - is that judges and persons holding judicial positions should be free of the fear of being removed by any government of any particular political complexion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it goes quite contrary to the elementary and basic principles of the administration of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again goes contrary to one of the most elementary principles of the administration of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>: That judges should not be criticised; that judges should have arguments addressed to them in court; that they should not be threatened with blackmail, because that is what this amounts to; that they should not be threatened that if they do not behave themselves attempts will be made to remove them from the bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again is another very basic principle of the administration of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in any civilised society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One finds a complete attack on the whole established system of the administration of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, from those examples that I have quoted - and indeed there are many others which one could quote - what some members of the Labor Party have done is to subvert those very basic principles of the administration of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should not need to persuade honourable members that the preservation of the liberty of the subject is a vital brick on which our whole system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present New South Wales Board is made up of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Allen, a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; Judge Levine of the District Court; Miss Margaret Telfer, Registrar of the University of Sydney;  Mr Ramsay,  a retired former Under-Secretary of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>;  Mr J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a decision has been made, a prisoner can have no valid reason in those circumstances to suppose that he has not had a fair go or that he has not had fair treatment because <span class="highlight">justice</span> has manifestly been seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> must be done and must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No prisoner who is refused parole will believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done to him or that he has had a fair go when he knows that the decision on whether he would be released was in the hands of people whom he does not know, who probably are unknowable to him and whose decisions he cannot influence, but who in his mind are associated with Crown prosecutors and police prosecutors who helped to put him in gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunities for abuse and, more importantly, a feeling of injustice on the part of the prisoner, are obvious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, under the old system in New South Wales, a parole board could consider only cases referred to it by the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I wish to make, that the judicial standards should be aimed at, has been made abundantly clear in the speech of the New South Wales Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Maddison,  during the second reading of the New South Wales legislation introduced in 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without legal training one has to depend largely on the advice of experts, but as one opinion offset the other I decided that it was not in the best interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that I vote on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am talking about <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the community <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to see eventuate out of my case is a little bit of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to counter the inflationary trends that this Government has inflicted upon the people of Australia in the last 22 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  was good enough to quote what the Phillipines Foreign Secretary sent to me a week or so ago, but in the Philippines I also had conversations with  President  Marcos - as I always do when I visit that country - with Executive Secretary Melchor and the Secretaries for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, Labour and Finance and various persons in business and industry in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the tedium and the seeming lack of positive success of the operation eroded that support, in conjunction of course with a massive and successful propaganda campaign directed towards undermining public belief in the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not point out that in the fifth month there was a prolonged stoppage of building workers in New South Wales, not primarily over an inflationary wage demand but over a claim for higher workers’ compensation, and that a State tribunal later acknowledged the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can now be no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, <span class="highlight">justice</span> which will give dignity to pensioners, until we get away from the cash handout tied to Budget expediency that characterises the Liberal Government’s attitude to pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is absurd to believe that the kind of economic juggling contained in an annual Budget like this one can be an effective instrument for either efficiency or <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are often utilised and varied for causes of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and welfare, but they are pre-eminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On another occasion I quoted in this House the opinion of three of the judges of the Arbitration Commission,  Sir Richard  Kirby,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore as expressed in the 1968 national wage case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had all hoped that a solution was in sight, that some formal attempt would be made to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the pensioner and the superannuitant by ceasing to use the pension system as a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest they should fix their own incomes any more than we in Parliament should, for it is not only that <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be done but that it should also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us be decisive about this festering sore of injustice and forget Party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a system of seeing that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done it is mediaeval and ancient and should be done away with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This just is not <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is a deliberate attempt to bring about a pool of unemployment and to incite competition among job seekers, such as occurred in the 1930s, just for the purpose of trying to weaken the activities and the support of the unions in their attempts to obtain and retain proper conditions and wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> for their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is strong Government criticism of the members of the Commonwealth Conciliation^ and Arbitration Commission and the employers’ who were convinced of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the union claims and gave them proper recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of economic policy, the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court  Sir Owen  Dixon, in 1953 used words of such clarity and wisdom that they would have put the Commission’s role beyond question 1 would have thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely also they make it clear that the courts, in making a decision, are quite satisfied that, irrespective of economic consequences, they could not if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be done grant a lesser increase in wages than they believe to be warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these restrictions are not imposed and if prices and profits continue to increase as they will, then despite what this Government and the Australian Council of Employer Federations want to enforce, the workers of this country are justly entitled to seek and be granted increases in their pay packets, and any attempts to deny them that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be strongly opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that men cause wage increases, and men cause price increases - the former in search of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and dignity for themselves and their families and the latter in search of dominance and privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the people without power, the people whose faces reflect the many aspects of poverty, are urged to exercise restraint, and are castigated if they demand wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the Government and the big corporations gain more revenue for the one and increased profits for the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, the fact that the people of mainland China recognise Taiwan as a province of China and that the Taiwanese regime recognises Taiwan also as a province of China does not lead us inexorably to the proposition that Taiwan, therefore, in all law, sense and <span class="highlight">justice</span> is a province of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary in the interests of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory that this Bill be passed as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier in his speech he announced the setting up of the independent arbitrator to decide a battle between the marketers, the people who are bringing in low priced petrol and giving it to motorists at 4c or Se  a  gallon lower than the major oil companies have been giving it to them - an independent arbitrator to see whether they can get a little bit of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the major refining interests in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> made the crushing comment on his successor’s Bill that the Trade Practices Act 1965, in his opinion, was wholly invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the same field we have had reports by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s committee - the Company Law Advisory Committee to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The learned Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> referred to the Act being wholly invalid, but he was directing his attention specifically to section 35. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is poetic <span class="highlight">justice</span> indeed that the man who first raised the question of trade practices and rackets was there as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia to make sure that economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be done for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here I would like to con: gratulate the Government - on having done <span class="highlight">justice</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On sheer grounds of social equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, therefore, the Government cannot allow economic conditions to persist in which union militancy will pay off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the publication Australian Industrial Laws (Fourth Edition) which describes  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy’s finding as ironic, pointing out that had the company not erroneously refused to pay the claim in the first instance there would have been no occasion for the so-called impertinence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also think that in contemplating this question we have to consider not only the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the claim but also the current economic climate and the Government’s austerity programme as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is always seeking some new approach to their problems and is constantly working hard for greater social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, to do him <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that he personally believes that the means test is immoral, unjust and uneconomic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite obvious that if we want to see <span class="highlight">justice</span> done to social service recipients it is necessary to arrive at proper amounts and proper guidelines for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we know that a policy attributed to concepts of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> can only be administered where there is a significant and adequate rate of economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has neglected the economic analysis, with a fair assessment of how appropriate social welfare is to social <span class="highlight">justice</span> within the context of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants someone from the judiciary, someone of the calibre of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr who is conducting the inquiry into Service pay and conditions, then obviously it may have to wait months or even years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that they put forward an equitable case for a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> from this Government but their representations have been completely ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have moved an amendment in those terms on previous occasions and we have moved other amendments in this place during repatriation debates in the time that I have been here, each time trying to get better <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the exservicemen and women of Australia than the Government is prepared to give them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that  Dr Delamothe,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Queensland, has made some comment in relation to the use of the mails for the transfer of pornographic literature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Delamothe  indicated that the matter had been discussed at a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers - I presume, the Attorneys-General and Ministers for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> - and that he would bring the matter up again at their next meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister, as I have done before, to what I regard as an injustice in this field, that is, requiring a full licence fee even for a set which is located beyond the limits of the area which the Department considers can be effectively served by a television station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This morning I learnt to my complete astonishment that the union representatives had informed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki that they did not agree that settlement had been reached and that they were instructing the radio operators, on the return of their ships to port, to leave the ships once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I express my very strong personal appreciation of the action that the Government has taken, firstly, as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity to superannuated and retired officers, and secondly, from the point of view of the morale of those present Commonwealth officers who are nearing retirement and whose financial outlook in the future would have been somewhat bleak if it had not been for the proposals contained in these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr is at present  chairman  of a 5-man committee that the Government has appointed to inquire into pay and other conditions of service of members of the armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be obvious to anybody that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With strong unions knowing that there is so much further to go before they get wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a fairer share of the cake for their members; with so many large impregnable international companies; with institutions, financial and others, which are vastly different from what they were 30 years ago; with the growth of hire purchase and other similar forms of term lending and with savings in arrears; is it any wonder that these behaviour patterns are different? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Institute indicative planning and programmed budgeting for economic growth and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the Commonwealth, in co-operation with the States, local authorities and organisations of employees and employers; this planning to be consistent with the maintenance of full employment and the conservation of natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no time to talk further about the injustice and inequity of this Liberal-Country Party Government allowing exorbitant profits to be earned by so many companies in our community, particularly finance companies, and which then has the hide to blame inflation on the workers of this country in the lower income groups because those workers seek wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or by other means at their disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could it not be that because of the attitude of governments throughout Australia today those men have lost patience with the arbitration system and have had to take this type of action in order to get wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because they could not get <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the place in which they were supposed to get it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that our laws could be framed in such a way as to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and not only appears to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He says that war - by contrast with selfsacrifice, loving one’s enemies and forgiveness - can be justified when it is fought to maintain <span class="highlight">justice</span> and right, and only in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The object of war is to vindicate undoubted <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder what has happened to freedom, democracy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia, when we have twenty-year-olds being made staves, killers and dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we are to see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bass  (Mr Barnard),  it is right that the House for once should listen to the words of a young man affected by this legislation, to listen to the protests of one man who has been forced, against his will, into the situation which this amendment seeks to correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article states that  Mr Maddison,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in New South Wales, when replying to  Mr Petersen,  the State member for Illawarra, said that there were reasons for Mullen being transferred from Berrima gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state - and I want the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  to take note of this - that the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Maddison,  that it became obvious that this man Mullen was unable to relate to other inmates in the institution and that he was in danger of suffering physical violence is categorically false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am satisfied from information I have received from the New South Wales Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> that the decision to move  Mr Mullen  to Cooma was made in  Mr Mullen’s  own interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had to be prompted in this respect because it was not the Government that decided of its own volition to set up the committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr which is now examining conditions in our armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Corangamite asked why the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition mentioned the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr into Service pay rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition mentioned the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Kerr inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Would this be the case with the system proposed in the amendment and would it not amount to a virtual denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> if a man was not enabled to have the witnesses he wanted properly heard in person? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have described it as a retribution, a pay back, a threat, a form of blackmail or, if you like, revenge, lt goes against every principle that is ever enacted in any court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is merely a question of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a provision in an Act which prevents the normal parole provisions which apply to any other citizen from being applied to people convicted under the National Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking the Government to do, in the ordinary course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, is to amend the National Service Act to allow not only remissions for good behaviour but also the normal parole provisions to be extended to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or logic in this kind of attitude? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for Labour and National Service, who is responsible for this Bill, will reconsider the proposition put by the honourable member for Corangamite and accept an amendment which ought to be accepted on the basis of common humanity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there is a concentration of thought and better longrange planning on this matter of accommodation for members, staff and the ancillary services of the Parliament we will not be doing ourselves <span class="highlight">justice</span> and will not have a properly functioning Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to inform the House that the Government decided to invite the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  P. B. Toose, C.B.E., of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to conduct the inquiry and that he has accepted this invitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is fortunate to secure the services of this distinguished gentleman and I wish to record my appreciation of the action of the New South Wales Government which has agreed to make  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has a wide legal and Army background and is eminently suited to the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had a distinguished career at the Bar which culminated in his appointment to the Supreme Court Bench, firstly as an acting <span class="highlight">justice</span> in 1966 to 1967 and subsequently to a permanent appointment in June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to his war service,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose served throughout the 1939-45 war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose will be well received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Government wanted a senior judge; I belive that it is fortunate in getting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to conduct the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having stressed this point I make no criticism of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is then intended that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose should collate these views and include them in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr will follow a similar line in his inquiry into Parliamentary pay rates and allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose will not be able to express himself on proper levels of pension payments and other benefits for ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the areas which should be looked at closely by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose is the impact of Vietnam on the whole structure of the Repatriation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one particular and important area which I hope will receive special attention from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have been critical of that important aspect of the terms of reference which denies a qualified person the right to assess pension rates and the extent to which their values have been eroded - if it can be successfully argued that they have been eroded, and I believe it can - I think it is competent for a man of the calibre of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, with the evidence that will be placed before him, to be able to recommend to the Government what he believes ought to be the schedules of repatriation benefits and how those schedules should be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made that criticism I again acknowledge that the terms of reference will at least provide to those organisations and persons interested, particularly the Returned Services League, members of this Parliament and others, the opportunity to place their views before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in relation to the many other matters that have been raised in this Parliament and which 1 believe would improve the existing Repatriation Act and remove some of the anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has to skip from one department to the other and in doing so one cannot do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to any of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we like to think of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this case, those who are not responsible - the trade union members themselves - will pay the penalty, not the powerful associates of the members of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gross injustice would be involved here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are relatively unsophisticated, as compared with the procedures in the Supreme Court, but are reasonably well suited to the purpose of achieving <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the parties where the amount in dispute is small and where more thorough and expensive procedures are unwarranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that committee was under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr and its members included such eminent people as the Solicitor-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Professor Whitmore of the Australian National University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sake of appearance and for the sake of <span class="highlight">justice</span> appearing to be done, the police should, in their own interests, be taken out of these courts because they are criticised for being there in these roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a whole area in which it can be said that a person fighting a civilian case in these courts suffers from the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> given to him as of necessity because of the rules or because of the lack of rules compared to what that person might get if he went to the supreme court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it is said - the Minister himself has said it: ‘You are not fighting over a very large sum of money; is it not better to have summary <span class="highlight">justice</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Summary <span class="highlight">justice</span> is often not very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on the pure issue of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a country where education is compulsory no-one can deny the right of a parent to send his child to the school of his choice provided that the standard of education is met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only a question of <span class="highlight">justice</span>; it is a question of pure economics and the advancement of education in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education should promote love of freedom and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and should develop critical perception, ability to choose intelligently, capacity for selfgovernment and a sense of social responsibility, lt should instil belief in the equal rights of all people and respect for their essential humanity, irrespective of nationality, colour or creed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of New South Wales is inquiring into the problems of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The supposition that there is discrimination between Aborigines and whites in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been tested by several academics and by the Opposition’s Aboriginal Affairs Committee, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that in many parts of Australia Aboriginal people are being discriminated against as far as <span class="highlight">justice</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overwhelming evidence exists, even with the limited studies that have been done, that in every State, with the exception of Tasmania where we disposed of our Aboriginal community many, many years ago by most unbecoming techniques and methods, Aboriginal people are receiving the kind of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which has prompted the Minister to call for an inquiry in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Committee were:  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, a member of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, as Chairman;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason, who was first appointed to the Committee in his capacity at the time as the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth and who continued to be a member of the Committee following his appointment in 1969 as a Judge of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales;  Mr R.  J. Ellicott, Q.C., who joined the Committee on his appointment as SolicitorGeneral of the Commonwealth on 15th May 1969; and Professor J. Whitmore, presently Dean of the Faculty of Law in the Australian National University and an acknowledged authority on administrative law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, I suppose we should reassure honourable members, in view of the number and the intensity of their attendance and interests, that this is not the other report which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr is preparing, nor can - we expect–that it will be acted upon as rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a blatant miscarriage of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if there is any economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country the payment of a one year emergency cash grant with no strings attached should be made to those producers who need it most providing - I stress this - that there is some direction from the Government regarding reconstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some, through private wealth or other resources, will not be in nearly as much need of it as the majority of wool growers will be, but once we begin to impose arbitrary restrictions, means tests and requirements of proof of poverty before payment is made then, firstly, we fail completely to recognise the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of providing this measure of protection to the wool industry, and secondly, we create humiliating unreasonable and unfair conditions for this section of Australian producers which conditions do not apply to all sections of producers in the secondary division of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that it is possible that this may cut costs of litigation but in many cases it would cut out a good deal of <span class="highlight">justice</span> because in litigation, and particularly in defamation actions, as I have found from personal experience, juries are more human and understanding than the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote from the text of the judgment in the case Lunney v.

  <li>
    <p>Times have changed; the incidence of income tax greatly differs now in scope and weight from its incidence in the days when the law was more settled; possibly, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the traditional legal view is a little more open to question and certainly its financial significance supplies a motive for questioning it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 27th December 1967  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher and Commissioner Winter in a joint statement from the bench rebuked the then Treasurer for his attack upon the Commissioner’s decision in granting pay rises in the 1967 metal trades case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon said, a man would need remarkable foresight, when he lodged his original log of claims, to be able to see in 10 years time that there was going to be a demarcation dispute in one of the factories in one of the States and unless one can do that then one is out of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is prepared to subsidise the wool industry or, should I say, a particular group of people in the wool industry who do not need assistance and who can strain at a gnat and swallow a camel, yet it denies these people elementary fiscal and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely if there is any semblance of compassion left in this so-called Liberal Government at least it ought to extend some sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity to the physically, mentally and socially handicapped, including the quadriplegic, the paraplegic and the epileptic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In dealing with -the Estimates for the Department of Social Services and the Repatriaton Department I wish first of all to deal with an individual case, because I think it exemplifies the lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which has been provided in this current Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way to correct this injustice is to review policy fully right across the board in respect of social services, as I shall explain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is so, will the Minister say whether this is still another example of how the Government dispenses <span class="highlight">justice</span> to some pensioners and whether it is similar to the penalties imposed on some people by the Postmaster-General’s Department in its application of fringe benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plain fact is that if the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Moreton accept our propositions, if they believe that in common <span class="highlight">justice</span> this country can now afford to extend the benefits of the war service homes legislation to all those who serve in the armed Services in this country, as we did for those who served during the 1939-45 war, and as we did again after the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer those who wish to check this method of fixing rentals to page 22 of the transcript of a judgement given earlier this year by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright in the case of Henrich v.

    <p>Where is the equality or <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the case earlier this year of Henrich versus Dunsford in South Australia and to the judgment of the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the finding by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright which is in keeping with the findings of the Tasmanian Select Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely after the comments made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright and the report by the Tasmanian Select committee, an inquiry of this Parliament s’-ould be held, particularly in relation to valuations and rentals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Institute indicative planning and programmed budgeting for economic growth and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the Commonwealth, in co-operation with the States, local authorities and organisations of employees and employers; this planning to be consistent with the maintenance of full employment and the conservation of natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this legislation that we are now refining was contemplated its architect was  Sir Garfield  Barwick, now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in Australia the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, first introduced quite a progressive and completely definitive set of proposals in the early 1960s which were submitted to this House in 1962 by a former minister on behalf of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is poetic <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> sat in judgment on this Act and provided the constitutional basis on which a Labor government will be able to return any new legislation to his original proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in short, the judgment is a victory for Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick and for Professor Richardson and a slap in the face to those who, over many years, have used the celebrated section 92 of the Constitution as an  instrument of constitutional subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals were prepared in an exhaustive manner by one of the best legal brains the country has produced -  Sir Garfield  Barwick, now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and I repeat that the Government should be ashamed for its obtuseness and its obmutescence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party seeks close and continuing co-operation with the people of the United States and New Zealand to make the ANZUS Treaty an instrument for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and peace and political, social and economic advancement in the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the same occasion I pointed out that the ANZUS Treaty refers not only to peace but also, in its very first article, to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, earlier this year the Government of Fiji inquired of the Australian Government whether an Australian judge could be made available to succeed the retiring Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji,  Sir Clifford  Hammett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with pleasure that in introducing the present Bill I am able to announce that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  John Angus Nimmo, a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, has agreed to accept appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji, and subject to the passing by the Parliament of Fiji of enabling legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Nimmo has had wide and distinguished judicial experience in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure too that honourable members will be pleased that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo has accepted the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present case, therefore,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo will continue to hold office as a judge of the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now before the House has therefore the short purpose of excluding the application of sub-section (2) of section 103a of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo’s appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We applaud  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo’s accepting the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo is a singularly well furnished judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo assisted with the AttorneyGeneral’s Department’s studies of the criminal code for the Territories, the results of which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when Attorney-General tabled in May 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances it is fortunate indeed that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo is a man who will be unspoiled by and indifferent to any colonial residues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All persons appearing before him or appealing to him can have the utmost confidence, as people in a variety of jurisdictions in Australia have had over many years, that he will not only dispense <span class="highlight">justice</span> but also see that everybody knows that it is being dispensed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is contrary to the rules of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and should not be tolerated in respect of any primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition believe that the principle is wrong and that the words ‘an averment or statement in the complaint, claim or declaration of the plaintiff , is evidence of the matter so averred or stated’ are contrary to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is what the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, made clear when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can judge the attitude of the Government from the performance of the present Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was Attorney-General in trying to stop the 2 justices of the High Court from giving and explicit decision in relation to the case that was before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer and  Sir Garfield  Barwick gave a decision or made a recommendation or suggestion - however we want to phrase it - but the point is that the Government tried to stop it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 when the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> gave its decision in the North Sea continental shelf case it laid down a rule, and this is part of the rationale of the decision, which I would have thought every person in this country who is interested in this matter would have viewed with very considerable alarm, lt was that the equidistant principle with respect to 2 nations fronting each other where there is an unbroken continental shelf is not a principle of customary international Jaw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members read the judgment of the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Owen  Dixon, they will find that his opening words were: This has been brought to settle rights and to determine henceforth as to where these matters lie.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins summarised the aims of conciliation and arbitration by saying:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has provided major problems for the system in endeavouring to provide wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> for workers in smaller unions which have not had this advantage in bargaining power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an arbitration system fails to dispense wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, employees have but one solution, and that is to strike, lt remains the only weapon that is left to the 4.5 million Australians who have nothing but their labour to sell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  really wants to know the cause of industrial tensions, let him consider what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Powers said when delivering judgment in the basic wage case in 1921. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this not the very thing that happened in the great depression of the 1930s when Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dethridge ordered a 20 per cent reduction in shearers’ rates when the then current award had another year or more to run? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in 1930 the Scullin Government sought to remove that provision from the Act in order to prevent Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dethridge from reducing the shearers’ rates on the grounds that the pastoral industry could not afford it and it was announced that the matter had been raised in and presented to the Parliament by means of a Bill, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dethridge said, in effect: T do not care what the Parliament does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins said in 191 1 : <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins once remarked on the fact that although in theory the Court had power to decrease wages as well as to increase them, every case he had ever handled had been to interfere by way of increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to strike is not merely a favour or a privilege but should be a legal right based upon natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> requires that the increase in wealth that results from the application of labour to raw materials be shared between labour and capital in fair proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an address which was given by Health Minister Munro of Canada in Montreal on 22nd May 1969 and in which he refers to statements made by  Mr John  Ingersoll, the Director of the United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department’s Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to the Committee on Drug Dependence of the National Academy of Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major legal difficulty encountered by officers of the Narcotics Bureau in bringing drug traffickers to <span class="highlight">justice</span> is the necessity to produce direct evidence that drugs seized have been imported into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I announced the terms of reference of the inquiry and announced the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, a Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and of the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to conduct it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr has now presented his report and the Government has considered what action should be taken as a consequence of his recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now come to the Government’s consideration of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s recommendation is that the basic salary for members of Parliament should move from $9,500 to $13,000  -  an increase of $3,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our opinion it imposes a quite unreasonable burden of responsibility on an accused which is contrary to the general principles of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to me a completely cumbersome and unjustifiable system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Abbot expressed this view in relation to a prosecution which rested on suspicion only: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is pertinent to remember that the accused had no right to legal representation, no right to hear evidence, no right to question witnesses, no right to call witnesses, indeed none of the rights of an accused in any British court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this was not <span class="highlight">justice</span> by any standard; it was the numbers game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are required to act justly and I therefore say deliberately, as a member of the Committee and having participated in its proceedings, that it was a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to allow a verdict duly reached to be reversed without any reason in law or in <span class="highlight">justice</span> which would in any court in the world be accepted as a reason to reopen a case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the minute left to me,  Mr Speaker,  I repeat that I hope we will never again receive a report from a privileges committee constituted such as this one is, but that as a result of the Prime Minister’s initiative a tribunal will be set up, with judicial powers and exercising all the ordinary rules of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to report to the Parliament on the case against the accused and to allow the Parliament then, as is its duty and its right, to make the final judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I close by saying that any judge or jury faced with this case and presented with the same evidence could not in true <span class="highlight">justice</span> bring down any other verdict than the verdict contained in the report before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I hope that every honourable member of this Parliament will be objective when voting on the amendment because if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be done it must bc done for all and not just for special people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own Party is committed to the proposition that procedures and privileges of parliaments, - we use the term in the plural because we think it should apply to State parliaments as well - and their committees should be adapted to contemporary standards of efficiency and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am here to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this motion gives <span class="highlight">justice</span> and is in the best interests of the dignity of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I think the honourable member does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to put it mildly, to both Federal and State Governments as I have shown by a couple of examples in relation to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have often quoted the view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mansfield of the British courts that an individual is entitled, if he wants to, to drive a coach and horses through the law, but the law is also entitled to block such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>For honourable members opposite to criticise men who strike for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, men who in many instances, by resorting to strike tactics, were responsible for many of the reforms which people in Australia enjoy today, does little credit to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr has made his decision the Government is to ask the AMA to be a good sport and to go along with the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Irrespective of whether there is any social mechanism or social <span class="highlight">justice</span> behind it or social engineering or anything of that son, it is old fashioned retribution and that surely is the basis for the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this late hour I appeal to the men on the other side of the House to have a little sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and see that, if people such as those in North Vietnam and South Vietnam have battled against the most tremendous odds which have ever been put against human beings, they have battled against those odds for some strong reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the work done by the committee of inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr into the fundamental conditions of service in the forces would have indicated the need for an explanation by the Minister for Defence of his attitude towards a regular volunteer army and even a comment in the White Paper on this aspect of volunteer forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise that the reduced rentals were to apply to conform with the judgment handed down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright and that the Commonwealth agreed that these proposals would apply also to those settlers who already had signed their leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply point out that if the reduced rentals are to apply also to those who have signed their leases in South Australia there is no reason why the same <span class="highlight">justice</span> in adjusting valuations and rentals cannot apply to settlers in Western Australia and Tasmania where the Commonwealth has an overriding authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my time has almost expired I make a plea for the soldier settlers in Tasmania and Western Australia and other soldier settlers in South Australia to be given the benefit of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this may be taken in a lighthearted fashion it rather reflects the false <span class="highlight">justice</span> of such conferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by some miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, Labor came to office later this year, on that committee there would be  4  Labor government members and from the then Opposition, which is now the Government, there would be  3  members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor’s appointment will assist in enabling civil cases to be heard by the Court without due delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Cunningham, with his usual masterly command of the English language, said in very effective terms that a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> had occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> we receive under the sort of welfare principles that the Government espouses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A big company with many subsidiaries - I think that Travel House of Australia has approximately 2 dozen subsidiaries throughout Australia - was forced to cancel a whole flight programme because of the utterances of a member of Parliament who was only seeking truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the unwary people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government made this commitment in the belief that it was supporting the establishment of a government in South Vietnam and that this action would give it a breathing space and an opportunity to consolidate its control and build up its support among the people by the wisdom of its rule and presumably by the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of its rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, if it is the policy of the Labor Party to introduce regulations to adjust farm production as it sees fit to meet what it considers to be international demand, surely this more than any other single act would force thousands of farmers to leave their land without any form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Labor Party is doing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the farmers of Australia because, to their credit, the ability of our farmers to be flexible, adaptable and to diversify has meant that they have been able to carry on far longer than farmers in any other advanced agricultural country without the need for the support provided by the measure which is being introduced now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Along with his recommendations for increased salaries,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr in his report tabled in Parliament on 8th December 1971 recommended that travelling allowances payable to members and to Ministers and office holders be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As part of his general review,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended that members of Parliament residing in the Australian Capital Territory should receive half the Canberra allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, I join in this revolt and ask that there be a new initiative by the Government to ensure that the 3 principles that have been requested are adopted as  a  matter of urgency and that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> and truth in labelling for the consumer and the housewife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before 1 go on to talk about strikes and strike action, let me quote from a comment made by the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this state of poverty that is causing workers to revolt and to use the weapon of strike action to win the <span class="highlight">justice</span> which the $16,000 a year Commissioners deny them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While these injustices exist you are merely hissing into the wind by blaming communists and union officials for industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Remove wage injustice and you will remove the real cause of industrial disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Need I remind the House that in 1970, in an address at a dinner held by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, he chose to rebuke the  President  of the Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, and in turn was promptly rebuked by him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr was an advocate, on one occasion he went along to the Commission on behalf of the Government and asked for a moderate increase, but he could not tell the Commission what was wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place it was designed to provide a framework for the equitable settlement of industrial disputes or potential disputes through conciliation, or failing that through arbitration; in the second to ensure, so far as it is possible to do so, comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> - a phrase used so glibly these days that people often tend to forget its real meaning - although I maintain that a ‘fair go’ is not a bad colloquial translation because equal pay for work of equal value is a vital principle of our system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what else did  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins say about conciliation and arbitration in 1904? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister is working on the theory that it is better to deny them a vote and be certain that the majority will not vote against him in preference to giving them democratic <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and a say in the election of their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that under the Liberal-Country Party Government it is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> or democracy that counts at this time but rather the fear of the effect of the vote of these young people on this worn out, tired and decadent tory administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That by 18 most young people are ready for these responsibilities and rights and would greatly profit by them as would the teaching authorities, the business community, the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall in earlier years one particular judge, I think it was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cantor, who prior to delivering an award relating to the mining industry said: ‘Well, I have to deliver my judgment in this case but I do not know the inside of a coal mine if I saw one.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright, presiding at the hearing, made rather pointed comments about the adoption of this particular tactic by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright suggested that this type of submission, in effect, placed the full onus on the Commission to fit in with Government economic policy with regard to prices, productivity and wages, without the Commission being privy to Government thinking about the desirable level of wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will refer to an article published in the issue of 20th October 1971 where, similarly,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird in relation to a flow-on case from the metal trades award heard in July and August of last year was trying to pin down the Government’s representative, a  Mr Marks,  Q.C, as to exactly what his submission was and how it compared with prior submissions by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If an example is to be set of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and wage pegging and what the Government would call stability, the top level should be made to set this example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposed $4,400 a year increase in the salary of conciliation commissioners cannot be regarded in anybody’s book as wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> when the same commissioners recently granted an increase of only $104 a year to the tradesmen of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why does not the Minister in his most honoured role as the Minister for Labour and National Service do something about wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I would like to mention in passing that the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr on parliamentary salaries was presented recently, and unfortunately it was used politically by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended a basic salary of $13,000 for members of this Parliament but the Government suggested that we should reduce this amount to $12,000 in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was referring to the fact that I had appeared before an inquiry appointed by this Government under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason into the fees of general practitioners in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who are struggling on the minimum wage or slightly more than the minimum wage are being strongly opposed by the Government in their attempts to obtain wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and it finally accepts an increase of $2 a week, but medical practitioners, who are not particularly hard up, are not opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most notable and outrageous instances of that was when the present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  who was then the Treasurer, openly attacked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby at a dinner given by the Metal Trades Employers Association in Sydney, and he was suitably rebuked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that this is the way that it must seem to many millions of people who only in recent days have been denied wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> by a decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which was influenced, I repeat, directly or indirectly by this Government and by the Minister who is in charge of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we in the Opposition want to see in this case is that in respect of these people, as well as all other workers in Australia, <span class="highlight">justice</span> must seem to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance it does not appear that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This then must mean that those members in the execution of their duties are expected to ensure on the one hand that the workers receive wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> while on the other hand the employers receive <span class="highlight">justice</span> in relation to production efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in these areas of inefficiency that the main discontent occurs, mainly because the management not only is inefficient in organising the proper operation of the business but also is incapable of recognising its own shortcomings in relation to general work conditions and wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and is incapable of entering into any worthwhile or effective negotiations with employees or the union concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Polites, at that time anyway, was the main voice for the Employers Federation, an organisation whose views carry considerable weight with the Liberal-Country Party Government; an organisation whose members subscribe very largely to Liberal and Country Party funds; an organisation which over the years has done everything within its power to depress workers’ wages and prevent improvement in conditions; an organisation which has acted as best it could to deny wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to workers in one industry, if such wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> could perhaps flow on to workers in another industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr Polites  was advocating was that if any wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> exists in this country by way of some democratic system it should be replaced by a system of absolute dictatorship, a dictatorship controlled by a Liberal Government in collaboration with the Employers Federation, which could stop any further progress by unions towards obtaining a better deal for their members and, in turn, obtaining a fairer share of profits resulting from greater efforts of workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of economic policy, the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Owen  Dixon in 1953 used words of such clarity and wisdom that they would have put the Commission’s role beyond question I would have thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this amendment means to me is that it is a direction from the Government to the Commission to cast out claims for wage increases unless it is placed in a position where it cannot possibly do so and, when that occurs, to make any increase as small as possible, in other words, it is asking the Commission to accept the full responsibility for any price increases which may follow wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> when in actual fact that responsibility lies fairly and squarely upon the Government to prevent unscrupulous retailers or manufacturers from charging unwarranted prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am reminded of the remarks of that eminent <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Isaac  Isaacs, who in 1917 said that the real raison d’etre of the arbitration power in the Constitution is not the mere decision between 2 contesting parties as to disputed industrial conditions, though that in itself is undoubtedly important, but the desirability, sometimes amounting to public necessity, that the community may be served uninterruptedly and not compelled, when threatened with deprivation of perhaps the essentials of existence, to look on helplessly while those whose function it is to supply them stop their work to quarrel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that judgment one sees clearly stated by the majority decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dunphy and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Morgan, with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> dissenting, that a rule of the union that gives a union executive power to expel a member for misconduct, when the executive is merely of the opinion that the person is guilty of misconduct, is an invalid rule because it is too vague, imprecise and uncertain as to its meaning, and therefore must be struck down and removed from the union rule book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another collection of cases has been prepared by a very distinguished New South Wales judge, the late Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Jordan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not satisfied with a miserable increase given in the national wage cas: that had no relevance at all to the increase in the cost of living, the Government now proposes to ensure that in the future wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say literally ‘wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>’, because what is given in the future will depend on the whim and caprice of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original concept of the public interest i” our conciliation and arbitration system was expounded by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs in 1917. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs are just as true today as when they were originally said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> not only needs to be done but needs to be done in such a way that every man, and woman in the community at large understands what is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright, presiding at the hearing, made rather pointed comments about the adoption of this particular tactic by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright suggested that this type of submission, in effect, placed the full onus on the Commission to fit in with Government economic policy with regard to prices, productivity and wages, without the Commission being privy to Government thinking about the desirable level of wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this judgment, which was part of the majority judgment,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1968 ‘National Wage Case’ hearing, the Commonwealth ignored the stricture of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wright and suggested that Government policy favoured a small but not a moderate or large increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listening to the debate tonight I am reminded of some words rather wisely spoken by a judge of the 19th century - I think it was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Byles - who said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever there was an illustration of the truth of the proposition spoken in the 19th century by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Byles it has been proved in this House tonight because we have heard members on the other side of the House, and I fully respect their views, speaking about the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an indication of this Government’s conception of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something new and has absolutely no justification if one is intending to apply any degree of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, in reference to another point made by the employers, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Foster expressed part dissent, and the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Raymond  Kelly and, of course,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy approved the insertion of the bans provisions in the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be better if we had a way to determine the sum on which a man, his wife and his children could live, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins introduced in the Harvester award in the first national basic wage decision, and then a margin for skill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps is the Commonwealth taking to introduce some elements of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and reason to this backward area of our social milieu? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Prime Minister’s text then quoted the views expressed by  Sir Percy  Spender, former  President  of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, at a meeting attended by many then Ministers in April 1969, and also the judgments of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick and <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Victor  Windeyer in the High Court in August 1969 in the case of Bonser v.

  <li>
    <p>This was made clear by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have put this suggestion informally to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Commonwealth Government took into account a view expressed 2 years ago by the Past  President  of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> - that apart from inland waters, sovereign rights over the seabed and natural resources of the continental shelf vested exclusively in the Commonwealth from low water mark outwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least  Sir Gerald  Fitzmaurice who for many years was the legal adviser to the British Foreign Office and now is  President  of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> takes the same view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister was quoting the words of  Sir Garfield  Barwick, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> continued: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> went on to say that he could not do otherwise than decide this point because it was part of his function, and he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government and the State governments have been working over a period of years towards a situation in which there is greater <span class="highlight">justice</span> than that in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> this situation should never be allowed to prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give consideration to having the divisor used in the formula cited in the NOPM award for calculating such officers’ personal allowances varied to afford equity and some semblance of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am astounded by this revelation, because what the Minister is saying is that his Government is quite prepared to deny <span class="highlight">justice</span> to some members of this community to gain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for some members who are owed <span class="highlight">justice</span> by another community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have such a cavalier attitude towards the rights of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the welfare of migrants or pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is better that some people get more than they deserve than that the great majority are denied <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Labor government would remove these injustices and anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure will provide a great measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party Bill were enacted it would stop these people from obtaining this <span class="highlight">justice</span> and ending their days as they so obviously wish to end them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government’s legislation will provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people who have made Australia their home and who have served Australia well, ft will be provided at no great cost to the Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great champions of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Opposition have just moved a motion which suggests that unless acquitted by the Priviliges Committee I am guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the great champions of <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the Opposition completely deny, before we start on debating the motion, the chance of a person (a) to be charged and (b) to be considered innocent until he is proved guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I repeat, the great champions of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Opposition are so concerned with upholding the law that they are not prepared to give an individual the opportunity to (a) be charged and (b) to be considered innocent until he is proved guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I refer the honourable member to the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cook in the case In re Building Workers’ Industrial Union of Australia, New South Wales Branch (1965) 65 Industrial Arbitration Reports New South Wales pages 474 to 489 in which he held that the obligation imposed by sub-section 3  a  applied only to the process of conciliation and not to those of arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have seen the injustice of the proposals being put forward at a time when low wage earners, particularly those in the low income group in the Public Service, are not receiving <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we rejected that proposal in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and as a contribution to the economy and the stability of nation, he said: ‘Unless I get the $34,650 I will not support the legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just say to the Government that it is nearly time that it woke up; it is nearly time that it gave wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to everyone in the community from the lowest to the highest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because of the fact that this Government has double standards so far as wage structures and wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a Government that we on this side of the House say is denying proper wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and wage fixation to those people in the Public Service who do not rely upon measures to ge through this Parliament to be given their salaries and wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bil] does not pay even some form of lip service to the fact that people are justified in receiving wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case, the Leader of the Opposition, very cleverly I thought, skirted around it and at the last moment introduced an amendment which does nothing other than to negative the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government considers that honourable members opposite should be given a further opportunity to grant salary <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this group of statutory officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this measure will be passed by this House; I believe that we will support it in this House, and support it quite strongly because it is only giving wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is with very deep regret that I have to inform the House of the death on 7th July of  Sir Owen  Dixon, a former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, at the age of 86. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1926 he became Acting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1929 was appointed a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court from 1952 until his retirement in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party wishes to be associated with the tribute that the Prime Minister has paid to the former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As counsel, as judge, as wartime administrator, as diplomatist and as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Owen  Dixon touched nothing that he did not adorn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had a long and varied career, reaching its zenith as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the recent oil strike in this country fuel was cut off to the community, some tens of thousands were thrown out of work and the jobs of hundreds of thousands were put in jeopardy because a small group of trade unionists in this country was prepared, against the interests of the great majority of the wage earners of Australia, to refuse to accept the interim decision which had been handed down by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and to down tools at the expense of their fellow unionists and at the expense of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That initiative was then followed by the initiative taken by  Mr Laurie  Short of the Federated Ironworkers Association, and finally the initiative taken by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the case was before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, he pointed out that the Commonwealth had at all times had power oh an application to the court to remove the tent and that the Commissioner of Police and the Minister admitted that the Commonwealth had this power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reaction of the Minister, apart from the completely unnecessary clashes which took place, has been to bring down a new ordinance - one which is unnecessary, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox pointed out, because of the already existing powers of the Commonwealth, but one in which significant changes in the law were made and made in a particular direction to which all parties represented on the Senate committee which examines regulations and ordinances have always taken exception, namely, the procedure set out in section 8c (1.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this point I should like to conclude by reading what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said in dealing with the challenge made to the legality of this Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that Commission in July,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore granted an interim wage increase to the men and made it clear that provided work continued under normal conditions the unions’ full claims would be heard and determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the men agreed with  Mr Short  and, following  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore’s initiatives the next day, went back to work on the same terms and conditions as those on which they went out on strike earlier in July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the censorship law, as at present applied by the Minister for Customs and Excise and the ordinary courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Canberra, considered inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The typical Australian today is, I profoundly believe, a man or woman who wants to believe that he or she lives in a society which is committed to achieving <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity and opportunity for all, not just for himself and his immediate family but for all his fellow citizens, and who believes that he can and does contribute to achieving such a society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the typical Australian cannot believe he is living in a society committed to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equal opportunity when he sees his national government content to have 100,000 and more of his fellow-citizens unemployed, when he sees one million of his fellow citizens living near or below the poverty line, when he sees the operation of one law for wage earners and another for price fixers, when he sees men of great wealth able to avoid, through tax dodges, paying millions of dollars, when he sees the Aboriginal community suffering from the world’s highest infant mortality rate, when he sees millions of dollars spent on a handful of the wealthiest schools in Australia while most State and parish schools are struggling to meet basic standards, when he sees a health system which costs the richest man scarcely half as much as the average man has to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In modern Australia the typical Australian looks to his governments to redress these injustices, not least because he knows that governments themselves have done so much to create them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And in modern Australia the government he increasingly looks to for leadership and <span class="highlight">justice</span> is the national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the time to start building Australia’s future on the basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, equality and national co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that kind of thing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a time when the Government is denying elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> to pensioners and to children in the form of child endowment, when it is denying responsibility for the system of education other than paltry, arbitrary subsidies given to the wealthy private schools and a time when it is denying proper responsibility for hospitalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should have some <span class="highlight">justice</span> and some equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a simple plea tonight for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and help and 1 ask the Minister to take the initiative to bring the States, the canners and the grower’s representatives together to take action on the money owing to men for the fruits of their labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth Government cannot do anything about it, at least the good offices of the Attorney-General should be directed to the lawmakers in New South Wales - to those administering <span class="highlight">justice</span> in New South Wales - to protect this widow of an exserviceman and to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his recent book, ‘Labour and Inflation’ Lord Balogh, economic adviser to Britain’s Wilson Government, points to an oft forgotten principle - that just as wage and salary earners as a whole are entitled to a fair share of the Gross National Product, it is equally important that there should be <span class="highlight">justice</span> between different categories of workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Asprey to inquire into and report on the overall tax structure within the Commonwealth’s jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do need to avoid any kind of approach which suggests that people who earn more should not get the benefit of those earnings because, in this country, tor purposes of productivity and for purposes of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, those who are considered to be worth more in salary should not be  reduced to one common mould after taxation, which I think is sometimes suggested by the Opposition and which 1 fear would happen should the Opposition become the government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not consider it equitable and I do not consider it <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether any honourable member opposite really knows what the reason was for the unionists refusing to accept the interim decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, in all fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, this should not be allowed to happen if it can possibly be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 refer to the well intentioned but utterly misguided fuzzing over of major issues by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore in his precipitous ambition to settle a symptom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  and the Government have tried to make much of the alleged tax concessions in the Budget and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness of them, but let us look at what has really been proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters blamed that situation on the unions, but the unionists were fighting for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a respectable wage to pay off expensive homes and land, to rear and educate their children and to ensure them a decent footing in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget will certainly achieve its aims of stimulating confidence, giving increased discretionary spending power to individuals and giving increased social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may be relied upon to do full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to their needs, as we have done before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party approach, as outlined in the Treasurer’s Budget Speech, is short-sighted, inadequate and has no philosophy of basie rights or <span class="highlight">justice</span> either for individuals or industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next matter I want to refer to concerns the provisions of the Act which relate to what might be deemed the rights of the individual against an injustice which could be perpetrated by a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case there has been a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a decision has been made contrary to the provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These give way to the election promises of correction of injustice and the remedy of anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express my approval of what the Government has done in giving this belated measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well thought out Budget; it is designed to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people; it is well balanced; it will inspire confidence; it will create the incentive to develop; it will assist unemployment; it will raise the standard of living and, above all, it will preserve the stability of our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the Treasurer the decision given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any section of this community deserves <span class="highlight">justice</span> with compassion it is the people who receive pensions and who in human terms have been responsible for the great development of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, they are an act of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the election will be in three or four weeks the Committee will not be able to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this important inquiry which concerns a Supreme Court building; it is not something to be trifled with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used that example and I quote it again as a parameter or a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote the remarks of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore from the transcript of the national wage case for 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore cannot possibly be refuted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Minister for Supply and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Garland)  that his heart might be touched and that he might carry to the Treasurer this message from those of us who believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality: We believe that blind people should be exempted from the tax imposed on certain items that they use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of thing that typifies this Government is that in the default of doing anything about the regulation of prices or solving the inflation problem, it goes into the courts and argues against the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of workers getting higher wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it means is that comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and conditions will spread and it is unreal and deceptive to talk about a selective approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Labor Party any real concern for equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the work force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The case came before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs, who is now on the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that, when the first application was made to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in relation to this matter,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, I think it was, said a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister yet studied the contents of the survey by the Police Bureau of Crime Statistics which, according to the New South Wales Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, reveals that there are areas of real poverty in and around the electorate of Shortland and elsewhere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may quote from the judgment of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to explain the reason for this proposed suspension of the Standing Orders, at page 117 he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said, it is not that the particular Ordinance is invalid; it is merely that the form of promulgating, the form of notification, has been wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the very day on which the Lord Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, of England, Lord Hewitt, wrote his famous polemic treatise, The New Despotism’, the people in the United Kingdom have been seized with the need to try to control in a firm, sensible fashion the great mass of subordinate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Moreton mentioned Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hewitt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to call, if I may, a witness to say that it is nonsense and the witness is no less a person than  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to that stage, this had been one of the most peaceful demonstrations, testified to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, that this country has ever seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory at the moment is such that it is very difficult to get a case brought on for trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People do not receive a very high standard of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that sort of situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be of interest to honourable members to look at the final words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor which appear at page 5 of their separate judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act was, to quote the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, ‘so wide and general in its terms that it offends against a principle that it is for Parliament, and not the Executive, to legislate for the people of the Commonwealth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this argument that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox rejected because in his view the notice that was originally contained in the Government Gazette stated with reasonable clarity that the ordinance had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fancy going to this Attorney-General and asking him to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a case of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Leader informs me now that the Attorney-General has already informed the honourable member for Prospect that he will not give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this young girl, who has been put into gaol by a man who had absolutely no legal right to put her into gaol, unless she goes to some barrister or engages counsel to make an application for her and pays for it out of her own pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there should be outside the Parliament altogether - independent of the Parliament and independent of the Executive^ - a system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is administered through the courts of this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is not to cast into doubt the powers of the courts of this land; its purpose is not to cast into doubt the ability of the magistrates, justices and judges to adjudicate on the rights and wrongs of individual cases before them; its purpose is to guarantee those rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me draw attention to page 118 of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, to whom the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory referred as his silent witness, where he states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The details of the ordinance have been specified - the date of the ordinance, the year of the ordinance, the price of the ordinance, where the ordinance is available - the fact that this was referred to by initials, other than in full exposition, is the one and only matter that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has drawn on as the basis of his decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are still the common law provisions to which  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox referred and the Government has taken action in such a way as to ensure that those people who have misguidedly taken a short term advantage of what they saw as a right should not take it as a continuing right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It acted in accordance with an interpretation of the common law given by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently I went to the watchhouse to act in my capacity as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have learnt this not through the law courts as my friends opposite have, but because of the duties I perform in my capacity as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and because my office is near the Pentridge Prison I see a lot of the products of this haphazard administration of the law and the laying of charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox made the following observation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory has suggested, as the honourable member for Fremantle has said, that it would have been possible to move the campers under the general law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in May 1970  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, as he then was, made certain recommendations in his report of his inquiry into academic salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government, after consultation with State governments, has concluded that the time is appropriate for such a review and, on 11th September 1972, I announced that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell of the Supreme Court of Queensland had been appointed to conduct an inquiry into academic salaries in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell will be assisted by Professor R. L. Mathews, Professor of Accounting and Public Finance of the Australian National University, and  Mr M.  C. Timbs, Executive Member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, as assessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Campbell’s inquiry will not be examining salaries at colleges of advanced education because the Commonwealth is adhering to the principles of the Sweeney report that salaries of lecturers and senior lecturers in colleges of advanced education should be broadly the same as those in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to provide a 3-year crash programme with unmatched Commonwealth grants for increased hostel type accommodation and to do this in a way that will provide a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those organisations that were pioneers in this field and which provided these beds prior to the 1957 government initiative of $2 for $1 for every bed provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to draw the attention of the House to what may be regarded as an ambiguity in my second reading speech on the States Grants (Universities) Bill 1972 and in my public announcement of 11th September when virtually identical  words  were used relating to the date of effect of increases in academic salaries arising from the inquiry to be conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that the Commonwealth will stand ready to make supplementary grants to the States on the basis of the usual formula in order to cover increases in academic salaries to take effect from 1st January 1973 which may arise from the recommendations in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell’s inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any such increases will, of course, require a Government decision on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question concerns the opinion which 3 States obtained and sent on to the Commonwealth, from Professor D. P. O’Connell, the Chichele Professor of International Law at the University of Oxford, on action which Australia can take before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to enjoin France from continuing nuclear testing in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite its logic the case for a parliamentary review of the repatriation legislation was rejected by the Government, although it has now appointed an independent inquiry into the Act under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright found for the settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the reduced rentals were to apply to conform with the judgment handed down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright and that the Commonwealth agreed that these proposals would apply also to those settlers who had already signed their leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply point out that if the reduced rentals are to apply also to those who have signed their leases in South Australia, there is no reason why the same <span class="highlight">justice</span> in adjusting valuations and rentals cannot apply to settlers in Western Australia and Tasmania where the Commonwealth has an overriding authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Pike came up with recommendations that were accepted by the Commonwealth and by the States at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a unique opportunity for us to complete some of the great works that were put in hand, such as the great investigation work that was carried out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Pike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were unfortunate in having to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, it has taken  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward some time to pick up all the threads but he has informed me that he will report on the 2 matters on which he has to report to the Government within the next 5 or 6 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in restrospect for this Government, even though it subsequently came to recognise the folly of its ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are dealing with the estimates for the Attorney-General’s Department, I take it that it will be in order for me to speak about truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that the Attorney-General’s Department is dealing in matters of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, the Chief Judge in Divorce in New South Wales, is on record as saying on 9th June that Commonwealth legal aid should be provided in some divorce cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the advice of such an outstanding jurist as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby should be heeded by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I suggest to the Committee is that this is a very flagrant proposed departure from a very basic principle of law and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a substantial departure from the very basic principle of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great Britain, I believe, is the land of the free where everyone has <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has adopted the British common law and I believe it gives the average person a better chance for <span class="highlight">justice</span> than there is in any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has worked better than the system of any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When some of us decided that this was a ridiculous thing to happen and that we had an Attorney-General who was obviously not prepared to carry out the law but was only prepared to play politics, a barrister appeared in a Sydney court on Thursday and applied for a writ of habeas corpus in public chambers before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Solicitor-General was contacted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares or vice versa and he asked for an adjournment of the case until the following morning so that the case would never come to hearing because they knew that by the following morning they would have the legislation through the Senate which would retrospectively assure the appointment of  Mr Dobson,  S.M., on the previous Monday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the barrister put it to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor the following morning, it was a specious application by the AttorneyGeneral on behalf of the Commonwealth Government to ask for an adjournment on the Thursday so that the Commonwealth could argue that the appointment of a magistrate was valid, because the Commonwealth Government never believed that the appointment of that magistrate was valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to talk in terms of abolition of poverty and if we are to talk about bringing social <span class="highlight">justice</span> into our society - I am sure there would be very few people in this category - I believe, that this anomaly must be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which he talks about, the sort of moral concern for pensioners which is shown by his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive governments have for years endeavoured to find a way to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the needs of pensioners and at the same time provide a national retiring allowance on a basis satisfactory to all and one which suits Australia’s national needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other is the independent inquiry into the Repatriation Act being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October last year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, C.B.E., was nominated to carry out the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to be able to say that I know  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose personally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to a very solid report coming from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to say much about it because I know the members serving on the Senate select committee inquiring into repatriation and I know  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, and I have no doubt that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and the Senate committee will know how to assess the value of the evidence before them and how to establish the correct order of value when they arrive at their findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contains a discussion by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Denning on the question of what might cause cancer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could have been that in this case <span class="highlight">justice</span> was denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the case had been brought in Australia <span class="highlight">justice</span> would have been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Denning said that where there was a probability or even a possibility, or as long as it was not beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the disease was war-caused there was an opportunity for the tribunal to find that the cancer was due to war service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So section 47 is not achieving the <span class="highlight">justice</span> it was meant to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell the Minister for Repatriation that for any fair dinkum member of Parliament who is prepared to make himself available there are stacks of ex-servicemen in this country who contend - and who justifiably contend in my view - that they are not getting their due or <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of the matters raised by honourable members in this debate are being considered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, who is heading the independent inquiry into repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is <span class="highlight">justice</span> for war widows generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry could act as co-ordinator for both of these ministries in relation to all international activities, but the Office of Secondary Industry, whilst serving a most useful function, does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the future potential of Australia’s industrial development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that a lot more <span class="highlight">justice</span> could have been done if there had been a much higher relative exemption for rural properties as against other properties, because it seems that what is regarded as a return on capital in a farm would never be tolerated as a return on capital somewhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There must be <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only in the independent schools which need <span class="highlight">justice</span> and help; <span class="highlight">justice</span> must also be meted out in the area of those state schools, which are also in need of help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the ‘honour-able gentleman has performed a public service by drawing attention to the opinion of a distinguished jurist like  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Winneke and his comments in the Arthur Mills oration on this particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr. <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Winneke says, this just is not so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a departure from every principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> with which we are familiar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that meeting this need was made known to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore by way of a question from a person who I understand represented the Employers’ Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore quite properly indicated that this was a political decision and not one within his jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite talk about industrial relations and wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  on Monday Conference’ or some other programme of that nature the other night said that in 12 months time Australia will have overfull employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So although my officers will do their best to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and pensions are payable as soon as possible my strong advice to anybody in doubt as to his pension eligibility would be to get a form and reapply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth will also be prepared to provide additional financial assistance on the basis of the usual formula of a contribution of Si by the Commonealth for every $1.85 of State grants plus fees in respect of increases in academic salaries from 1st January 1973 that may be determined by government decision as a result of the enquiry into academic salaries in universities that is being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  W.

    <p>I refer to the Hansard report of the proceedings of the New South Wales Parliament of 25th February 1969, which relates to an Equity Court case which lasted for some 55 days and which was heard by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street who delivered the judgment on 19th December 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is trying to take credit unto itself on the basis that, by what it calls fine tuning to the extent of providing $20m or $10m or, in the case of Tasmania, $7,600,000, it somehow is doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he tell the do-gooders who have been pressurising bis Department on African and Asian migration to exhaust themselves in doing something practical to help fair dinkum Australians to do something worthwhile for the Australian Aborigines who alone have a claim for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair treatment by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-53-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No suggestion has been put before us that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was talking through his hat in the case of Bonser v.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor has it been argued that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was wrong when he said that the existing situation in respect of fisheries is pregnant with practical difficulties, particularly if there is at any time any diversity between Commonwealth and State laws with respect to fishing on the high seas’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> it is wrong for Australian citizens to be liable to be subjected to this kind of a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternatively we could accept what has been described in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> decision in the North Sea continental shelf case as the natural prolongation of the land under the sea to the land to which it is appurtenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where before has he been backed up by one of his brother justices,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer who fully agreed with his sentiments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you want to take it further you have no less than the opinion of a former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Percy  Spender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there ever before been such a pathetic spectacle as that of the senior legal representatives of the  Commonwealth  of Australia and of the State of New South Wales both tiptoeing into the High Court and, very ashamedly and in a very small voice, suggesting to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> that he should not adjudicate on the question of sovereignty in respect to the continental shelf? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The then Attorney-General,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, aspired to get uniform legislation on these subjects by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a good deal of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the argument, so I hope that in the course of time this request will be granted and that as many people as is reasonably economically possible - I am sure the service could be improved - will be able to have local call access to their main business centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any disinclination by the Commonwealth to subsidise shipping in a thorough going way or in an obvious way is seen to be less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> tor those who benefit from shipping in Tasmania, Of course the problem often lies in the fact that everybody benefits or does not benefit by the functions of shipping because most of the produce and material products which are distributed to Tasmanian consumers are imported either from Australia at large or from overseas through mainland Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be less than <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I think, not to draw attention to the fact that the Commonwealth has shown a continuing interest in the problems of Tasmanian shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is impossible to say with any <span class="highlight">justice</span> that there has been concealment in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my judgment the democratic processes of Parliament could be made to work much more efficiently if only the Government were to dispense a little more <span class="highlight">justice</span> all round, rather than to adopt the somewhat avaricious attitude it has shown over the years towards the Ministry and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-17-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is willing to send men to Vietnam, yet the system it has- set up cannot possibly give them economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems quite absurd to me that a government which can recognise the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of full wages during compensation for incapacity up to 26 weeks should say that once a person has suffered 26 weeks of incapacity, beyond that point he can go no further but must revert to ordinary weekly wages which, even with the amendments proposed by the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  will amount to only $43 a week for a single man and $54 for a man with a wife with an additional $5 a week for each child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless it is pleased to note that the Minister has seen the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of its policy in respect of 26 weeks of a person’s incapacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can never understand why the Government thinks it is possible to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people by specifying a fixed sum of money, being that amount of money which the Government uses for ascertaining the lump sum payments by applying a percentage to that sum of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is far better to do the thing properly and give him complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> by giving him the full amount of what he has lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in passing that, had it not been for the actions of this Government in encouraging a climate in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore as arbitrator and umpire could come into the field, the oil strike might still have been with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was never arbitration, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason denied that it was arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Government was convinced that this was a genuine difference of opinion as to the appropriate common fee to which to apply that 1.5 per cent and that the overwhelming majority of divergencies in charges were just over the common fee and in the application of the 15 per cent to that higher amount the Government asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason with limited terms of reference, to inquire into this divergence of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason found in favour of the application of the 15 per cent to the higher fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one would not have expected any change in the figures yet because the new fees as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason came into being only as from 1st July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one point which he mentioned that really needs to be dealt with, and that was his statement that there was only one point in dispute over the issue which led to arbitration by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He implied that this situation was effectively solved by the arbitration findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument of the Minister for Immigration that the whole thing was ironed out by what happened in the informal arbitration proceedings before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason is completely fallacious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had an inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason to examine what would happen to the common fee in New South Wales and then unilaterally the Government made a decision that fee increases would go not only to New South Wales but to every general practitioner in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Victoria,  Sir Henry  Winneke, has made this absolutely plain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to comment on the point that the Minister made in claiming that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason had only to make the decision on the question of the higher base line figure - the 1st July 1969 figure - on which the 15 per cent increase in the middle of last year was based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on to say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason found that the claim made by the Australian Medical Association for the higher base line figure was correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Minister - I suppose that, being only the Minister representing the Minister for Health in this House, he does not have to know all the facts - that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason made no such finding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was the only person to appear before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason to oppose the proposition advanced by the AMA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason found was that the Department of Health was unable to supply adequate figures which could distinguish between the proposition put forward by the Australian Medical Association and the proposition which I put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would argue, firstly, that it is scandalous for a government that has been in power for so long and for a department of health that uses up a large amount of money on administration to be unable to supply a definite base line figure for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason to work on and, secondly, that it is scandalous for the Government not to appear and oppose the proposition advanced by the AMA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hov ever, as in the case of The Hague Convention there are still many difficulties in constructing an effective deterrent and preventive structure because of the diverse motives of individual hijackers, among them being the mentally deranged criminals in flight from <span class="highlight">justice</span> who use passengers as hostages to demand money, and political escapees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am delighted that the privilege of introducing these historic measures - of rectifying this denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> - has fallen to me and that it is one of the first legislative acts of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel certain that <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this House will be meted out by you in a very fine manner, I note that you are reported to be a cueist of no small ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was lovely to see them standing as one in this place, fighting for democracy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to save one minute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the most erudite commentators to the most humble observers there has been a common plea for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> to my friend, the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  and to members of the Opposition I believe I should explain the reasoning of honourable members on this side of the House in relation to the difficulty that arose in the last 10 minutes of the Address-in-Reply debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite do not have a monopoly of a concern for social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as they often like to imply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our present education concentrates too much on preparing a person for a job-slot or earning an income rather than fostering a community spirit of freedom and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, tolerance and social responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a House of responsibility - a responsibility to be exercised with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be careful also that in some areas our social welfare payments are just to all in the community and that the penalties we impose on certain sections of our society do not outweigh the <span class="highlight">justice</span> we are doing to others or, put another way, that we do not give to one section on the one hand and take away from another section on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be sure that in its application our policy is just to all sections of the community and that this backlash or reaction does not develop and retard the progress of true social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our community and, as a result, hurt more those people whom  we  are trying to help with this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Barnard),  who represents the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Bishop)  in this House, in his evidence to the independent inquiry into repatriation conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, said that he thought that the proposal by the RSL for a funeral benefit of $200 was reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate on repatriation benefits is another symbol of parliamentary search to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people who have served this country in war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should continue this search to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the present repatriation procedures, designed as they have been to produce <span class="highlight">justice</span> and administrative competence, have perhaps become concerned more with admin’istrative competence than with actual <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it is not a matter that one can determine immediately but I should point out to the House that, as honourable members know, there is at this time a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose looking into the Repatriation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I extended the period in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose would have the opportunity to investigate the Repatriation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I extended the terms of reference of that Committee and, for the information of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I point out that I asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to take into consideration, with the other matters at which he would be looking, the question of repatriation hospitals and what extensions should be made to them in terms of the facilities they provide and in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a matching moral and ethical advancement, without a sense of community responsibility, without respect for others, without personal and government integrity, without a massive caring for others, without a sharing of opportunity, without a love of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, without a love for the underdog, without a tolerance for opposing viewpoints and without a faith in something beyond ourselves, true progress is impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sholl said about people who genuflect to the bullies of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a 7 per cent increase in the price of steel was mooted by BHP this year the Labor Government set up an inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore who, after hearing all the evidence, determined that a price increase of 3 per cent was the maximum that could be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore was an important forerunner to an important policy item of this Government, that is, the establishment of a prices justification tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should warn the members of the Opposition that, if they are not careful, their actions and words in this regard will only backfire on them and, because of the progress made by the Government reinforce the views of those who believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, and convince many of those who have been led to believe they should be opposed to the word socialism that, in fact, it is in the best interests of the nation - because this is what we are about - the establishment of a fair society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government believes that it has the option of going to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to gain an injunction against France carrying out these tests in our atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The physical features which give Australia that option of approaching the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against the French tests are not applicable against the Chinese tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the House referred to our lack of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in not lowering the voting age, yet in his second reading speech, by quoting the Prime Minister’s words, he showed clearly that it was Australia under Liberal-Country Party governments which enabled young people to attain the all-round maturity and competence which now makes them eligible, arid rightly so, to participate more, fully in the democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These States, jealous of their State rights and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, would seem justified in demanding votes at Federal elections for their enfranchised under their State laws, but section 41 of the Federal Constitution states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> also held that to change the franchise for Commonwealth electors it was not necessary to change the Constitution but only to change the Electoral Act as provided for under section 30 of the Federal Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By 18 most young people are ready for these responsibilities and rights, and would greatly profit by them, as would the teaching authorities, the business community, the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the overwhelming claim of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and righteousness and the fact that increased representation was correct because the Australian Capital Territory was hopelessly under-represented, the then Government refused to introduce this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, it endeavoured to throw the responsibility onto the court, but in the clearest terms the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> rejected that responsibility and threw it back to this Parliament where it belongs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward’s terms of reference bear specific relation to the Northern Territory because there can be, under the present administrative arrangements, no let or hindrance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very likely that when it has to hand  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s report the Commonwealth will exercise its constitutional powers if need be by way of acquisition of these Aboriginal reserves and other relevant lands to which the Aborigines can reasonably claim title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the best answer I can give to the honourable member’s question is to point out that the old divorce rules have been subject to a great deal of criticism by some of the most learned and responsible people familiar with the subject, including  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, the senior judge in divorce in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party believes, and the public, by and large, believes, that as a matter of equity and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> something ought to be done about prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that the intention behind this Bill is designed to do <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs mentioned in his second reading speech, this Government has appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to examine the question of land rights in the Northern Territory in order to ascertain how in each individual situation, we can best vest these lands in the hands of the Aboriginal people who live in these communities and reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as an Aboriginal land rights commissioner to make a report on the best means of achieving the Government’s aims in this area, and, in doing so, the Government is only falling into line with what has been done in a number of other countries which have had to face the injustices that have been done to their indigenous people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Gove judgment, which did not accept Aboriginal sovereignty over the Gove Peninsula, has given rise to land rights claims based on moral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> at all in making one law for the Northern Territory Aborigines and another for dispossessed Aborigines in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, I am reminded of the fact that it was a New South Wales Labor government which introduced legal aid for Europeans through the office of the Public Defender in the New South Wales Department of the Attorney-General and of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The physical features which give Australia that option of approaching the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against the  Frencn  tests are not applicable against the Chinese tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A significant build-up in the rate of inflation makes the Government’s professions of concern for social <span class="highlight">justice</span> ring very hollow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A brief examination of the problems which were apparent during  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore’s recent evaluation of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd’s price submissions can only demonstrate beyond doubt the difficulties and complexities inherent in any committee examination of the pricing policy and structure of a particular company or industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most pertinent to this debate to note the recent re-statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby - he quoted the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon - in support of his view that the arbitral authorities cannot and will not accept any responsibility for economic management in making their awards and determinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well and truly time, as was expounded in the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  when he was Leader of the Opposition at the end of last year, for the establishment of some ombudsman-type organisation to act as a link between the people, the Parliament and the bureaucracy to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to all in the community and not simply to one section of it as, for instance, the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a good example of this was the recent case involving proposed increases in steel prices by Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd which was heard by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, at the time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr made his recommendations he was considering the Leader of the Australian Country Party as the  Deputy  Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1971 proposals, arrived at after the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, were not implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1971  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr proposed that the salary should be $13,000 and that there should be a further review soon after the next general elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount proposed is $4,100 - the amount recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr for country electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr proposed that these amounts should be raised to $13,300 and $9,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended that the Prime Ministerial salary should be raised to $27,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the special allowance for Ministers is concerned, the legislation now before the House basically applies  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, when he examined the situation in December 1971, said that he believed it was necessary for country members to be accorded a greater electorate allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another suggestion in the amending legislation relates to the basis on which the payments should be made in accordance with the scale prescribed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr but varied in some instances according to later circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, in the scale laid down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, some recommendations applicable to the circumstances in December 1971 which have changed over the course of the 1.8 months since it was laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr examined the circumstances of the leader of the third major party in the House of Representatives he spoke of the fact that at the time the salary was not appropriate because a coalition government was in office and the then leader of the party was in fact enjoying the salary of a  Deputy  Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr did recognise the circumstances of difference which apply to the leader of the third major party in this p’ace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been done in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me go through the present position of the Leader of the third Party - the Leader of the Country Party; the proposals that were made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr: the Bill that was brought in by the previous Government; and the present Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended that he should have a salary of S4.800 a year and a special allowance of S 1,400 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leader of the third party is the only office bearer in the Parliament for whom this Bill makes more generous provision than was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition should have a salary not of S5.000 but of $7,500, and the leader of the third party should have a salary not of $2,500 but of $4,800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended that the salary of the leader of the third party should be a little less than doubled; the Bill provides that it should be doubled; and the amendment is that it should be trebled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no other case has the Government proposed a salary greater than that recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case alone we are recommending a salary greater than that recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr - admittedly only $200 more - but we believe that the proposition that the Parliament should be asked to grant an increase of $2,700 more than recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr is unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has established a system of industrial arbitration for private industry unequalled in the world for achieving wage and industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only decision that can be made is made by the Minister for Immigration on the advice of many organs of government and we will be proceeding with <span class="highlight">justice</span> and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that there will be a basis on which there can be a safe progression to a direct transmission of the affairs of the nation as conducted in this chamber - not a distorted one, not a slanted one, not one that would be misleading, but one that would be fair and honest both to the nation, which after all will have to put up with it if it is to see Parliament on television, and to this House, where impartiality has always been a byword and where members would like to see fair play and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in every direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in my mind one of the main architects in seeing that the Commonwealth public servants never had <span class="highlight">justice</span> from previous Government was the right honourable member for Higgins who jumped the gun on that occasion and, in my view, forestalled a possibility - maybe it was a possibility that would not have come into effect - that the then Government could have granted it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a way to deal with the rights of Commonwealth public servants who seek not a hand out but <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I hope is that the lead will be taken by employers outside the Commonwealth Public Service and that they will give the same measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to their employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appointed the committee, which was headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, with the object, in the first place, of preparing a new evidence code which would be something of model for the rest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having disposed of the myth that the Labor Party is alone in seeking electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> we can turn to and destroy some of the other political myths that the Labor Party is throwing as propaganda in relation to this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property quotes with reverence Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States in support of his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree totally with Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren that as nearly as practicable one man’s vote should be worth as much as another’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently a terrible, undemocratic gerrymander operates in the United States where under the fiat of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of the United States there is a tolerance of 15 per cent and slightly above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case to which I have referred the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the United States spoke about the effects of redistributing and said how impossible it was to be utterly rigid about these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was making a plea then for some semblance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for growing areas of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also contrary to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as I will make clear in the course of my speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do so because the present Act has effectively ensured the practical adherence to the principle of one vote one value and in doing so it has produced electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> as judged by that criterion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The slogan that the Government and the Labor Party is using as a smokescreen on this issue is grossly misleading, it is a cynical attempt to confuse the Australian public by construing the Government as the champion of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interest of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and responsibility to the Australian community the Bill must be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  in his second reading speech referred to the desirability of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that is a pretty worthy principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In common sense terms this would not offend the basic concept of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not, however, always been the guiding principle in State redistributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, when a Bill such as this comes up under the guise of a so-called mandate from the people and under the guise of seeking electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it needs to be exposed for the sham that it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is to proceed with a redistribution, it should do so under the provisions of the present Act or substantially alter its Bill to ensure that it is not seen to be setting up machinery to reflect its own selfish political interests by denying real and sustainable electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other principles of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> have been fought for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe they are doing this in the belief that if they mutter slogans like ‘one vote one value’ at the same time as they talk about the 20 per cent margin and draw attention to the fact that the Electoral Commissioners are required to have some regard to problems of area and distance, a sense of injustice will be created in the minds of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that by referring in emotive terms to constituent parts, such as the 20 per cent margin allowed and other criteria which the Electoral Commissioners are required to take into account in a redistribution, attention will be diverted from the final results which the present system produces, which I say without fear of contradition is electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This objective is the very travesty of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are doing this in an attempt to arouse a sense of injustice amongst metropolitan voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are trying to brainwash us into believing that there is electoral injustice and that this is caused by some sort of preferential treatment which is being given to country voters that in some way reduces the value of the vote of the metropolitan elector and the weight that he has in determining the government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that I and my colleagues on this side of the House have proved conclusively that this sort of propaganda and these statements are arrant, mischievous, self-interested nonsense and can be based only on a desire to replace a system which produces broad electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> with a blatant gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let members of the Opposition be assured that the real reason behind the Government’s action is to ensure electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the whole of the electorate of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have led the fight against the established interests in our society to obtain some form of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We as a Parliament have always taken many of our customs from the Parliament at Westminster and, whilst that institution is referred to as the mother of Parliaments, the stage that it has reached today did not come about without a continuing fight for fair representation and some form of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would have enabled those who now cry to high heaven for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this place the right to express their point of view, certainly with a limited time of 10 minutes, but when all is said and done not everyone can speak for 20 minutes on every second reading debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as a matter of immediacy I think we should use all the agencies at our disposal, including the Commonwealth and State Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, to attempt to identify the offenders among the extremist groups and to bring them to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So slowly did the mills of <span class="highlight">justice</span> grind then that now we have to tackle the position that deteriorated under the right honourable gentleman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  has said that this Bil] is a means of bringing about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> I say that it will not do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It denies electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say: All we are trying to do is to bring about <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the second reading debate on the Bill several Opposition members suggested that because we wish to amend the Act to introduce a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> into the redistri bution that is about to take place and to take away the heavy weighting in favour of the Country Party that has protected that Party and enabled it to send back to this Parliament members such as the honourable member for Kennedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than criticise our intention to do this, if Country and Liberal Party members opposite had any sense of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and basic honesty in the redistribution that is about to be carried out, they would be prepared to say: ‘The Labor Party says it can conduct a redistribution on the basis of a 10 per cent variation above or below the quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no cause in a democracy to pervert the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> because a government does not give members adequate facilities to represent the people by whom they are sent to this Parliament to state a case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959 certainly saw it in this way for it regarded a tolerance for certain electorates of 10 per cent above or below the quota as sufficient to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to rural interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s objectives are clear and blatant and they have nothing to do with electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member represents a big city electorate but he also believes that we are fighting for <span class="highlight">justice</span> on behalf of everybody, both in the city and in the country, and should not be trying to set one section of Australia against another, i know that beneath the benign exterior of the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who introduced this Bill, he too agrees with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is designed purely and simply to bring more <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all citizens in electorates throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, Australia can, we believe, take action in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against France because of her atmospheric tests, action which is not available to Australia to take against China in the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you were elected to office,  Mr Speaker,  I spoke briefly and said that I believed you were a man who could carry put the job, that you had displayed an understanding of Parliament during your manyyears here and that provided you dispensed <span class="highlight">justice</span> without bias and impartially you would have the support of this side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in this place a very real need to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only be seen and observed but be practised if it is to be seen, observed and practised in the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only by having an opportunity to make statements to rebut the charges of the Prime Minister that we on this side of the House can for all time lay at rest the thought that in any way we were less than diligent in our efforts to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was duly exercised and that in any way any one of us would condone violence in our community or subscribe to the allegation that we were puppets of people here or in any other part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt comes in recognition of the special rights and needs of migrants in this country - <span class="highlight">justice</span> too long denied them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the other hand I believe that those who claim to support market mechanisms in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> have a lot to answer for in regard to the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those people will heed and listen to exhortation and do <span class="highlight">justice</span> as well, we may not need as much regulation as now seems necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>am determined to do all in my power as Minister to keep political terrorists out of Australia and to apply the deportation provisions of the Migration Act to the fullest extent, consistent with our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I give this pledge on behalf of the Government of Australia: I pledge myself to <span class="highlight">justice</span> - <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the community, to the individual concerned and to the many thousands of good people who, with faith in us and in our country, have pledged their future with ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is time that we had an examination of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bradfield, who raised this matter with all his great forthrightness and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, now sits as idle and as silent as can be over the greatest gerrymander that, as he knows, has ever been put on in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who wish to leave Australia for a variety of reasons after making a contribution to this country will receive due <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that Bill had become law, more than 300,000 unnaturalised migrants who perhaps wished to return to their homelands would have been denied pension <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, in a great gesture of acceding to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the wishes of this Parliament and the wishes of every State Parliament in this nation, he sentenced this creature to 12 months gaol, to serve a minimum of 2 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that I shall have an opportunity of bringing a private member’s Bill for this purpose before this Parliament in due course but I do not believe that national superannuation should be involved with this simple question of <span class="highlight">justice</span> - the abolition of the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all these studies the Government’s aim will be to create conditions for the achievement of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and industrial harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the task of the national Parliament to create labour relations which meet and match the needs of the community and which will anticipate and overcome obstacles to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and common sense in industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary not even the Red Army, which has no national sympathy for the workers of those countries, has been able to prevent great strikes for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and better living standards, tanks and field guns notwithstanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The union executive against which I was taking my action for <span class="highlight">justice</span> - it was an action for <span class="highlight">justice</span> because in both cases I won - was able to draw upon the funds of the union, but I was a private individual with no money except my own personal possessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to point out that he uses these words as a criticism of the employees, although the wages and conditions were granted to the employees by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, a gentleman who I am sure has the respect not only of this House but also of those engaged in industrial activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely this is the distinguishing characteristic of the servile state where the processes of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> are conducted in secret without any regard to security matters in the strict sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An Act which does <span class="highlight">justice</span> to many but not all tends to obscure the fact that many never receive <span class="highlight">justice</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There appears to have been, in some governments since 1949, a ready willingness to aim at the happiness of the greatest number, and to permit the perpetuation of injustice to many, not as a temporary expedient to be remembered, but as an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that the people in this category have been denied <span class="highlight">justice</span> for many years, particularly so as they do not qualify for housing accommodation under any of the public housing schemes of the States, and they experience great difficulty in obtaining housing loans from institutional lenders because of their age, and because of their sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are advised that some persons in this category met their deaths on service, and others became prisoners of war and it is fit and proper that there should be an extension of benefits to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these people and their dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions in this Bill will not only enable the scheme to continue making an important contribution to the national welfare by assisting eligible persons and their families in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain homes but will also bring the privilege of these benefits and restore <span class="highlight">justice</span> to many who were previously deprived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is basically what industrial arbitration is about - the fixing of wages and basic conditions of employment like annual leave, standard hours of work, concepts like the basic wage, margins, work value, comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and conciliation, all principles turned to by unions, employers and arbitrators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill seeks greater social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and harmony in our industrial relations and it will go a long way towards achieving those aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over a period of years the Liberal Party-Country Party Governments relied on industrial laws which were directed against workers and industry to deprive workers of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the areas of wages and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall no occasion during my lifetime when a member of a government has asked a foreign firm to fight workers of this country in an endeavour to deprive them of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> in respect of conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1904  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins, of the then just formed Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, said of that Commission - or Court as it was then called - that it would end the law of the jungle and bring back order and reason into industrial affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But outside a totalitarian dictatorship no government can suppress concerted stoppages of work and no democratic government should want to stop concerted stoppages of work by people who can no longer bear the burden of wage injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins in 191 1 put the position succinctly when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That Australia welcomes all migrants as candidates for citizenship under common and uniform conditions for all countries will, I know, appeal to an inbuilt British sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its fundamental base is <span class="highlight">justice</span> - civil, legal and distributive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recent rulings in Australian courts, such as the ruling given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt and the ruling by  His  Honour Judge Levine, make it clear that when an abortion is performed by a qualified medical practitioner and the doctor claims that the operation was performed in the interests of the patient, conviction is very unlikely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion, but perhaps not in the opinion of others, it raises matters of law, of health, of responsibility, of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, of ethics, of morals and of personal and community standards and values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: this House is of opinion that a royal commission, of which the  Chairman  shall be a Supreme Court <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and a majority of members shall be women, should enquire into and report within 12 months upon: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The acceleration in the development of fertility control services in Britain since 1967, the appointment of  Mrs <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lane’s committee of inquiry - and I emphasise the word  Mrs’ -  into the operation of the Abortion Act, the quality of evidence presented so far to the Lane Committee and the public backing for the Committee’s work all support the view that nations such as our own will rise to the challenge of fertility control if the abortion problem is brought home vividly enough to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we must be concerned with social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this context, we must recognise also that trade union movements have become more concerned with immediate industrial objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude of the Broken Hill Pty Co.

    <p>Sir Percy  Spender, who was a Minister and a member of this Parliament for a long time and also a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, said in 1969 that the Australian Constitution gave the Commonwealth sovereignty over the off-shore of Australia and that the Commonwealth Parliament ought to be able to legislate in relation to the areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister in his second reading speech places his reliance for Commonwealth authority on an obiter dicta made by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the case of Bonser v.

    <p>It has been said that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick - I have read the remarks he made in the court case concerned- has declared that the State responsibility and authority ends at the low water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I firmly uphold the view that this legislation is not concerned with accuracy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and State rights but is a thrust of pragmatic political professionalism in action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But insofar as we consider the political questions and not the legal questions it seems to be just elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> that all Australians should share equally in all these benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament will be glad, of course, to recall that my Government recently appointed <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt, a most outstanding woman in the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were able to appoint <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt to the position because she had better qualifications in our view than anybody else offering, men or women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore the amendments already before this Committee - those proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland - are the first step in the direction of correcting a very serious imbalance, in fact, a denial of real <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this matter, and the other foreshadowed amendments that would follow would, of course, serve the purpose, of correcting this very iniquitous legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course we propose to go further and there will be a cognate Bill relating to representation in the Senate, which, together with the Bill before the House, will give a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian Capital Territory at this stage of its development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> delayed is of course <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied and yet it was in the Senate that action was taken by this Parliament which so profoundly affected the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was Professor O’Connell’s advice, I believe, which was responsible for Australia, New Zealand and Fiji relying on the 1928 General Act for the pacific settlement of international disputes, in bringing their dispute in this matter to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill proposes amendments to the appeals provisions of the income tax law to transfer to the State Supreme Courts the jurisdiction of single justices of the High Court in income tax appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a pressing need to relieve the High Court, so far as possible, of the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By far the greater volume of work presented in the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> jurisdiction of the High Court consists of income tax appeals, either appeals brought directly from a Commissioner’s decision or from a decision of a board of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principally, these will permit the High Court to remit to a Supreme Court any of the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> income tax matters which have come to it under the present law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Australian Government also recognises the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case for assistance to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, the present Government strongly criticised the Opposition for its failure to provide the tenth member for Western Australia at the last election, thus denying electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should not be offensive to local government bodies because many of them are already grouped in a variety of ways, for a variety of functions - for example, regional libraries, social security, administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, refuse disposal and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They lambast us with International Labour Organisation principles and average wages; but where are they when it comes to dispensing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a section of the community which is subject to tremendous pressure from economy, science, philosophy and now a Government which is not concerned with its plight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current position was put clearly by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell of the New South Wales Land and Valuation Court when he stressed that there are too many local authorities with areas and responsibilities resulting from historical accident rather than conscious planning or economic appropriations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course he believes in that for the simple reason that he does not believe in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was concerned about certain repressive and regressive provisions of the Ordinance which the Minister has now indicated that he is prepared to rectify for the sake of human <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a Budget of reconstruction and of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and one which is designed to increase the efficiency of our mixed economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, the emphasis has to be on the income, not on the product, to provide <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court could be removed from office only if there was an address from both Houses of Parliament in the same session praying for his removal, and the grounds for his removal were limited to proved misbehaviour’ or incapacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the tenure of a High Court <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not dependent on the Crown in any case including misbehaviour except when the Crown acts on an address from both Houses of the Parliament; and furthermore it is not open to the Parliament to present an address for the removal of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> on any other grounds than for proved misbehaviour or incapacity, and that is under section 72 (ii.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be noted that, in the context of life tenure operating to guarantee integrity in justices, State Supreme Court justices all hold tenure for a term of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cite the example that in 1937  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt, who later became Leader of the Opposition, delivered the sole dissenting judgment in the case of Cowell v.

    <p>Unlike previous governments, the proximity of elections will not be a deciding factor in the rate at which pensions are increased; rather it will be our commitment to achieve social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> for pensioners to establish pension payments at an adequate level and as a right, and to maintain these principles consistently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be hoped that the program can be accelerated so as to eliminate the possibility that the few remaining people who campaigned so vigorously do not pass from this world before seeing the fruits of their efforts to bring the social conscience of Australia to bear on the need for all aged people to receive social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One television commentator even said that there could be no doubt that I had got information from Australia’s representative on the Court, as he described him - the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, I had had no communication with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> between the time that I asked him whether he would accept nomination as judge ad hoc and some days after the publication of the Court’s judgment when he wrote to me personally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Prime Minister recall his criticism in 1955 of the High Court and his statement that he regarded the resignations in 1950 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stark ‘as flagrant examples of where resignations were withheld until there was a change of government’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recognising this, to save Australia from further embarrassment as a nation which has discriminatory citizenship, and to bring some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to migrants, to rescue the Bill from a Senate pigeon-hole - now a deep well for all sorts of things which have been irresponsibly rejected - this Government reluctantly accepts the Senate amendment and  1  commend the motion that I have moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a newcomer to this place I have found it quite strange to watch the antics of honourable members opposite, particularly members of the Australian Country Party who protesteth most strongly at a rearrangement of financial priorities which will bring social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> to millions of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Faced with legitimate criticism of some of the consequences of the 1967 Abortion Act, the British Government has responded not by repealing or amending that Act but by setting up a committee of inquiry under  Mrs <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lane to report upon  those aspects of administration over which abuses have arisen and by upgrading family planning services in order to reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disturbed and finally disillusioned when I became aware of the true status of the evidence submitted to  Mrs <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lane’s committee of inquiry into the Abortion Act ‘by people described in newspaper reports as Drs Arthur and Margaret Wynn, circulated to honourable members by the Right of Life Association and quoted again by the Association in yesterday’s letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our present system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> contains ample means to protect society from insane or repetitive murders - recidivists - without bringing down on ourselves the public shame of killing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are going to put our administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> into play at that stage, we would find it much easier to be objective if we had a penalty which could be imposed through the courts, which was not barbaric and which did not cause a sense of outrage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had adequate opportunity to establish the rate of pension payments related to a fixed formula which guaranteed that pension rates would move forward regularly according to cost of living movements so that social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be maintained for the most deprived and dependent group in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the tribunals not established to employ reason and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their findings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a basic <span class="highlight">justice</span> - equity - in all Australians whether in the coastal cities, the larger inland cities, the smaller country centres or on the farms, paying similar prices for the same products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But again, I suggest that that is to allow strictly doctrinaire economic thinking to run away and override considerations of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could not go against the views of  Sir Percy  Spender, a former member of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and a former Minister of this House, that the States never had sovereignty over the offshore waters to the 3-mile limit either as colonies or as States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I thought that, having displayed that erudition, he should at least have been aware for example of how the influence of the American Constitution upon Australian constitutional law was put to rest by  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, in the Engineers case in the early 1920s, when the decision of the United States Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland - a decision delivered by one of the most famous chief justices of the United States Court, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Marshall - was clearly decided by the High Court of Australia to have no relevance to the interpretation of the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The strike is partly over hours, but it was stimulated by this Government’s statements concerning a 35-hour week for the Commonwealth Public Service, although I cannot understand what <span class="highlight">justice</span> there is in saying, as the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  says: ‘You can have a 35-hour week if you are in a capitalintensive industry, but you must have a 40-hour week in a labour-intensive industry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  description of the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system of the Northern Territory should be made widely known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the entire criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system in the Northern Territory the Aboriginal has only one role- he is the prisoner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the practice in Queensland for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to table each year a list of counsel who have been retained by the Crown and the amount of fees which have been paid to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should, I suppose, to do him <span class="highlight">justice</span>, have gone through Hansard and checked on the number of questions that he has answered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Adams, and had such experienced and knowledgeable men on it as  Mr Haynes  Leader, the Reverend Paul Albrecht, who is head of the Lutheran Church in the Northern Territory and who was born and bred in the Northern Territory and has vast experience with Aborigines and the alcohol situation, and  Mr Claude  Narjic, a full-blooded Aborigine from Port Keats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It showed that there was consternation about the <span class="highlight">justice</span> situation, the drinking problem and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, the previous Minister for the Northern Territory, did great injustice to the Legislative Council, to the previous Government and to the people who actually put the report together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the Attorney-General achieved legal history when he went to The Hague and appeared as the principal advocate before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> seeking, and obtaining, an interim injunction against France in respect of the nuclear tests that were then being conducted in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a tragedy for the economic development of this country and for social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the people who live outside the capital cities if, when this new Agreement comes into force late next year, the percentage of the allocation for country roads is not at least as high as it is now and also if the inflation factor is not considerably higher than it is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, I would not have spent hours seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am speaking on this point I might mention the report on the reconstruction of the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system in the Northern Territory produced by the Minister for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On his saying that he pleaded not guilty the presiding <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace said: ‘What? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on some occasions in court hearings in small centres the possibility of a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is eliminated by the fact that the Bench and all other persons in court are quite well aware of what in fact happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But anyone who has made any study of the concepts of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the United States could not be but appalled at the maze into which the Supreme Court of the United States has brought the administration of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> by interpretations of various sections of the United States Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be a balance between the desire of the community to have criminals convicted and the desire of the community to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia, we have been lucky that we have had no major scandals which have disproved the fact that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only is done but also is seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do nothing else at this present moment than simply appeal to the House’s sense of fair play and to the Government’s respect for the procedures and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this House, if it has any respect for these things, to allow the House to suspend Standing Orders so that I might have just 5 minutes - I ask no more - to reply to the aspersions cast by the Minister and to expose the falsity of some of the things he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has often been thought by citizens who feel aggrieved by allegations, false or otherwise, or by alleged intimidation and sometimes corruption by policemen, that as the resulting investigation takes place within the force itself the appearance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> does not emerge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government’s policy was a sound one, based on the principle of moral and distributive <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one criticism I would like to make and that is that, in charity and not basic <span class="highlight">justice</span>, extra aid should have been given to the many disadvantaged schools and disadvantaged students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quite readily admit that the previous Government failed in that regard, but I want to emphasise that this is charity and not <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard it as absolutely imperative, based on moral and distributive <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that payments should be equal for all children at similar levels of education irrespective of the school they attend and of the financial position of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat and emphasise that this policy of the Labor Government is unjust and is not based on moral and distributive <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he went on to say that if additional assistance over and above per capita grants were given to such schools and such children it would be charity and not <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed with the Minister for Education because I have always thought that he would place <span class="highlight">justice</span> highly among his principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To find a member of the Country Party wanting <span class="highlight">justice</span> for members of the Parliament is indeed a remarkable discovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the right honourable gentleman now mentions one aspect which he did not put in his earlier question, and that is the aspect of the inquiry being made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  E. A. Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is pursuing his inquiries into this very difficult matter in as expeditious a way as is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  E. A. Woodward has been commissioned by us, as he has by preceding governments, to make inquiries on behalf of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter to be decided on emotion; it is a matter to be decided on <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In case honourable members think that I am voicing a political sentiment I should like to draw the attention of the House of Representatives this evening to the Social <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Statement prepared for the Australian Episcopal Conference by the National Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the great cry of the consumer for <span class="highlight">justice</span> when he is paying high prices for basic elements of his diet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the appreciation of the Government and I believe of the Australian people that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, now the  President  of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, performed the basic pioneering work in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams is the  Chairman  of the Tribunal;  Mr Deputy President  Chambers is the new  Deputy Chairman  whose appointment I announced today in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, now the  President  of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, agreed to undertake this pioneering role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BHP’s claim was not justified before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the expenditure of $100,000 prior to the engaging of legal counsel and the obtaining of scientific evidence to submit to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in an effort to halt the French nuclear tests in the Pacific was excessive when compared with the results achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to refer briefly to the statement made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  in which he expressed concern in respect of the expenditure of $100,000 on the legal case put to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in an attempt to stop the French nuclear tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the Parliament and the nation adopt as goals the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and of continuing peace in this area, not only to avoid the bestiality of limited and endemic war but also to avoid the danger which such war poses to the world and, therefore, to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all political parties in the Parliament would accept the proposition that there should be <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Middle East, that there should be a settlement of the Palestinian problem and that Israel has the right to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody will deny the proposition that there should be <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Middle East, that the Palestinian problem should be resolved and that Israel has the right to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the Ford dispute,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore was absolutely correct in issuing instructions that his reasons for judgment be issued in various migrant languages because there was some evidence that until then the migrant workers in the Ford factory were not really understanding what the dispute was all about, nor were they understanding fully the negotiations .and the compromise proposals that had been worked out by the unions and the employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">justice</span> is there in the community when persons seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> cannot afford it and when a State government resists providing from the public purse assistance to those who seek <span class="highlight">justice</span> but cannot afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rates should be more in keeping with the market in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to dispossessed owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is not stabilisation, the problems of primary industry are such that without ordinary social security benefits that do not apply, there must, in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, be some sort of negative income tax applied to farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that proceedings before review tribunals should, as far as is humanly possible, be open so that everyone can see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know precisely what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen had in mind but if it were the proposals of the Government to supplement some of its legal aid proposals by creating legal offices where salaried lawyers might be employed in certain selected areas of the capital cities of Australia, that is certainly not nationalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that not all circumstances, in which there are restrictions on commercial interchange or on the existence of monopoly or semi-monopoly industry configurations, can be adjudged to be a detriment to economic efficiency or social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the essence of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the courts should have a discretion in such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early 1960s the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, introduced, as a Minister, a progressive set of proposals which was submitted to the House in 1962. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must have been quite a boon for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the day,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, finally to find that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act that was proclaimed in 1967 in an emasculated form compared with the one he had proposed in 1962 was declared invalid by his Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I doubt that the limitations of question time would permit me to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the Government seeks to remedy all the injustices that have occurred in the past in respect of radio and television broadcasting at election times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If these things have occurred, under the proposals of the Government there will be remedy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be given to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and humanity would suggest that one does not deserve to be ill and that in suffering the affliction of being ill one should not be punished by being taxed further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It brings me to the situation of agreeing with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen who said that there are probably too many lawyers in this Parliament and that those who are here are not much good anyhow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is far more qualified than I and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  to pass judgment on the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this because he is qualified in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen would say if he heard that comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the honourable member for Griffith be agreeable to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen being appointed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that members of a tribunal should accept the evidence that is placed before them, treat it impartially and with <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and should be allowed to make their decision without interference from any person or persons outside the tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the House does itself <span class="highlight">justice</span> when it inquires into these matters, but the House has established its own Standing Orders and it certainly would do itself less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> if it allowed those Standing Orders to be ignored and flouted without taking any action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the debate I will answer as quickly as possible the specific questions that are asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this Government and the Postmaster-General himself, in answer to questions and in other ways in this House, have gloried in emphasising what I would call the cash-nexus approach to the provision of services by the PMG - a sort of approach which would do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to some of the worst characters out of a Dickens novel or to the traditional American robber barons of the 19 th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it indicates that we have people who are prepared to look at the position because they have members in these areas and they want to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to the people in the areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was said here, I was viciously attacked for trying to get some <span class="highlight">justice</span> into the postal structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it ought to be pointed out to the House that amongst the members of that Cabinet led by the then Prime Minister,  Mr Menzies,  later  Sir Robert  Menzies, who himself is, of course, a distinguished lawyer, were the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, and a former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird on 2 November is reported in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ as having said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish I had time available to me to talk about the excellent work being done by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird’s work is not being helped by the kind of undisciplined remarks in which the honourable member for Wannon has been engaging this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labour totally ignores the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird’s recommendation, that the men return to work applied to all jobs under dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird said, as reported in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ on 2 November and quoted by the Minister for Labour and the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser):   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he has an even greater responsibility to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to all sections of the building industry, both employer and employee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  blatant support of the militant communist Mundey, in the face of the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird, only discredits him and his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the guillotine, as it is called, is applied honourable members opposite always scream about the lack of democracy and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently today when they moan about this they should remember that we are giving <span class="highlight">justice</span> as it is deserved and in addition we are giving full and adequate time for discussion on measures on which the people should not be delayed in passing their judgment as to whether or not they should become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more I hear the remarks of lawyers from the other side of the Parliament, the more I agree with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen that they are not only incompetent but also overpaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am a supporter of a Government which realises the problems of the Australian people, a Government to whom the burdened heart may pour forth its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose head is guided by <span class="highlight">justice</span> and whose heart at all times is expanded by benevolence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with established practice, provision of supplementary grants to universities is included to meet the costs of academic salary increases from 1 January 1973 as a consequence of recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell and to allow for salary increases due to the national wage case decision in May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who preceded me in this debate, has informed us that in the United States case, Wesbury v. Sanders (1964) the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of that country, Earl Warren - a man more noted for his political judgments than his knowledge of jurisprudence, as will become obvious - ruled that the relevant part of this Article should be interpreted as meaning that in United States Congressional elections - to use his own words - one man’s vote in a Congressional election (in the  United  States) is to be worth as much as anothers’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember that comments were made by BHP on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore’s findings early in the year and again on the findings of the Prices Justification Tribunal last month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless there is no reason at this stage to suggest that the Tribunal is not acting with complete propriety and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An officer shall, if the Minister or the DirectorGeneral so directs, before entering upon his duties, or exercising any powers or functions, under this Act, make before a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace or a Commissioner for Declarations a declaration in accordance with the prescribed form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be necessary for academic reasons - ‘for such things as, for example, Professor Henderson’s inquiry on poverty, which was instituted by the previous Government when I was Minister, or the inquiry on repatriation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, or something like that - for some academic or judicial authority to get statistical information, not personal information, from files. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  associates and my colleagues to whom I refer were the Honourable  Sir Neil  O’sullivan, once AttorneyGeneral; the Honourable  Sir Alexander  Downer a former Minister and later Australian High Commissioner in Britain, and the son of one of the founding fathers of the Constitution; and the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a false presentation, and that presentation should be altered not only in the interests of accuracy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> but also to permit the Australian people to know exactly what is contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I agree with the view on this matter of  Sir Alexander  Downer, the son of one of the founding fathers of the Constitution,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske and the late  Sir Neil  O’Sullivan, a former Attorney-General of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reiteration of base assertions such as ‘Our advisers tell us there is no threat for 15 years’ are too simplistic; they don’t do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the quality of the work contained in these documents where the inflections are expressed with much greater subtlety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given .the regrettably short time for the estimates debate, it is impossible to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to more than a fraction of the Government’s moves in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a comment such as that, which carries an inference - a very heavy inference - that he is impartial, should be unacceptable to all members of this Parliament and members of the Opposition ought to dissociate themselves from such a scurrilous attack upon a <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I do not have the Press cuttings with me at the moment, I know from my own interest in the sinking of the ‘Noongah’ that in his findings on that occasion  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer was most critical of the Royal Australian Air Force for the manner in which it went about searching for survivors from the ‘Noongah’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy who is conducting the inquiry will level criticism at any person, organisation or department which he considers should be criticised in relation to the search for the survivors of the Blythe Star’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 November, some 7 days after the survivors were found, I invited the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to appoint a judge to conduct the Court of Marine Inquiry which I had directed should take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The platform of the Australian Labor Party, on the basis of which this Government attained office, made clear that Labor’s industrial policy places human rights and values first and provides for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere, lt emphasises the right of full employment; real economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>; freedom and security; the right to work in just and favourable conditions; freedom from unemployment and freedom to choose employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the Ministers for Labour considered the adequacy of existing concepts of long service leave and whether there could be portability of service between employers and industries, in the interests of job mobility on the one hand and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the individual employer on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  second point relates to the fact that the Prime Minister, having ‘been the Minister for Foreign Affairs for a short period of time, will know that the recommendation given to me by both the Department of Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs who is now a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the New South Wales Court of Appeal was that a Minister would not be able to visit the People’s Republic of China in a personal capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have long marvelled that in our sophisticated society <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been extended to the area of unemployment benefits being paid to rural producers in drought or natural disaster areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that they will negotiate with common sense for the sake of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and for what is otherwise a good education program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only they can properly develop policies that will assist the progress of national unity, the formation of further land legislation and the evolution of the legal system to marry traditional law with existing concepts of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, once again the Minister expressed the view that before the Commonwealth took a position with regard to land tenure it should await the outcome of the findings of the inquiry into land tenure by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the alternatives - I believe it was suggested to the committee of inquiry being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell - is a system of restricted freehold, which would to some extent curtail the ability of a person who obtains land cheaply to capitalise upon its resale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Schedule 1 of the Bill, incorporates the determination made by the Medical Fees Tribunal under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, for consultations and visits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our program is not one which stems from doctrinaire beliefs but it is one which flows from a sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April the Australian Government announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry into land tenures under the  chairman  ship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also what I have constantly said and I repeat now is that we want to see the expenditure of the Karmel money and, in addition to the expenditure of that money, we wish to see - at an’ estimated total cost of not more than $5m per annum - every Australian child as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and of equity attract to that child- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission, under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else Mitchell, and comprising in addition Professor Russell Mathews and  Mr G.  J. Dusseldorp, has done a magnificent job in producing this its first report within the 6-month period asked by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report presented by the Commission of Inquiry into Land Tenures, under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, and the statement on it made by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren),  are clearly most important statements for the future of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rates should be more in keeping with the market in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to dispossessed owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The small landowner is then in a position of having to decide whether to take a low offer of compensation now or to fight it out in the hope that he will achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the constitutioncompensation on just terms - only to find that the loss in real value in the compensation that is then paid to him more than outweighs the gain that he might have made in getting a higher compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people are to be so mistaken in their view as to fall for the emotional argument and grant prices powers, and if those powers are to be used to stabilise land prices, those who own land which is acquired deserve <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the third point of allowing the Attorney-General to have a discretion which he could not exercise because of our courts but which now can be exercised because the man is out of the jurisdiction of our protecting Australian courts and our protecting Australian system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recall again to honourable members that the member of that Committee who supported the amendment to the Constitution which the Senate now wishes the House of Representatives to abandon were the honourable  Sir Neil  O’Sullivan, a former Attorney-General, the honourable  Sir Alexander  Downer, son of one of the founding fathers of the Australian Constitution, a former Minister and later Australia’s High Commissioner in Britain and the honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske as he now is, all members of the Liberal Party, the honourable David Drummond, a former member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales and  Mr Len  Hamilton, both of the Country Party; and Senators McKenna and Kennelly together with Messrs Calwell, Ward and Pollard - whom I am happy to see in the gallery this afternoon - and myself of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - I hope that the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  will not take it amiss if I express disappointment that he has departed from the views which were espoused 15 years ago by such distinguished colleagues of his as  Sir Neil  O’Sullivan,  Sir Alexander  Downer and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister is not doing himself <span class="highlight">justice</span> when he says: ‘We have a mandate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no element of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that type of classification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a schools commission which is not so established as to be able to look after the interests of such schools but which has powers which enable it to ride roughshod over those who are primarily responsible for such schools, I submit that we will have a situation in which injustice is perpetuated within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure honourable members that I believe that the report presented by those 3 prominent men -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell of the New South Wales Supreme Court, Professor Russell Mathews of the Australian National University and that progressive and enlightened developer  Mr Dusseldorp  - is a social landmark in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the Labor Party to the poor, to the indigent or to the pensioner then I am confounded by that kind of logic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that the Minister should take heart in the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of his cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s health proposals will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> and relief to these men, and I believe that they deserve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to be assured that this is a payment to the individual in moral and distributive <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as part of his payment to social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again if he does not know that the Federal Govern ment can give a lead to the Ministers of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> throughout Australia in an effort at coordination - the Government is always talking about that - and if he does not know that some responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Ministry in this Federal Parliament to try to do something about that which is concerning so many people throughout the Commonwealth, it is nearly time that he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a need for some action and I appeal to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, if the Minister for Science has no sympathy for this matter, to consider the possibility of having some discussion with the Attorney-General with the object of seeing whether it is possible to have some consultation between the Ministers of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because I am concerned about allegations, which appear to have some foundation, of police discrimination against Aboriginals in Redfern, I discussed these reports with  Mr Maddison,  the New South Wales Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, on 9 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a great many drop-outs in the system and it is the responsibility of the Government, to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> at least and to try to bring equity to those who are the drop-outs, such as the pensioners, the people on fixed incomes and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long ago as 1957 no less an authority than the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Owen  Dixon, suggested that this Australian Parliament should establish a national law reform body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Tenth Legal Convention of the Law Council of Australia held in Melborne that year the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reviewing laws to which this Act applies, the Commission will have in view systematic development and reform of the law, including, in particular the modernisation of the law, the elimination of defects in the law, the simplification of the law, and the adoption of new or more effective methods for the administration of the law and the dispensation of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This limitation of time, we were told, was a denial not only of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, decency, democracy and free speech, but also of the rights of generations dead and not yet born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My good friend the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  asked Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir John  Nimmo to inquire into the deficiencies of the scheme and  Sir John  Nimmo has reported on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quite apart from them the advice was given by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir John  Nimmo and it was given by an all-Party committee of the Senate and the deficiencies of the present scheme -  Sir Earle  Page’s scheme of 1952 and so on - are well known to everybody except the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18 April the former Minister for Health, the honourable member for Barker announced the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo’s committee of inquiry into health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of the honorary system and the proper payment of doctors was, of course, one of the 42 positive recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance, under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, which reported to the previous Government in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the honourable member this assurance: I hope in the next few weeks to be able to determine the cases with a view to seeing that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to the migrants and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the occupier does not consent, all that the Authority needs to do is to walk down the corridor, find a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and obtain a warrant to enter that land, notwithstanding any objection at all that the occupier or the owner may have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, it is possible for a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, perhaps not even from the State in which the Authority intends mining, to issue a warrant allowing the Authority to enter land for the purpose of commencing to explore for or carry on operations for the recovery of petroleum or minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace to know whether anyone already has title in the area concerned, or does it not matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, all the Authority has to do to get a warrant is to find a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace - probably in Parliament House - who has never even been to Western Australia, and he will give a warrant for the Authority to enter a particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More specifically, under clauses 43 to 50 of the legislation an act of gazettal and a ratification by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace suffice to enable the Authority to explore for and recover petroleum from a declared area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A signature of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace suffices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A local <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace suffices to authorise a take over of assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It denies the principles of common <span class="highlight">justice</span> and seeks to entrust to a small select group the awesome powers of Commonwealth constitutional authority and public revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, he did not tell the House of the exorbitant profits made by the multi-national organisations that owned and controlled the mines in Chile, and of the events that caused the people of Chile, during the term of the late  Mr Allende,  to take control of the natural resources of the country so that those downtrodden people who had been shockingly exploited over the years in working virtually for peanuts for the benefit of Uncle Sam would receive <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many people who, in the early days when it was dangerous to do so, asserted that every child in this country was entitled to equality and to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever has been the outcome of the negotiations that have gone on, however the members of the Country Party vote tonight, I assert that they will stand by the principle that every child should attract to itself as a matter of right and of equity and of <span class="highlight">justice</span> a per capita payment for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the amendment simply because this is the only way we can see of salvaging something from the Government’s utter refusal to honour its obligations and its promises, and its unwillingness to see that common <span class="highlight">justice</span> is observed in the provision of finance for the benefit of all Australian pupils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will probe it to the end with a view to ensuring that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and that Australian citizenship is recognised wherever Australians go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has nothing to do with the original legislation itself, but it is just cussedness in the way it is being administered that is restricting the success of the scheme and restricting social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some of these ways of being more flexible with the scheme both at the State and at the Federal level are carried out - I have enumerated quite a number of them - I believe there is still hope for this scheme to be a far more successful one to help the industry and to help the growers with social <span class="highlight">justice</span> than it has been up to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can have some sympathy for the Labor Party’s traditional espousal of the principle of one vote one value even though one cannot excuse the Labor Party’s utter lack of understanding of the reasons why this theoretical principle cannot be applied with <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a country like Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he agree that if there is not a full public inquiry into these matters and into the attempts to cover up the real story there must remain a very real suspicion that there has been a conspiracy to mislead the court and the public and to deny the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that opinion Professor Richardson referred to an opinion given by the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nicholas of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly true, as the honourable gentleman has observed at some time past, that at present there is an entrenched provision to prevent disturbing the balance between and among the States in the way to which I have referred, but the opinion offered by the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nicholas was to the effect that by 2 amendments to that section this could be accomplished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This matter was splendidly explained, if I may say so with respect, by the former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, the late  Sir John  Latham, in one of the classic cases on this very point, Graham v. Paterson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States understandably have been concerned as to whether they can make a reference subject to conditions,  Sir John  dealt with this as far back as 1950 when he was the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Embassy has given all the assurances in the world that we do not wish to interrupt the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the hearings in Austria, but we have certainly said, through all the means that are available to us, that the mother and the child should be able to get together and I would hope that the representations that are being made in a continuing way to the Austrian authorities will persuade the Austrian authorities to recognise the rights of this Australian mother in this situation and also to act in the best interests of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the field of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the record has been remarkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of industrial relations, which I head broadly under social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I draw the attention of this House to a salient fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been done very rarely - mainly to put it up on a flat rate basis, which honourable members opposite regarded as <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - Honourable members will recall that on 8 March 1973 I made a statement in the House in which I gave details about the establishment, by the Australian Government, of the national rehabilitation and compensation scheme inquiry, under the chairmanship of the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse, D.F.C., the distinguished New Zealand judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would also like to express my thanks to the New Zealand Government and the New South Wales Government for releasing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares respectively for a further period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am only sorry that your, tolerance and understanding are occasionally mistaken by honourable_members on the other side of the House for weakness and that they are not accorded the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which, in my view, they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the only way to avoid 2 more years of the downward movement of the social and economic standards of this country, to get rid of the confusion and the uncertainty, to restore Australia to a strong path of growth and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> where the poor and the weak can have an increase in living standards which they are not enjoying now, is to have an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  President  of the Commission,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, appealed for order pointing out to the demonstrators that it was utterly impossible for him to continue the hearing while they were interrupting and waving banners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore appealed to the demonstrators in a sensible and rational way to understand the situation that they were creating and to understand the plight of the 4.5 million workers outside the court room who were looking to the Commission for a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party supports it because, with the Liberal Party, it believes that it provides the minimum amount necessary to provide any <span class="highlight">justice</span> for pensioners in the present inflationary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was appointed as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia because he got out of step with  Sir Robert  Menzies in relation to foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I heard an interjection: ‘Remember Barwick’, ls there somebody in this House other than the interjector, who had better identify himself, who says that the appointment of  Sir Garfield  Barwick as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia was not an appointment accepted by every member of this House and by the whole Australian public as a very fine appointment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to supply additional building workers it has fostered apprenticeship, fostered retraining of workers from areas in which redundancies are occurring, fostered a world wide search for tradesmen who can be brought to this country as settlers, fostered an inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird into the issue of permanency which has driven so many skilled building workers out of their field over recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is manifestly not a case of their being unable to afford it, nor in my view are the reasons for the serious short fall in ODA the lack of generosity of the people of the developed world or their indifference to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his second reading speech looks to this new agency which the Bill establishes as developing innovative policies responsive to the needs of economic self-reliance and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I further call upon the Opposition in this Parliament and particularly the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  who at one time was the minister of State for Immigration, to tell us in this Parliament what their reaction is to the advice that has been given to this Government, to the national Parliament and to the nation by the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Knox  - that we should return to the past, that we should discriminate, that we should repeal all the things that have been done to abolish discrimination and put it all back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one looks at the new Swan electorate, at this moment with some 65,506 people, it makes one wonder about the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the service that can be offered to the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I can remember - and I will be interested to hear whether the Minister contradicts what I have to say - if this Bill were passed there would be a right of entry signed by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace - not even from the dis trict concerned - where right of entry was desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An instrument signed by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace would give the Commonwealth Government power of entry into any property, whether it be of a company or an individual’ Having got the right of entry the Bill would then give the Commonwealth Government power to remove practically everything - not just nominated minerals such as iron ore and bauxite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the owner or occupier of that particular area does not agree to the Authority entering upon the property, the Authority may simply, as I have said before, walk down a corridor, find a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, have a warrant signed and the Authority can enter that property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To finalise the reply to the honourable member for Leichhardt, let me say that he referred also to the fact that there had been a rather serious flight of fancy by the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Knox,  in referring to 30,000 illegal entrants in the last 7 months under the easy visa system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill does provide, however, that where a former Governor-General has other pension entitlements payable by Australia or a State or a Territory of Australia the retirement benefit in total shall not exceed that to which a retired Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I say first of all that in the present dispute concerning the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, the union made an application to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke for 4 sets of study leave of about 1 6 weeks each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The union has rejected the decision by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke and wants the full amount for the 4 sets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be interesting to note at this point that when the union made a submission to the Commission which this Government has appointed, it asked only for what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke later gave it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister make urgent representations to the Brazilian Government with a view to negotiating a reciprocal extradition treaty to bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> reputed swindlers such as Barton, Sommers and a well-known Sydney solicitor who are reported to be living in Brazil on the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains from Australian citizens, and to see that they are returned and are tried according to Australian law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The founders of the Constitution obviously recognised the simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the notion that since the Parliament would make laws for the Territories, the citizens of the Territories should have a voice in that Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under clauses 43 to 50 an act of gazettal and a ratification by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace suffice to enable the Authority to explore for and to recover petroleum from a declared area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can do this under clause SO by obtaining a simple authorisation from any <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace may give the authorisation to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the worst of it is what the Authority can do when it gets a warrant from a single <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, without appeal, and can go on to anybody’s land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While some progress has been made in negotiating new extradition treaties it cannot be said that this has kept pace with the increasing mobility of criminals and other fugitives from <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is necessary also to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> be served and that fugitives be apprehended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the Government’s view, after close examination and full discussions with the  Chairman  of the Tribunal, the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, that the provisions in this Bill will greatly increase the effectiveness of the Tribunal in combating inflation and will do so in a manner that will continue to attract the co-operation of the business world at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hughes of the United States Supreme Court made this very point in an opinion he delivered in 1933 in the case of Appalachian Coal Inc. v.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task we face in this Parliament, if we are really concerned to build a democracy, is to find and tread that delicate line which will achieve complete social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all while affording the greatest individual freedom in personal, social and economic affairs consistent with a basic concern for others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the Government’s projected social welfare program offends not only because it affords our poor nothing like effective social <span class="highlight">justice</span> but also because it threatens to turn us into a dependent people coddled and propped up by the state at every turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was brought by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, when he was Attorney-General, to the stage of a Bill being introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal for the Superior Court was originally put forward by the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia when he was AttorneyGeneral and the justification for setting up the Court rested largely on the need to relieve the High Court of most of its single <span class="highlight">justice</span> original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the most important appointment will be that of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is contemplated that, if the Bill is passed by Parliament, an early appointment of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> will be made to enable the first Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to participate in the considerable task of organising the necessary administrative arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the Government, the Opposition is most anxious to ensure that persons who seek to escape the process of <span class="highlight">justice</span> by going abroad are returned to be dealt with in accordance with Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Opposition supports this measure because, in relation to countries like Brazil which take this attitude, it will enable our Government, through the processes of law, to obtain the return of people from other countries where they are hiding from Australian <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I said earlier, we are content to support it because, in addition, it will enable persons who are seeking to avoid <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this country to be returned here but under proper process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do this kind of thing because this is of the nature of what is known as Communist <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is an indication of the enclosing of the world in a smaller compass, brought about by improved transport and communications, that measures of this sort are now desirable, so that when a person flees from <span class="highlight">justice</span> or from the jurisdiction of one particular country he is, in one way or another, more likely to be caught and brought before <span class="highlight">justice</span> pursuant to legislation of this sort and agreements in the form of treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the factors in the economic context which honourable gentlemen might well anticipate we shall be discussing is, say, the conference called by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore for the first full week in August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are determined to make sure that they do receive <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Joske, presiding member of the Full Bench, said in Melbourne yesterday the union - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that a consensus of opinion will arise from the conference which has been convened by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and which has now been brought forward to August because I think that the employers have taken up a fixed position against quarterly cost of living adjustments and I do not believe that the unions are prepared to give the kind of undertaking that I think would be needed for quarterly cost of living adjustments to be introduced across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is no secret that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia, who, as Attorney-General, propounded it, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, who introduced the first Bill into the House, have since expressed/their opposition to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now in such a state of affairs, it would appear natural to endeavour to establish the Courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as independent organs which were neither Commonwealth nor State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a court must have the power to examine the substantial merits of the cases before it, and must have the power to base its decision not only on the terms of so-called free contracts, which are usually forced upon shareholders by managements, but also on equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our present machinery of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has proved to be ineffective, inefficient and totally inadequate in the field of company law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sir Garfield Barwick,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, the former Attorney-General and my very dear friend, Tom Hughes, who was one of the ornaments of the parliamentary institution, did not have to be convinced about it but my honourable friend on that occasion was convinced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That development was described by 5 judges in the High Court in the boilermakers’ case in 1955, led by  Sir Owen  Dixon, then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia and probably the greatest exponent of the common law the world has ever known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With 4 other justices including McTiernan, Fullager and Kitto agreeing with Dixon C.J., he described this as the autochthonous expedient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pointed out that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Queensland,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell had something to say on the point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But neither from the point of view of juristic principle nor from that of the practical and efficient administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> can the division of the Courts into state and federal be regarded as sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer had this terribly complex but fascinating problem, from the point of view of lawyers, which was posed by the fact that the man had been electrocuted in South Australia and that he had been driving a truck, the ladder of which had extended and come in contact with electric wires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The founding fathers foresaw that a time would come when attempts would be made to create in Australia a national system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember the legal convention that was held in 1967 or earlier at which eminent counsel including Watson,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and others - the present Solicitor-General, I think, was one of those present - all pleading that the present division, this cheap autochthonous expedient, be brought to and end or, at least, phased out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I venture to quote what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Holmes said in the Supreme Court of the United States some time in the 1920s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the honourable member and other honourable members opposite that if they are seeking from me not favours but reasonable <span class="highlight">justice</span> let them keep members of the type of the honourable member for Griffith from expressing in this Parliament views which are quite unprincipled, quite inaccurate and quite untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that if he reads the words that were uttered concerning this matter as they are recorded in Hansard he will examine them in the way in which the honourable member for Griffith has presented his case - with a sense of decency, with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, without any venom and without any bitterness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister see any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a man who has been deserted by his wife and who has been left with 4 children to care for receiving no assistance under the social welfare program of the Labor Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not seem any logic or <span class="highlight">justice</span> whatsoever in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They asked me about various social service problems and I put to them that in <span class="highlight">justice</span> one of the great things required was to do something for the supporting father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, when it comes to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play, a line of demarcation must be drawn somewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is ludicrous for the Government to suggest that the presentation of a flat rate of indexation of wages submission to the conference that is to be conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore represents a viable policy for wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague the Minister for Labor and Immigration will be tabling today the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For  5i  years Liberal Party Governments have stalled on this question, which in February 1969 the present Governor-General, as a member of the Australian Industrial Court, Chief Judge Spicer and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers, recommended as matters for urgent consideration by the Australian, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australian and Western Australian governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Overseas Trade received a letter signed by the Australian Council of Churches, Action for World Development and the Roman Catholic Church’s Commission on <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace requesting him to close Australia’s 2 trade commission offices in South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote the Federal Law Reports, Volume 15, the judgment of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Spicer and Justices Smithers and Kerr in the case of Moore v. Doyle, given on 25 February 1969, and in particular I quote from the last paragraph of their Honours’ unanimous judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  whether he could let the House know when legislation flowing from the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney might be before the House because, as we heard earlier this morning, it is an important matter and one that has gone forward for a long while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be bringing in legislation to give effect to the report by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney in the Budget session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Next week another conference is taking place under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore would be much better off without the Minister because then- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what the Minister has said is equivalent to a statement that he himself will not be at the conference to be chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, I think it augers well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be better if this conference were to take place in a free atmosphere where no politicians were present and where the parties concerned, under the chairmanship of a notable  chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, can try to establish a wage fixation system which might give some better chance of industrial peace than that which we now have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seeks industrial peace in this community, but industrial peace based on <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity for all parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was done in a ministerial statement delivered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, as he now is, then Attorney-General of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 21 November 1968  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, as Attorney-General at that time, introduced a Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because the modern capitalist system is not only hopelessly ramshackled, in that it no longer conforms with its own theories, but also on those occasions when it does work it contains no mechanism for ensuring social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the capitalist system as it operates in Australia is incapable of maintaining balance in terms of economic activity and is also incapable of providing social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> without some involvement by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also served was a Statement of Claim and a notice that the Court will be moved before the Right Honourable  Sir Garfield  Barwick, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia at the Court House, Darlinghurst, in the State of New South Wales, on the second day of August 1974 at the hour of 9.45 o’clock in the forenoon or so soon thereafter as counsel can be heard on the hearing of an application on behalf of  Sir Magnus  Cameron Cormack and James Joseph Webster for certain orders listed in the notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, although some commentators have also poured a bucket on these proposals, as the Minister is a fair man, not to say a statesman, would he arrange for these views to be drawn to the attention of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, since presumably only parties to the original wage hearing are in a position to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government wm do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to firms and individuals disadvantaged by Government decisions or other inevitable economic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether I am doing him <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party members were  Sir Neil  O ‘Sullivan;  Sir Alexander  Downer, son of one of the founding fathers of Australia’s Constitution, a Minister, later High Commissioner to Britain;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske; and  Senator Wright-  now one of the opponents of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe, in the words of the great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in 1964- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue surely is based on 2 facts or 2 studies, the first concerning the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the legislation, standing in its own right, and the second concerning the claim of the Government to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister stood up here and lectured us, as he so often does, about democracy and about what that great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Earl Warren said in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, he certainly did not advert to the Supreme Court case of February 1973 involving the State of Virginia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States of America has been quoted today by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his findings in one case in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have consistently said over the 10 years that I have been involved in organisational politics that I believe in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and I believe in electoral equality, as do the majority of Australians, but they need to be implemented with a degree of tolerance and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My memory of that decision is that it certainly upheld that there should be electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and it agreed to the necessity for tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> in any sense of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the position now and it is what honourable members and honourable senators opposite call <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There may be still a few among them who are fair minded and honest in their approach to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that sort of presentation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Senate being allowed to pass judgment on important issues which affect the every-day lives of the people of the Northern Territory when they cannot get a representative in the Senate’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the electoral system is shown in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The men who wrote the Constitution were men of reason, men of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as a matter of arithmetic, what <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be found in these figures: 240,000 Tasmanian voters elect 15 representatives to the national Parliament; 95,000 Canberra voters elect 2 representatives to the national Parliament; and 30,000 Northern Territorians elect one representative to the national Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on equity; it is based on a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>; it will ensure that every person in this community is covered for health insurance purposes; and, most certainly, it is based on a freedom of choice- a freedom to choose the private medical practitioner that one cares to use and a freedom to choose the type of hospital treatment that one cares to draw upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation will improve health care in this country and will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1962  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor brought down a judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my most academic language, I shall rephrase the whole statement and read from the document compiled by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor said, when he found out that he was trying to dodge taxation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was signed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace from anywhere- he might even be from Canberracan issue a warrant allowing the Authority to enter land to explore for or carry on operations for the recovery of minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, without knowing whether the land is occupied, authorises the Authority to prospect or mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mere act of gazettal and ratification by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace is sufficient to allow this Authority to move into and operate in any declared area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No; although the note to the French Government did contain a reference to one matter not included in the Note to the Chinese Government, namely, the further disregard by the government of France of the order of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> dated 22 June 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This pollution was the subject of litigation between the U.S. <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department and the Reserve Mining Company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again, he and his Government agreed readily in January last year’ to make available the services of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse as head of the Australian Government’s committee of inquiry into a national, compensation and rehabilitation scheme.. .There were frequent and cordial discussions between his ministers and mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In tabling the preliminary report I express my appreciation of the quick and effective way in which the Committee, under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey, responded to my request for a preliminary report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7 to have preceded this order of the day, I think, would have been a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> because I think the contents of that order of the day should come as a result of a committee report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the question does arise whether standing order 196 in itself is not an appropriate standing order to retain and whether it does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the problem of pecuniary interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what we are seeking to do is to bring about a situation in which, if one can slightly expand the expression, <span class="highlight">justice</span> can not only be done but also be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Special Minister of State issue a Press statement on academic salaries on 14 July last in which he stated that:  … the Government had agreed that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell would undertake an interim review of salary levels of academic staff in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, when the report was disallowed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell felt it would be improper and inappropriate to proceed with any determination without statutory support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information  of honourable members I table 2 documents relating to the proceedings of Australia against France in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, concerning the prohibition of further atmospheric nuclear tests at the French Pacific test centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April last year,  Dr Cass  and I announced the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope as  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and his Committee deserves the highest praise of this Parliament and all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I join the Minister in congratulating  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and others on the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not a reflection on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a trade union official whom the honourable member for Gippsland implied was involved in this matter- I refer to the Acting Secretary of the Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers Association of Australasia- I seek leave to have incorporated his telegram to me dissociating his union from the alleged involvement in the levies and my reply to him of 9 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government supposedly is concerned with social <span class="highlight">justice</span>- social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to everybody other than the producers of this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, goodness only knows how the Australian Labor Party interprets any of its motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can change the long standing goals that governments of their own political persuasion upheld; they can accept the goals but attempt to attach some special virtue to one particular form of production; or they can accept the goals and the economic reality and take what comes in the light of the position in the market place but ensure at all times that the farming community gets economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will be said, with some <span class="highlight">justice</span>: What about the people who use their vehicles a lot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is a most acceptable concept provided <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to all sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This from the self proclaimed guardians of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the next few minutes and immediately I concluded my speech I wrote out in my own handwriting the statutory declaration and I got a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace to sign it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter which was considered in the late 1950s by a Senate committee and which currently is being considered by a royal commission conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman has asked me whether evidence of indemnity payments- I use his term- arises in any other industries I would extend the terms of reference of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that the House may understand the nature of the industry and the difficulties that were involved in it I want to refer briefly to the judgment of the 3 justices concerned,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Frank! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske says, in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little later in the judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not only  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers in his judgment had things of a similar nature to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Franki throws a slightly different light on some aspects of this particular case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also further evidence in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki ‘s judgment that the unions had demanded other payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of history that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt was prepared to hear those claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, agreed to allow the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird to undertake the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry, however, has since been resumed under the chairmanship of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Elizabeth Evatt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the findings of the Australian Industrial Court, which heard the case of the Master Builders Federation and the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation, in which  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in his findings in the same case  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers said, as reported at page 10: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the deregistration of the union about which we are speaking the High Court of Australia issued a writ against  Her  Honour <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court must be held in contempt in this case by the findings in the case of Australian Iron and Steel Ltd against the Illawarra Deputies and Shotfirers Association that was heard in Banco by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Owen and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Herron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  I was saying, in the case I have just mentioned before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Owen and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Herron in the Banco court it was held in similar circumstances that contempt did apply where pressure was put on - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was absolutely no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this decision because it had the disastrous effect of increasing costs and lowering productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a result of consistent neglect by States which, to do them <span class="highlight">justice</span>, did not have the finance for such huge enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in vain that non-metropolitan Australia looks for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very proud of the fact that we have introduced, after so many years, a social <span class="highlight">justice</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one that gives <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the vast majority of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a good example to show this is a social <span class="highlight">justice</span> Budget I quote, for a start, the $500m restructure of the taxation scales to assist the low and middle income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the social welfare and the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> aspects of this Budget I refer to the great strides that are being made to overcome very important deficiencies in the educational and social welfare needs of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the only sound social <span class="highlight">justice</span> aspect which can possibly be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of that, we accepted this Budget- a Budget of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least it has been prepared to stick to its guns and to bring in a Budget for social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which the honourable member for Fisher laughs at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not want social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, nor do the other members of the Australian Country Party, the representatives of the Pitt Street farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget proposes social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this Budget is evident right through it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our social <span class="highlight">justice</span> program is driving many glaring inequalities into the corners of society and out of existence altogether, lifting the standard of humanity everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Leader of the Opposition said, these tactics were received by the Opposition with acclaim because of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> that was associated with his administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian public is becoming increasingly tired of the Government’s meaningless platitudes about social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was making the point- it is directly related- that the whole basis of the case put by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was an argument of equity or <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government think that by performances such as this it can buy back the confidence lost by people it has betrayed, by putting up the honourable member for Chifley who, among other things, prattled about social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his definition of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> is rampant inflation, crippling interest and record and untold misery I will have nothing to do with that sort of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Fisher and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  referred to the fact that we are calling this Budget a social <span class="highlight">justice</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What better could one do, I suggest, than to appoint  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney assisted by  Mr McGarvie  to study the problem and bring up a solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney,  Mr Sweeney,  Q.C., as he then was, the advocacy was really brilliant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are essentially, and in fact everything, that was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I place on record my deep appreciation of the work that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and  Mr McGarvie  did in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney in his report elaborates on the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Sweeney in his report, which I know everybody has read from cover to cover, goes on to show how the effect of this position could undermine the whole award system of Australia’s industrial relations machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ernest Joske was the father of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske who sat in this House with many of us for a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I think it can be said quite clearly that no Minister in the history of this Parliament has brought more real social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the administration of the portfolio of social services or social security than has the present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the honourable member for Mackellar fought in the same way for social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in his own Cabinet, he was not able to gain, I might say, the support of the Treasury or of his Prime Minister to introduce such benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knew the injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week, in South Australia, a  Mrs Strattnan  sought as a solicitor employed by the Australian Legal Aid Office in Adelaide to bring a case before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sangster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will destroy their dignity, their hopes, their aspirations and their natural desires for the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> about which this Labor Government preaches but which in effect it denies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear them talk about the Budget being a social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and welfare Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, in fact, has not been trained for the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell has exhibited no knowledge of such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some very famous people have preceded  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell in that position, especially during the last decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell will have to depend upon others for his advice and for his determinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto the Australian States could always rest assured that no matter what happened there was an opportunity to appeal to the Commission for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and for the application of the principle of equality, which has been better preserved in various parts of Australia than in any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that quite clearly and obviously the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMichell as  Chairman  of the Grants Commission places at risk the position of States such as Queensland and South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to pay tribute to the work of the  Chairman  of the Committee of Inquiry, the Right Honourable  Sir Owen  Woodhouse, D.S.C., of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and to his learned colleague, the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  C. L. D. Meares, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who is also  Chairman  of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These remedies have an important place in the history of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but they are both inadequate and unnecessarily expensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting and relevant to note that both  Sir Owen  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares are outstanding representatives of a judiciary founded upon our English common law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal will consist of only one man, the  Chairman  of the Remuneration Tribunal itself,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, but assessors can be appointed, as they have been appointed in the past, and the procedure will be the same as for the full Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most recent case was the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell by the previous Government in September 1972 to conduct an inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in July the Government asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell to proceed with an interim inquiry pending the legislation being changed to provide for the permanent machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that, I can well understand  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell wondering whether he ought to proceed with his interim review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this doubt the Government decided early in September to give  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell statutory backing and to advance this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, when the report was disallowed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell felt it would be improper and inappropriate to proceed with any determination without statutory support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell’s report of last year has fixed up the situation to a certain extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could point out to the House that the commencing salary for a tutor-demonstrator, as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell last year, was $5,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I hope that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell will proceed rapidly with an inquiry and that the Government will encourage him to do that, even if the Government discourages him from bringing in any recommendations about professors and readers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the BUI be passed as quickly as possible because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell cannot go ahead until the Bill receives royal assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this way, it may be possible for the Treasurer and his advisers to introduce a Budget the provisions of which would contain some semblance of sanity, responsibility and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because we have not that power we have had to pursue the process by means of the conference of unions and employers before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conference declares that co-existent with action by the Government along the above lines, the objective of the trade union movement to secure wage and salary <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be pursued in the following manner <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great objective of the Labor movement was social <span class="highlight">justice</span> based on the freedom of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it that he was asked to lead a team of inquiry to advise the Labor Party when it came to office 18 months or so ago about what was wrong with the spending patterns in terms of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity and about what was wrong with them as they had been laid down by the previous Goverment the conservative government- so that we could put the priorities right and so that we could do what I heard and what we all heard the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  say with pride in his voice that we have done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was it this desire that prompted his Government to commence proceedings against France in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to ban nuclear testing in the atmosphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I only hope that we give  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo some guidance in what we have already done in introducing this $2m subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo has gone overseas to study freight rates on the shipping service from mainland Great Britain to Ireland for the purpose of writing into his report what other countries are doing in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the reported statement of the Federal Vice  President  of the Transport Workers’ Union,  Mr D.  Carpenter, in the ‘Canberra Times’ of 7.8.74, referring to a decision of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as a powder-puff decision by a powder-puff judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there is evidence of consistency in relation to <span class="highlight">justice</span> in education and equity in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not believe in equity or <span class="highlight">justice</span> either in taxation or in the equality of opportunity in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to preserve inequality and injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflict involved the now famous, or infamous, Moore and Doyle case in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, then  Mr Sweeney,  Q.C., appeared for some part of the Transport Workers Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead he appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, and we have as a result the report of the committee of inquiry into co-ordinated industrial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot by itself, and the Minister knows that it cannot by itself;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney also knows that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister were prepared to take 3, 4 or 5 weeks off to try to get agreement between the States, to get the necessary commitments from his friends in the Builders Labourers Federation and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, maybe he would get them to take the necessary voluntary action which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney says they would need to take before effect could be given to these provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullager in the Hursey case some years ago, which is also partly quoted in the Sweeney report, might seem to indicate that clause 8, which seeks to amend section 139, could be of some doubtful constitutional validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that, in a sense, this is a fake provision because the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullager would seem to indicate that no State law could modify a law passed properly by this Parliament and in accordance with this Parliament’s constitutional provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is on record as having said that it may be granted that a dispute solely between 2 registered organisations of employees, each of which is able by its own constitution to have members who follow the same trade or calling, as to which of them should be entitled to represent and protect the industrial interests of persons following that trade or calling, would not be an industrial dispute within the statutory definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probable that the proposals of the working party as outlined in paragraph 15 on page 18 would have been simpler than the proposals which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney has put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that that would lead to some real problems because on page 43 of the copy of the report I have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney refersthere was no mention of this by the Minister- to the problems of not being able to sue the nonincorporated State branch of a Federal organisation by naming the secretary as the person to be sued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney says that this position can be met by the State machinery requiring as a condition of registration of a Federal branch that the organisation enter into a deed undertaking to pay to the industrial registrar- I believe that this would be the Federal industrial registrar- any penalty imposed in respect of a strike or lockout under the State Act and remaining unpaid for a period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case the whole system of non-incorporated State registration proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney falls absolutely to the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney on page 40 of the report to which I have referred points out 9 areas where substantial State legislation would be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again hinges on whether or not the rules for eligibility have to be the same and identical in each State and that also is open to that interpretation as can be seen from the <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words in place thereof: the House is of opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with until the Minister informs the House- (a) whether or not the Trade Unions would accept the conditions for non-incorporated registration of State branches as laid down by the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and (b) of the position of the States concerning proposed complementary legislation. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, its report was substantiated by  Mr McGarvie,  Q.C, the very person to whom the Minister turned when he appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it happens,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney came to much the same conclusions as the working party came to, but what is important is that the people who have to make the system work ought to have before them a package of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney is satisfied that his recommendations do not offend the Constitution, we would all feel on safer ground if the 4 States agreed that this was so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, in fact, at page 16 of his report recommended the solution adopted by this Bill, but it is surely relevant that this Parliament be sure that the New South Wales Parliament will pass complementary legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 2 1 of his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have in this Bill is the option being exercised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney without there being any indication from the States that they are prepared to follow the same option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 28 of his report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the same page of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s report, at paragraph 4, he highlights the need for more than mere complementary legislation by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made quite clear to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney in the course of his inquiry that in a number of cases persons who were not employers, for example, persons conducting their own businesses but not having employees, were enrolled as members of employer organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney mentioned that there was an urgent need for persons engaged in business, particularly those who were engaged in small businesses but who were not employers, that is, the business was so small that they did not employ people, to have representation and the benefit of representation in matters such as prices, tariffs, customs duties and various other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment was included in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s draft amendment to the Act and reference to it will be seen, if honourable members care to look, at page 50 of the Sweeney report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Registrar is to have this power which really allows the protection in the funding proposals of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney to be overridden at the discretion of the Registrar, an alternative approach could well be for an appeal to be allowed to the appropriate tribunal concerning the Registrar’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney for non-incorporated registration would fall down entirely, as the Minister has admitted, if the trade union movement is not prepared to accept this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be better able to know whether this legislation would then have effect or whether the House, the Minister and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney have been wasting their time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ambiguous from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s statement, whether he was referring to a State registrar or a Federal registrar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would also suggest in relation to clause 5 of the Bill that while the proposals seem reasonably clear the way  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney has drafted them, and while in reading the clause it might appear that there will therefore be no problems, it is my understanding that the federally incorporated body is the only one that can in fact own property and that there could well be, as opposed to having a fund under the - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may enter into this fascinating debate, I notice that if one looks at Schedule C to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney this amendment is not suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  O’Connor said of section  58,  the predecessor to section  136: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view which  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney holds closely to and which  Mr McGarvie  Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon I referred to an opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> which casts some doubt on this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as well also to refer to a passage from the case of Moore v. Doyle, which is reported in the Federal Law Reports, volume 15 at page 119, and which is also recorded in the report of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney set out from that judgment passages to which I will not refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I observe from reading the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, starting from page 28, under the chapter heading ‘Solution Proposed to the Present Problems’, that this is precisely the way in which he sees the solution to Moore and Doyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from holding a wide range of public positions, including presidency of the Council of the Library of New South Wales, membership of the Archives Authority and the Library Board in New South Wales and  Deputy  Chancellor of Macquarie University,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell is also  President  of the Royal Australian Historical Society and Vice-Chairman of St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Lilley also said that he thinks that, as a result of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell Queensland, as a claimant State to the Grants Commission, is going to suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the reports with which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell has been particularly associated- the one on land tenure which was tabled in this House in November 1973 and the one of the royal commission into local government ratingand if one takes into account his other skills and appointments as well as his position on the Federal-State financial relations body, and if one also takes into account that the Grants Commission has had its charter amplified considerably by the Labor Government to incorporate the making of topping-up grants to local government, I think one must come to the conclusion that his appointment is eminently suitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right to strike is one of the prized and protected rights of the Australian worker, but only when negotiations have failed and there are no other weapons open to the worker to pursue the <span class="highlight">justice</span> he seeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is concerned with a case in South Australia in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sangster has held that as the lawyer concerned was not acting as a principal on behalf of the applicant in the sense of being entitled to receive or retain any fees for her attendance because she was being paid by the Australian Government she had no right of audience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members who read the ‘National Times’ 2 weeks ago and read the current issue will have noted an article written by  Mr Staples,  barrister-at-law in Sydney, who made certain accusations against the <span class="highlight">justice</span> system in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a reply from  Mr Maddison,  who is Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note here that this was taken by  Mr Maddison  to be a reply to a considerate case dealing with the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the State of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be relevant to state here, because I was on the Council for Civil Liberties in New South Wales since its inception until last year, that the New South Wales Government has seen fit to appoint at least 3 members of that Council- just quickly I shall recall them by name:  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Holland and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Martin- to very high judicial offices in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was pleased when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jacobs was appointed to the High Court during the last year, I think it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has produced a climate in the Pacific in which political, social and economic advancement (including ideals of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and democracy) has been able to take place undisturbed and unhindered by pre-occupations with security problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell will replace  Sir Leslie  as  Chairman  of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new  chairman  is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, there is some validity in saying that the reasons should be made available if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would think that that test would be too severe for <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I see no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the fact that a man who died of a heart attack 5 minutes after returning home would not be covered by compensation but if he had died from the same complaint 5 minutes earlier while on his way home from work he would be covered by workers compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a boy or young man who sustains some injury playing football and who becomes a paraplegic or a quadraplegic- all of us have known examples of this happeninggetting no compensation whereas a young man who arrives at work virtually drunk and who, because of his own indiscretions, injures himself and becomes a paraplegic or a quadriplegic would be covered by workers compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present system there are delays - sometimes inordinate delays- in people seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would look at that as being some additional punishment that one has to suffer to get <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not happy about the large amounts that go in legal fees in the course of people seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> in compensation for injury or sickness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if we say that we are concerned in this country about the human race, in a person born with some hideous congenital disability not being compensated for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the elimination of the right to receive lump sums of money in certain cases bring <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any supporter of the Government who claims that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that provision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse has suggested that it will cost a minimum of $ 1,600m when in full operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in New Zealand, which is the country from which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse came and in which he acquire  i  his knowledge of this subject, provides a very good example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse headed a royal commission into compensation in that country in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was appointed to conduct the inquiry in Australia in about April 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government- I understand it does- intend to press ahead with its Australian Government insurance office and move into general insurance and life assurance in a way in which I believe it is actually happening in New Zealand so that instead of this proposition being a social <span class="highlight">justice</span> measure it is a blind for a general take-over of the insurance industry in total? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As of Monday night most of the people there- leading people in the Australian insurance industry- had not been able to obtain a copy of the third volume of the Woodhouse Committee’s report, which is most important from their point of view, to see how accurate were the figures presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse has suggested a 10c a gallon levy on petrol to replace the third party component and a 2 per cent levy on the wages bills of employers and a 2 per cent levy on incomes of the selfemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague from Hawker pointed out,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse made no mention of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not fail to overlook the necessity for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in its implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> by ourselves in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse at paragraph 32 of the report made this observation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, the fact that those submissions were heard by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares does not mean that some submissions should not still be made to parliamentarians because I would hope that our attitude is different from, or at least is not necessarily the same, as that of lawyers or judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 163 overseas experts who were examined by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares and members of the research staff in a large number of countries- 4 in Austria, 23 in Canada, 6 in the Federal Republic of Germany, one each in Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, 39 in New Zealand, 40 in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well remember the now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia going around Australia getting opinions, attending public meetings, receiving submissions and sifting through all of the evidence and material on that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is meant by ‘<span class="highlight">justice</span>’ in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is <span class="highlight">justice</span> measured in a case like this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fundamental measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this scheme as compared with what people may already receive at common law or by way of workers compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">justice</span> surely in large measure is what the injured or sick person will receive at the hands of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in very significant areas an absence of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the sense that what people will receive under this scheme will be less than they can receive at law at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House is to do this Bill <span class="highlight">justice</span> it will take many hours and perhaps days to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is some of the most important and far-reaching legislation that we have ever had and we cannot, injustice to ourselves, rush it through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, who also had experience of the New Zealand precedent, and the other was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, one of the most experienced lawyers one could find. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real issue is this: The Minister for Repatriation and Compensation encouraged  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse to speak to members of the Opposition who were interested in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Well, the honourable member for Moreton asked what it meant and what it meant is this: When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse met  Senator Greenwood  and others who were interested in the matter, including the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  some time ago I imagine that these matters would have been discussed in a cool, impartial atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse met IS members of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party Welfare Committee some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 52 under the heading of ‘ Wildlife and National Parks’, which comes under section 7, ‘Culture and Recreation’, an amount totalling $9.9m, including $9m to the States, has been set aside for the acquisition of land for nature conservation; a further $8m has been set aside to help the States preserve the national estate in accordance with the recommendation, I suppose, of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister should take note of that, because he would do himself a great deal of <span class="highlight">justice</span> if this was given some prominence and he would also do some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government seeks to give effect to its policies of greater social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, more expenditure of money on education and increased spending on welfare and social services, within the constitutional framework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission, known as the Karmel Committee, freely acknowledged that it could not do full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all the ramifications of the problem of special education in the 5 months it had available for the preparation of its report and recommendations for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am asking for is that every effort be made as quickly as possible to ensure that a better system is introduced so that we can get to the stage where even if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done to the person concerned- and I accept the fact- <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government should consider allowing some degree of flexibility so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They include growth centres such as that to be administered by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation; the Cities Commission; area improvement programs; the regional groupings of local government; the Glebe renewal project; the Rocks project; land commissions to develop and stabilise the price of housing sites; the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell into land tenures; the national sewerage backlog reductions program for which $30m was provided in 1973-74 and for which $103m is provided in the current Budget; the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope into the national estate; the Grants Commission; and the national program for urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most overt political appointment of the lot was the appointment of the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, who was becoming a threat to the then Prime Minister, who felt that his own position was in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those remarks were made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has also actively promoted the cessation of nuclear testing through bilateral representations, through its activities in the United Nations and through the action it has taken in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against French testing in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What <span class="highlight">justice</span> or reason is there in that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the public would be satisfied not only that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done but also that <span class="highlight">justice</span> appeared to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it is the basis of all <span class="highlight">justice</span> that if individuals or individuals and governments cannot agree on a matter then there is always a supreme court or, finally, the High Court available to settle the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To think that some person on the authority of the Minister can go all over another person’s land and value it and that that person in the event of not being satisfied with the valuation has no right of appeal is, we believe, intolerable and not consistent with British <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The anonymity of discussions in the jury room is something that is essentially basic to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia and comes to us through tradition from the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward presented his second report in May of this year, and the Government accepted its recommendations in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward suggested that such funds should be seen as providing compensation in the form of useful land to those Aborigines who have lost their lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope they speed through both Houses and become law in this country as quickly as possible because democracy is based on the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of systems such as the electoral system and this is far more just than any previous system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the reason for their exclusion and the Government’s wish to race this Bill through the House in the guise of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is really electoral advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  has already categorised the electoral injustices of the first past the post system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To compel people to vote and then to reduce their opportunities for casting their votes is, I think, an extremely odd form of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s belief in social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which has been demonstrated by massive inputs to our social welfare program, opens up the possibility of programs such as this leading to a diminution of the problem through the rehabilitation of this group of the socially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally,  Mr Speaker,  may I ask you whether you will accept my assurance that, whereas the honourable member for Mackellar seeks nothing but <span class="highlight">justice</span> for himself in this matter I, in the final result, ask you whether you will entertain on his behalf clemency for Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister assure the House that if there are unusual circumstances surrounding any particular member of staff, perhaps that matter might be referred to the Royal Commission now inquiring into security and to which he has appointed  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, currently to inquire? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has adopted the principle, and much has been made of it in this House in relation to the Industries Assistance Commission, that in granting assistance to industry there must be public investigation, inquiry and report so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and seen to be done in the public arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An objective test has to be applied to decide that on reasonable grounds a person cannot be expected to live with the other party, and the ground rules establishing the grounds must be based on fairness, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the object of saving the marriage rather than destroying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is common agreement across society that any law affecting marriage, divorce and the family should meet 2 fundamental standards: Firstly, it should strengthen, rather than weaken, the stability, integrity, and happiness of marriage and family life; and, secondly, where the misfortune of dissolution of marriage does occur, the law and its administration should ensure that divorce proceeds with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all parties, and with safeguards to the dignity and due privacy of all concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that if that clause were adopted there would be a general ground of irretrievable breakdown that could meet the injustice to which I and previous speakers have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that it is a qualitative and subjective judgment that each of us must make on this matter, but I do not feel that the provision of one year’s separation does sufficient <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the institution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third thing is that the injunction proceedings, because they must become so crucial in getting any <span class="highlight">justice</span> done under the terms of an unjust Bill, will be the downfall of any effort to get the costliness out of matrimonial causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill finishes a movement which was begun some 8 years ago by a distinguished colleague of mine, the then honourable and learned member for Parramatta now the Chief Judge in Equity in New South Wales,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking in this House in 1967 at the dispatch box, close now to the elbow of my friend the honourable and learned Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby), His  Honour <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bowen in a ministerial statement which was the commencing movement now to be culminated in this Bill said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The story is attributed to one of the founders of the Australian Constitution,  Sir Josiah  Symon, that Lord Westbury one day encountered  Sir William  Earl, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Common Pleas in London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No person, no man, no woman, can go before that court fearful that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will not be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a situation could complicate the operation of law in this country and militate against the effective administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as CommonwealthState matters are concerned, I think this matter needs to be seen in the light of the recent appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy and in the light of the continued suspicion- a natural and justified suspicion- by the States of the abuse and exercise of centralised power by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make the final point that it is also rather strange that only last Tuesday in this Parliament the Prime Minister, in his statement to the House, made a comment pertaining to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should know that I took advantage of my visit to The Hague- the city in which the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is based- to refer our warm support for the principles and objectives of the International Court and to give greater attention to the Court as an instrument for world peace and harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, some small steps were taken in this direction by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen in 1968 when he was the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He used the same argument in respect of the abolition of appeals from both those jurisdictions, speaking, as the honourable member for Bennolong  (Mr Howard)  has mentioned, about the flowering of the Common Law, how its growth may be stunted in Australia if these appeals to the Privy Council are maintained, speaking in high terms of the eminence of the High Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the Common Law jurisdictions of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In this adjournment debate I should like to raise the matter of the propriety of the appointment of the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as he now is, to the High Court of Australia, and also the matter of the propriety of the decision by the Government of New South Wales in respect of the appointment of a person to fill the casual vacancy created by the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to that ‘Address to the Nation’ particularly because the Prime Minister called in aid his concept of democracy and his concept of what the Constitution of Australia required in the filling of this casual vacancy created by the elevation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take first the appointment of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appointments of justices to the High Court are by the GovernorGeneral of Australia in Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it was on the Government’s advice that the Governor-General appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, whatever the private or political opinions of members of the Opposition or the people of Australia as to the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy to the High Court, whatever might be the private or political opinions as to what the Government of New South Wales proposes to do, no criticism can be made of either of those acts in terms of the Constitution of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the limited time left I say that  Mr Tom  Lewis has every reason to be frightened at the appointment to the High Court of ex-Senator Murphy, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General of the day, who it might be worth noting is now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>- not the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, but a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court; I hope that the other step never eventuates- just washed his hands of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I remember correctly, he made the comment that he hopes that that judge never becomes the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell the honourable gentleman, in passing, that that judge of the High Court probably has more chance of becoming the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia than the honourable member has of becoming Prime Minister of Australia, although the honourable member is working at that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little further we find that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson asked this question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a question from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore,  Chairman  of the Conference, as to whether the Conference saw any practical problems in allowing agreements to continue until replaced- as opposed to the provisions in this Bill- employer and employee representatives saw no difficulties in so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Last night during debate on the motion that the House adjourn I spoke of the constitutional propriety of the appointment by the Governor-General of Australia on the advice of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also spoke of the constitutional propriety of the proposal of the Government of New South Wales to act in accordance with the requirements of section 15 of the Constitution in having a joint sitting of the 2 Houses of the New South Wales Parliament to select a person to fill the casual vacancy created by the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same context the Prime Minister referred to the fact that this century 12 English AttorneysGeneral had been appointed Lords-Chancellor, Lords-Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or a Lord- <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in an article in today’s edition of the Sydney ‘Sun’  Sir Mellis  Napier, former Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia and former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the South Australian Supreme Court, is quoted as saying that the appointment of a judge to the High Court ought not to be treated as a matter of political expediency but as a question in which the whole of Australia had a keen and vital interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally matters of this kind are not permitted to be said in this Parliament against a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation is that many months ago the industry asked for money to be made available on commercial terms, but at the present time what the industry is requesting- and what we on this side of the House submit it is entitled to- in strict <span class="highlight">justice</span> and in distributive justiceis at least $50m initally, with more to come, depending on the way the situation progresses and on the way the season develops, at a rate of interest consistent with the predicament in which it finds itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether any of the 4 States have acted on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s recommendations for meeting the situation, which were included in his report tabled on 1 August last, and whether any of them have passed legislation to complement the Act passed by this Parliament 4 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disturbing and deplorable that no Liberal or Country Party Government has yet introduced any measures which the Industrial Court 6 years ago said were urgently needed and which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney drafted 7 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, a year ago the Government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise to compliment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, the AttorneyGeneral, and the Government for the introduction of this comprehensive Corporations and Securities Industry Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, where is the sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, if the evidentiary provisions of the law militate against a successful prosecution, I wonder whether it is proposed by the South Australian Government to amend the aw so that future public frauds can be brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has to abide by rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One was the former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria,  Sir Edmund  Herring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edmund  Herring’s retirement  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke, a returned soldier and a member of the Victorian Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be said and repeated that British <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires a man to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Government has been told by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as he now is, that the Australian Government will co-operate fully with the British Govenment in extradition proceedings, even to the point that contrary to general tradition if a first application for extradition failed the Australian Government would not raise any veto against a subsequent application or applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a situation of conflict of that sort, with its obvious breach of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the prerogative writs obviously would be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I read the language of clauses 40, 41, 42 and 43, a situation is being created that is consistent with the best principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That measure, when it comes in, will seek to give effect to the recommendations of the Bland Committee report on the best way in.which to achieve- dare I use the word- <span class="highlight">justice</span> in situations of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger of it, of course, is not that they abuse their position sometimes; the danger is that they are sometimes seen to be abusing their position, that <span class="highlight">justice</span> just is not seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This search warrant can be secured by making application to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way whatsoever do I seek to reflect upon probably one of the oldest judicial offices known to our system of law, but to be able to secure a search warrant in these circumstances from a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace is something from which I must confess, instinctively, I resile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have obtained it from the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a code offends my sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and compassion . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As was observed, from the place where the present Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  sits at the table, by one of his most distinguished predecessors, the now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, a very great Australian and a very great judge, when he introduced the Matrimonial Causes Bill, now the Act 1959-1 can recall him standing at that dispatch box and saying: ‘It is not of the nature of human nature to have the saintliness of Hosea’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If divorce is recognised in our society, the responsibility of lawmakers must be to devise and place on statute the means whereby such breakdowns are dealt with in terms of human dignity and common <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I ask: Is there any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a situation like that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a community, does our philosophy of life take into account that, above all others, children require <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that so many children are the victims of irreversible injustice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That being so, that it would also serve <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a goodly number of cases should prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 17 November 1960 his words as recorded in Hansard, referring to the then Attorney-General, now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Mr Barwick,  as he then was, were a truculent runt’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just cannot see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let that be said in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is helpful to go back over the salaries of justices of the High Court since 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 14 June 1969 the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court was altered from $24,000 a year to $30,000 a year and the salary of justices of the High Court from $2 1 ,000 to $27,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 April 1973 the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was altered from $30,000 to $39,000 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the same date the salary of justices was altered from $27,000 to $35,300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this measure the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> ‘s salary will be altered from $39,000 to $45,000 and the salary of justices from from $35,000 to $41,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first one is this: At 14 June 1969 the salary of a High Court <span class="highlight">justice</span> was $21,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the salary of a High Court <span class="highlight">justice</span> was less than that of a departmental head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In 1973 the Remuneration Tribunals Act was passed following the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, which was delivered towards the end of 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Chairman  of the Expert Group,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares, summed up the position very well when speaking recently in Albury-Wodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill itself recognises this in clause 75(2 )(n) which provides that in respect of maintenance the court must take into account any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, on balance, the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, dignity and happiness will be better served by the new legislation than by clinging to the discredited and defective status quo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 2 views on it- the view expressed in the 1930s by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt and  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTeirnan in the celebrated case of Burgess in which they expressed the view that if government enters into an international agreement or signs a convention and it is a proper matter for signature and for government ratification, then it can be received into municipal law even though there is not a clear head of power and beyond that and more importantly, even though it finds itself in conflict with other aspects or provisions in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Having just listened to about half an hour of verbosity from the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who sits opposite, I state that I still have no possible explanation of why he is really opposed to this legislation except to conclude that what he really seeks is to perpetuate in this country the existing situation in which people can and do commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span> for committing these acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This portion of the Bill enshrines in our law the principle to which all of us in this House adherethat an Englishman’s home is his castle or, if I can transpose that, that an Australian’s home is his castle- that no-one can enter a person’s home without a warrant, in accordance with the appropriate State legislation, approved by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace which suggests that some person who is wanted for a particular crime is there or that there is something that appertains to that dwelling which suggests that a breach of the peace is about to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one were to look at the Queensland Aborigines Act of 1 97 1 or the Torres Strait Islanders Act of 1971 and the regulations made under them one would think that they provide an eminently sensible system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one lived on an island in the Torres Strait or an isolated reserve in the Cape York Peninsula or elsewhere one’s access to <span class="highlight">justice</span> depended on the extent to which the manager of the reserve would facilitate transport and the like for one to appeal to the visiting magistrate or to some other authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But having failed to do that, there is a responsibility on every decent person in this region to try to ensure that representatives of international agencies, representatives of the United Nations, representatives of governments of this area are in those towns that are being taken over by communist aggression to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done to innocent people; not to soldiers, not to those who chose to- go out and fight on the battlefield, but to the women and children who are suffering the great consequences of this conflict in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, therefore, I have a predisposition to say that in a country with 6 States where, from the very beginning, there have been inefficiencies and a strange disposition to want to be different, even though it might cause costs to rise and transport and other facilities between the States to be obstructed in some way, there should be an interstate commission to ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span> and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those circumstances are brought about and if an amendment which will exclude from the consideration of the Commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell the payments made under the National Health Act is not proceeded with, what guarantees can be given so that the $ 10m to $30m- that is the amount of the various calculationsof the grant to the remaining claimant State will not be surrendered; in other words that the grant  will  not go  into  one pocket this year and be taken out of that pocket in 18 months time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Before the debate was adjourned last night I listened with interest to the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  when he discussed the 3 provisions of this fairly short Grants Commission Bill which seeks to increase the number of fulltime members of the Grants Commission, particularly in relation to the local government division, to establish a status for the existing  Chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, and to incorporate some machinery changes in relation to the Remuneration Tribunals Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the period that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell served on this court he excelled as a man who had a great knowledge of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the concern of the honourable member for Lilley that an accountant should have been appointed to the Grants Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell was chosen by the Liberal Government in New South Wales for this position on this royal commission to do what one might think an accountant ought to have been appointed to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, it would be very difficult to find any other person in Australia who is more suitable and capable than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell to do the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that there is a necessity to recognise that if we are to appoint people of the calibre of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell to positions like this to carry out impartial and appropriate inquiries into the needs of local government we have to acknowledge their position in the community and establish them so that they hold the position they previously enjoyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is only fitting that this be done in this instance to accommodate  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell and in future other judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was especially pleased last October when the announcement was made that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell, who had been a judge of the Land and Valuation Court of New South Wales since 1 962, had accepted appointment as the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission for the ensuing 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell is a man with a deep understanding of, and a long experience in, the field of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This use of loan funds by councils in their borrowing position was highlighted by the  Chairman  of the Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, during hearings at Cessnock, when considering applications from the Hunter region just a few weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Shortland spoke of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell’s royal commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this particular case the Government accepts that the amendment is not aimed at  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, nor should it be because he is a most qualified person both as a judge and as an investigator of local government needs and reports, and now as a very worthy  chairman  of the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen that the Bill will thus preserve the common informer procedure provided for by the Constitution, while modifying its application in a way that will be more in keeping with modern times and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe we would find in a case like this that the High Court- particularly the Chief Justicewould be anxious to have the matter heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not be surprised if, in the course of making a decision in this case, certain obiter dicta were made by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or by other members of the High Court which would give to present members of this House and to future members of this House some guidance as to what they should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe, if I do not misquote the Minister for Labor and Immigration, that he called the finding of the tribunal chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Coldham a decision that was ‘idiotic’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is based on the premise that mistakes can occur and that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member also drew attention to the other element that must not be forgotten, and the Government certainly does not forget it, namely, the element of what lawyers call natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with the maintenance of confidentiality, one has to make known or to publish representations so that, as I said earlier, the principle of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently in a judgment in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox made some comments on this matter which I think are pertinent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the concentration of power involved is constitutionally unsound, and inimical to the proper administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is, I think, beyond question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Queensland, that alleged backward place we often hear about from honourable members opposite, the role of Attorney-General and Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is one; there is a separate Minister for Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may seem incongruous to raise this alongside an acknowledgment of calls for restraint; but this remains an area that is impossible to ignore with any sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that anything short of that situation would not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to preserving what this Commission should be doing, that is looking after the total balance which is appropriate to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April 1973, the Australian Government set up a committee of inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is supposed to be the government that deals out <span class="highlight">justice</span> to everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that perhaps social <span class="highlight">justice</span> is its strong point, with emphasis on social. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless the Government is meting out injustice to so many thousands of Australian people by abolishing this useful Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My predecessor,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy as he now is, or  Senator Murphy  as he was, was probably the greatest law reformer, the most active and ambitious law reformer, with positive results to show for it, whom this country has ever known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure flows not from any style or way of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy in bringing about the magnificent achievements which he brought about in law reform in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall being rather impressed in the course of the inquiry I mentioned by a draft BUI from the International Commission of Jurists which, amongst other things, provided:  … the  President  and the Court shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by the rules of evidence but, subject to the requirements of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, may inform his or its mind on any matter in such manner as he or it thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mere existence of the right is a palliative to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will inform the official that he is under public scrutiny and that inefficiency, ignorance, slothfulness and injustice can no longer be hidden in the bowels of the Public Service, and that if he errs he will be subjected to public review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But which of us in this House has not in his duties come across the very ignorance, injustice and inefficiency of which I speak? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An imaginary system cunningly planned for the evil purpose of thwarting <span class="highlight">justice</span> and maximising fruitless litigation would copy the major features of these extraordinary remedies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that those days are passing because with the enactment of this Bill a system of rational dispensation of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the first time will be introduced into this unfortunate- one might use the word chaotic- system which we have had for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, detailed legislation in this matter could in many cases inadvertently bind those whose task it will be to apportion compensation to decisions which may not be in keeping with the real interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential that in our redefinition we have an ear not only to the fundamental nature of the institution of marriage but also to the needs and demands of a changing society and to basic principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ground will enable <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done in appropriate cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that honourable members look at clause 114 which provides for wounded parties, in the circumstances which the honourable member for Wentworth described, to seek some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a marriage situation we are concerned as between a fair go and a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the 2 partners to a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless grounds exist which enable a marriage to be terminated as quickly as possible the greatest cruelty and the greatest injustice could be wreaked upon what would otherwise be the innocent party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one has a finely developed sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a developed sense of fair play as between 2 partners, can one ignore that situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that a fair sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge members to accept the viewpoint that the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth seeks to do that so far as it can be done consistent with the requirements of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection I would add that it is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the position of a woman who is, say, being subjected to constant beating and who has come to the point of seeking relief, can be ‘settled’ by an injunction under clause 114 of the Bill, and yet not by the granting of a dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> to assert that an appeal to section 114 will satisfy this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental point that must be considered is that the Bill must give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that if proposed new paragraph (c) is deleted we will debar some members of the community from <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst some people might argue against the likelihood of that happening, I believe that the important point is that there should be <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the proposed amendment sets out what the great majority of the people in Australia would like to see- a responsible and reasonable approach to divorce with <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it appears to me that fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in divorce law ought to give to all parties to the marriage the right to go to the court when it can be shown as a fact that the marriage has broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that clause 48 as it now stands will give maximum <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If intolerable conduct is included as a ground for divorce it will give some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the injured party in any divorce situation, and I think that this is important and should be kept in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan who is well into his eighties is generally loved by his legal colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of permanency has been studied first of all by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird and later by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the conclusion of consideration of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt ‘s report- an interim report, which I have just received- the Government will have to decide whether it is worth while persevering with the inquiry, which has already been through the hands of 2 judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it might be said that clause 75 allows to the court the widest discretion to take into account the particular circumstances of a case and so give <span class="highlight">justice</span> as between the parties, I fear that with clause 72 being the primary clause with respect to maintenance the courts will be guided by the concept or the philosophy that they find explicit in that clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those matters are wide enough in their terms, together with the last consideration which is found in paragraph (n) and which states:  any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be taken into acount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that that would give- if I may put it this way- much better <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the case than the court merely having regard to the eligibility of a person to receive such a pension when that person may, for some reason, not actually receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate looked at this matter with great care and added to the list of matters that the judge shall take into account sub-clause (n), which refers to any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I discuss those propositions in detail, I should say in answer to the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  that, although he is correct in saying that the last paragraph of clause 75 (2) states that the court will consider any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires, it is an open question whether that general advice to a court will override the precise provisions which are contained, for example, in clause 75 (2) (h), and that is a strange provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion ofthe court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> ofthe case requires to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The last paragraph of the clause states:  any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) With reference to his predecessor’s press release of 2 1 December 1974, what are the grounds for the belief that the case Australia put to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> influenced the French Government’s decision to discontinue atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What my distinguished predecessor,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of the High Court, stated was that he believed the case Australia had put to the Court and the injunction granted by the Court in 1973 had influenced the French Government’s decision to discontinue atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To develop further the considerations which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy no doubt had in mind would be to reopen matters of controversy, which, as between Australia and France, are, happily, now resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have no doubt that the initiative which the Australian Government took in 1973, and the vigorous development of that position before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, served as a focal point in the mobilisation of international opinion against French atmospheric testing; and that this factor was one which influenced the French Government in the decision which it took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I would suggest that in considering whether a set of redistribution proposals ought to be accepted this House ought to address its mind to the essential electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the redistribution proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What really matters and what really goes to the essence of the electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> of these proposals is the impact of the proposals on the marginal seats, because it is the marginal seats, and the marginal seats alone, which determine which party holds government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to determine whether there is essential electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in these proposals, you concentrate your attention on the marginal seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Opposition side of the House would submit that something as fundamental as redistribution, something going so much to the essence of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and something which will directly and literally determine which Party governs after the next election ought not go ahead if there is any shred of legal doubt regarding the constitutionality of those proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking a broad national view, I submit there are very substantial reasons of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> why these proposals should all be rejected by this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision was taken to oppose this redistribution on the grounds of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity by the Liberal Party in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we really have to look at in determining whether an electoral distribution is fair is the test of essential electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>; how easily can marginal seats change hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government stands for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Clause 26 is an extraordinary provision to be found in legislation of this kind which is intended to achieve a measure of administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> for citizens whose interests are affected by decisions of pubUc servants of the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more so in the context of legislation which was introduced by the Government with a fanfare of publicity, heralding a great move forward in the field of administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the establishment of this Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of the Committee, I should Uke to quote a passage from a book which I was very interested to read some years ago on this question of administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> is the friend, not the enemy, of good administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All good administrators should take care that the machinery is properly tended and that the lubricant of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is supplied in the right quantity at the right points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But legislation such as this which seeks to establish a structure for achieving administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> by putting a brake on arbitrary power, is itself subject to arbitrary power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a situation is the very denial of administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is seeking to achieve by the amendment put forward, is a large step towards administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> by achieving certainty, at least at this moment, by giving to the Tribunal a jurisdiction which is clear, which is set out in the schedule and which is not subject to a desision at some later time by the public servants whose decisions ought to be capable of being reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that he is a top grade member, but <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity in electoral representation demand that neither he nor any other honourable member should be called upon to represent practically double the quota just to allow the National Country Party to survive with its loaded country electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are these proposals brought into this Parliament, except for the pros and cons and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of them to be debated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, they opted for a marginal short-term political advantage and for a mockery of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the proposals of the Distribution Comissioners for Victoria represent a thorough-going attempt to provide the citizens of that State with electoral boundaries which will go a great distance towards the achievement of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all voters and political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party and National Country Party do not believe in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the cant, humbug and rantings of the National Country Party and its ‘puppet’ Liberal leader cannot destroy the equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the proposals drawn up by Commissioners whose competence and integrity are unchallenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose it because it is based on ground rules which have been changed by this Government in a way that ignores <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that ignores the right of every Australian to enjoy equality of representation in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The related report of the Taxation Review Committee chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  K. W. Asprey will be tabled later this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the very first actions that my Government took- I think I was the Minister at the time for the portfolio concerned- was to ask  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  E. A. Woodward to look into these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No wonder that Lord Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hewart was driven to such a state of utter despair as to write his ‘The New Despotism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surely only <span class="highlight">justice</span> to ensure that no one person bears disproportionately a share of the cost of the preservation of the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the question of compensation as a matter of common <span class="highlight">justice</span> needs to be looked at very closely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, early in the life of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was good enough to hold informal discussions with me so that the work of the 2 committees would not be confused and so that they would be looking at different areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have with me a note from the Western Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government sees the wisdom, and I hope that it sees that it is a matter of natural human <span class="highlight">justice</span> that some provision of this type should be placed in the legislation to protect an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be done to the people acquiring land as well as to those people who own the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if the honourable member was talking about <span class="highlight">justice</span> rather than adopting some sort of cheap expediency, in a time of high inflation there was an even greater need to adjust the pension than at a time of low inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went on to stress that it was not right that pensioners in particular should bear the effects of inflation, and that therefore there was <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the measure, but I pointed out also that there were many other matters to be attended to in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely summarise in this way: These Bills give legislative effect to boundaries for each electorate in Australia which bring equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will now give way to him and let him rant and roar about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, of which the National Country Party knows nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Come what may, ere the night is out these Bills will become the law as far as this House is concerned and the people will know that we as a Government stand for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, irrespective of what those who sit opposite might say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a vested interest in preserving a status quo which utterly vitiates electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First it commits itself to domination by the Country Party but, more important, in the eyes of the Aus.tralian people, it commits itself to the perpetuation of a flagrant breach of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was rather extraordinary that not only the Leader of the House but also the Prime Minister himself fell into the trap of relying on a selective quotation regarding the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of these redistribution proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which to achieve that state of affairs- the electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which constant tribute is paid by the Prime Minister and his Party- is to preserve equity insofar as the marginal seats are concerned, it is marginal seats that determine what parties shall be in government and not seats like Grayndler or Bradfield. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> for which he strives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He believes that democracy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> must end at the city limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property and the Prime Minister seek to divide Australians into warring classes and they have so clearly shown that their Utopian ideal is that civilisation and <span class="highlight">justice</span> end when one leaves city limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is that for sanity or <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are twice as many members of the Liberal Party who sit in this chamber as there are members of the Country Party; yet the Country Party has put so much pressure on the Liberal Party that it has been prepared to bow down without paying any regard to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber may disagree with many of the things for which the Liberal Party stands, but at least we thought it stood for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But above all, the Opposition is opposed to this redistribution because it is essentially unfair according to any reasonable test of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the best I can do is to quote  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs, who said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell in late 1974 these rises were retrospective to 1 6 October 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was removed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and there was a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell as  Chairman  of the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell we have one of the most distinguished members of the New South Wales Bar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  would agree that at the Bar  His  Honour was an outstanding personality, that he was a brilliant student, an excellent advocate and became a first class judge and, having earned all those qualifications, became entitled to the title or designation  ‘Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government thinks that it would be petty and miserable to say that because such a person became  Chairman  of the Grants Commission he could no longer be called ‘  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might say in fairness to  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, who has been in the position of  chairman  for some months now, that he has performed a splendid job in his dealings with local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The converse is true for certain experience and qualifications are welcome and, in the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, his experience and qualifications in his meetings with local government representatives have shown the value of having such a man appointed to this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past I have expressed my views concerning the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell as  Chairman  of the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I argued then that it was worth reflecting for a moment on the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell was being given a title, a status and a position superior to that given to former Chairmen of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think that it does him, or his speech writers, less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to forward the point about Opposition posturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, it proposes for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> a salary of $31,450. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal has been made of the point that this idea was first conceived by  Sir Garfield  Barwick, now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason expounded by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for this court was that it would take away the workload of the original jurisdiction of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now justices like  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, for instance, in New South Wales are exercising what was originally the jurisdiction given to the High Court- the original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have no more of these statements by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and others that this was a court that was conceived and supported by the previous Government, by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real solution in this matter is not to proceed with this court but to attempt basic constitutional reform of the judicature chapter of the Constitution and in the meantime, I suggest, to use what has been referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell, for instance, in an article that he had published in the Federal Law Review, as the autochthonous expedient- the use of the State courts as repositories of Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2243 and the matter raised in this question is within the compass of the Inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope set in train by the present Government as the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-49-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in the Federal courts of this country the only <span class="highlight">justice</span> that can be administered is Federal <span class="highlight">justice</span> and not State <span class="highlight">justice</span> or <span class="highlight">justice</span> in every sense of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt, some financial provisions would be required for levying upon the various Governments contributions to the cost of administering <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1964, just before he became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  wrote a 21 -page article on the proposed new federal superior court for the initial issue of the ‘Federal Law Review’, the journal of the Law School of the Australian National University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 29 October the same year Attorney-General Bowen asked a committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, later Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and now the Governor-General, to consider the jurisdiction to be given to the proposed Commonwealth superior court to review administrative decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other members were SolicitorGeneral Mason, later a judge of appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and now a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, Professor Whitmore and later Solicitor-General Ellicott, now the honourable member for Wentworth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not possible in this debate to argue for or against our present bilateral system of government and its accompanying system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span>, let me repeat that all businesses in Australia today have been hit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that legal order 2 options were available for the handing out of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition takes the view that it would be far better so far as the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the situation is concerned, for the final decision as to whether or not the matter involved fell within those excluding criteria to be given to the Attorney-General who is the principal legal adviser of the Government, the principal law officer of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently there is an increasing likelihood of injustice to individual citizens, and of course injustice even in a minor way is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely trust that the appointment of an Australian ombudsman and the 2  deputy  ombudsmen and the establishment of an Australian Appeals Tribunal will ensure not only that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and is seen to be done but also that what has been described as the delicate path between the rights of individual citizens and harmony in the machinery of government will be clearly and effectively protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian system of administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if I can put it that way, is probably that much worse than the system in comparable countries such as New Zealand, Britain, France, the United States of America and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it goes beyond that and extends to the allocation of houses of one kind or another, and the ombudsman, in company with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, will give a measure of administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> that this country has not had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is very much a time to keep those achievements in mind, to put the record in perspective, to reflect on the basic strength and prosperity of the nation, the underlying strength of the economy, the real gains we have made in social reform and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and in the living standards of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Family Law Bill- a monument to the former AttorneyGeneral, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy- has completely refurbished the marriage and divorce laws of Australia and done away with the medieval concepts of guilt and fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are to do complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the ombudsman process, as well as the administrative appeal process, and if we are to make the ombudsman a person who is established for the specific purpose of being the representative of the public in looking at discretions of a particular quality or character, then those discretions which are vested in Ministers and are administrative in nature ought also to be subject to consideration by an ombudsman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Has the Prime Minister stated that Australia will drop its reservations with respect to the jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, on 26 September 1961 (Hansard, page 1321) I expressed the hope that Australia would provide a lead to other countries by abandoning its qualifications to its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I announced on 14 March this was done by signing and depositing with the Secretary-General of the United Nations a declaration which had the effect of withdrawing Australia ‘s then current declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and of substituting a new declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WHEREAS on the first day of November one thousand nine hundred and forty-five Australia ratified the Charter of the United Nations of which the Statute of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is an integral part; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA hereby WITHDRAWS the said declaration and DECLARES for and on behalf of AUSTRALIA that it recognises as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, in conformity with paragraph 2 of Article 36 of the Statute of the Court, until such time as notice may be given to withdraw this declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New South Wales and Victoria were fairly early off the mark, but I was informed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Queensland only a week or 10 days ago that Queensland does not wish to set up a family court in Queensland but would prefer the Family Court of Australia to operate there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not be more constructive and say: ‘When can we commence to lay the foundation stone of a parliament house that will do <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only to the people of this country but also to those who are honoured to represent them here?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now these days all matters, with a couple of exceptions, are rebates instead of deductions- a very great advance in economic rationality and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ventilate this matter in the hope that Parliament- the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and those who speak for this Parliament on these matterswill seek to stir the States into activity to take a stand in defence of these people who in their closing years deserve <span class="highlight">justice</span> and not burdens of the type that I have illustrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Minister was emboldened to embark upon a course that I can only describe as not doing himself <span class="highlight">justice</span> as a gentleman and as a Minister of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill will ensure that action can be taken under Federal jurisdiction to bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> people who engage in criminal practices of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But since the introduction of this Bill we have received an interim report from the Royal Commission Into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not blame the Government for not covering the appalling situation disclosed by the interim report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney because the report was not available when the legislation was brought down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be intolerable if the practices described by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney were allowed to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney rejects this claim, as the  Wollongong did  not have the capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Matters involved in the Royal Commission into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney is presently conducting have prompted the Opposition to move an amendment during the Committee stage of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of this recession, in spite of the obstruction of the Senate, in spite of the delays and distortions in this House, in spite of the opposition that has been generated by the Opposition parties outside this Parliament, the Australian Government has stood firm and has brought down a Budget that will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> and assistance to all sections of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, for those who believe in the exercise of political rights by all people irrespective of race or creed it is a moment of achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The preservation of the security of Australia as a free and democratic nation and the welfare of the Australian people, promoted through a sound economic policy with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all sections, are the paramount responsibilities of this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be recalled that it was the previous Government that appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to hold this inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest information is that a lot of the papers collected by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose are now ready to be filed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like also to mention  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s interim report on alleged payments to trade unions because this also is important to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have accepted the Budget for what it is, a masterly combination of economic reform and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It conforms basically to a similar resolution debated in the Senate on 12 and 13 February of this year following the disgraceful decision of the Liberal Premier of New South Wales to appoint what he falsely tagged as a ‘political neuter’ to replace retired Labor senator, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, who was appointed to the High Court On that occasion the Senate carried the resolution unanimously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How will a judgment be made with any semblance of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at the inaccuracy of the determination, its uncertainty and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> between those on 84.8 per cent or so, which is just below the margin, and those who are just above the margin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I am pleased to support this Budget because for the first time in over 20 years some <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being afforded under the new personal taxation system to the young married couples with families to raise and to educate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government has a solemn duty to fund part of any communications deficit because those who pay taxes and live outside the metropolitan areas can in all <span class="highlight">justice</span> expect the national government to contribute to their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is also another inherent right which is always observed in every court in this Commonwealth, and every court where there is any reasonable conception of <span class="highlight">justice</span>- that he shall present his case in an atmosphere which shall not have had the effect of prejudging him before he comes in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By his skill, the Treasurer has managed to combine economic necessity and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of these master criminals are able to escape <span class="highlight">justice</span> by skipping the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the only way in which we can ensure that these criminals do not escape Australian <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters are not as simple as that and it is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> when one section of the community tries to index itself at the expense of the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They give no consideration to the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of their claims to certain rights and certain conditions to which they are entitled by reason of the positions they occupy or to the lead they should give the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February 1973  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was appointed to investigate and report on Aboriginal land claims in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 97 1  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn established that, under the law, Aborigines had no legal tenure of land as a traditional right; but no action was taken by the Government at that time to change that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great political <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been applied to the manner in which the Treasury has operated in this Budget, especially in terms of the Medibank system which was opposed by the Opposition and in terms of the taxation concessions which were so much exploited by high income earners over a long period when the present Opposition was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently in the great socialist magazines,  Time  and  Newsweek,  questions have been raised as to the operations of this system and whether the injustices inherent in our society can be overcome within the system under which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote extensively from  Time  magazine because it raises a number of questions as to whether or not political parties in this country will continue to allow the injustices that I refer to and as exposed by the Henderson Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also raises the question as to whether we can continue to watch the Aboriginal people live in poverty and whether we are accurate in our assessment of the cost of Medibank, whether Medibank be a <span class="highlight">justice</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the community of Australia would want Medibank irrespective of the cost because it provides great medical and health <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My god is <span class="highlight">justice</span> for aU the people who live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the society in which we are living at the moment just does not give that <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the outset, there is great <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the political application of what has been done in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the things that have been done by this Government are of great social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That view was expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of the High Court as he now is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion it shows the determination of this Government to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality to our Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most contemporary development, of course, is in respect of the request of some 1 8 or 1 9 lawyers for a royal commission about a number of matters mainly concerning Aboriginal people and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, Aboriginal people and corrective institutions, and Aboriginal people and police relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  in concerning himself with this area would like to echo the words of  Sir John  Latham, a former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia and a former Leader of the Opposition, who when he was asked about the intrusion of the Commonwealth into matters of transport had this to say over 40 years ago: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can give an assurance- that is what I have been asked to do- that the Minister for Agriculture Will certainly administer this legislation when it is enacted with full <span class="highlight">justice</span> and will take into account the provisions of clause 6(1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, illustrates that these provisions have very restricted application in contemporary circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation such as that proposed in this Bill was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in the first report of the Aboriginal Land Rights <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no criticism of the Australian system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, or of the British system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> on which it is based, but the very nature of our courtrooms to one unfamiliar with them immediately puts a defendant or a witness at a marked disadvantage with the magistrate, the judge, the police, Crown prosecutors or the counsel for the defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that legal aid offices strengthen the legal profession because they will provide the means for the scales of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to balance more evenly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member will remember that the first reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission, which is presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, was the need to protect civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is in relation to remarks made in this House about  Senator Murphy,  who is now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, and the second is in relation to the comments of the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  when he spoke about opportunism on the part of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that the same sorts of remarks could be said in regard to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy as were said about the legislation he introduced, the thought behind it, and this statement that he made: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the interjection of the honourable member for Hume, that was said by the then  Senator Murphy,  who is now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, I think that a decision and an opinion of one of our Justices should be given fairly solid consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister satisfied that complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done to the Australian Council of Trade Unions in the finding of the Royal Commission on Petroleum that the ACTU deliberately deceived the Government about the price it was paying for crude oil? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best thing they could do with this $10 would be to give it to the Labor Party where they know they will get <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity and good legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that is necessary in this country is to correct the electoral injustice existing under present electoral boundaries in all States of Australia, in many cases State and Federal boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation will pass through that Parliament because there are people there, even some opposed to Labor, who believe in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no purpose in delaying these measures for an unlimited time to allow a filibuster by honourable members opposite who are determined to stop the legislation irrespective of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of it all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What perhaps some members of the House may not know is that if the proposals submitted to the Distribution Commissioners by the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales- this Party which is so committed to democratic government, which is so committed to one vote one value, which is so committed to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>- were accepted by the Commissioners they would, on the same votes cast in May 1 974, give to the Labor Party in New South Wales 29 seats and not 25 seats and would give to the joint Opposition Parties 16 seats and not 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are only two means by which the electors can get electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Government and the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  are not in the least bit concerned about or interested in fairness, <span class="highlight">justice</span> or real equality of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forget about <span class="highlight">justice</span> and forget about the people’s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> presented a report to the Parliament, but members of the Opposition cannot find out who drew the boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, they opted for a marginal short-term political advantage and for mockery of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Age  said that, which proves that people all over this country have given the National Country Party away so far as electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is concerned but they expected better from the Liberal Party and its high-sounding principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another place  Senator Steele  Hall, who is not a member of this Party and a long way from it, has said that this is electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and if anything favoured the Liberal Party in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently we are endeavouring to give electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> by seeing that members of this Parliament do represent people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost an axiom to say that people are equal under the law but this is true only if people have equal access to the law or are able to afford to take the matter to the court to gain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be done swiftly and <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be meted out swiftly if the present disorder is in any way to be contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister Does it trouble him as a matter of elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> that all the sworn testamentary and documentary evidence which was presented to the Royal Commission on Petroleum and which could have exonerated  Mr Souter  and the Australian Council of Trade Unions of the charge of deliberate deceit of the Government was entirely overlooked by the royal commission in its report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all the more astonishing that the honourable gentleman who a few months ago was loudly, even raucously, calling for a royal commission, should now complain about a royal commission’s findings which do not suit him.The fact is that the royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, is one of the most experienced trial judges in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister still believe that complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done to the Australian Council of Trade Unions in the finding of the royal commission that ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd deliberately deceived the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a case of <span class="highlight">justice</span> being done, but <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being entirely disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Answers given to me by the previous Minister that individual cases claiming injustice would be investigated were both ludicrous and foolish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way <span class="highlight">justice</span> will not only be done; it will appear to have been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member was not in this place at the time one of the major eastem European countries made an application to the then Attorney-General, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, to extradite to the Soviet Union mass murderer- and I name him again in this place- -Evon Vicks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Opposition that upholds the quality of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and evidence wants to destroy it here today on the sheer nonsense that  Mr Souter  would of course not have misled anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There have been many blatant examples of <span class="highlight">justice</span> having been denied to people over some of the most simple offences against the law simply because of the inability of the person charged or accused to understand the English language and to communicate with the law enforcement officers charging or accusing him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was made clear that increased costs would not be part of the scheme, but even there the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Senator James McClelland)  is looking at particular projects to ensure that substantial <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done in every case and that there is no undue hardship wherever that can be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Since he is so determined to support in full all the findings of the Royal Commissioner into petroleum,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, why has his Government so far ignored the finding of the Royal Commission that a second refinery should be built in the Sydney area at Kurnell and why has he allowed the Minister for Minerals and Energy to pursue an entirely alternative and different proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will know that on 26 September I announced that the Government had decided to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward, O.B.E., to be the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In announcing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s appointment, I said that it is appropriate that this very important position should be filled by a judge and that in the Government’s view this position should in future always be filled by a person holding judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I remind honourable members that while he was a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Owen  Dixon, who later became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, was appointed Australian Minister to the United States in 1942 and the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1 942 was passed to enable him to hold that office in addition to his judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward now receives such additional remuneration by virtue of his office as  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow the court to operate at its full strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s appointment with ASIO, which is for 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government dedicated to the preservation of a profit motivated society is considerably more, to their liking than one that seeks to give social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the fact that the other systems of change have so dismally failed that the High Court which interprets the Constitution and which I heard the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> say the other day was actually an arm of government that is something with which I might not necessarily agree- has turned out to be the instrument of change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Prahran, either that pan which comes into my electorate or that part which comes into Melbourne Ports, do not always attain legal <span class="highlight">justice</span> because of lack of means and/or lack of knowledge and fear of the legal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart from the  Chairman, Mr Roy  Turner whom I know, and who has a lot of practical experience as a private solicitor acting on the panel of the New South Wales Public Solicitor, other persons who were on the Committee were distinguished and experienced in the field of legal aid, including  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lalor who for many years was Public Solicitor in Papua New Guinea and for whom I worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that on numerous occasions I indicated to him that if this matter was not settled prior to independence it would go beyond this Parliament into the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister came in tonight and used the overwhelming majority of his statement to indicate all the background but he made no reference to the discussions that occurred prior to his assumption of office, no reference to the discussions that occurred shortly before he became Prime Minister, but rather sought to justify an exercise which was bent upon mischief, which sought to get around the Queensland view, and which probably will mean an inescapable venture into disputation for years to come- and not disputes in the Australian Territory but in the international sphere, not just through the United Nations but also at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus unless they are given assistance our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as a whole becomes suspect, and unbalanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real essence of the Bill and perhaps the real issue of the Bill, if one wants to put the issue rather brutally and bluntly, can be well summed up in perhaps one expression: <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to the rich; poor to the hulks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the poor, the disenfranchised, the indigent, the migrant, the disadvantaged who above all, because of their financial situation and distress, are denied access to any weight in the scales of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be held in prison without trial and without recourse to <span class="highlight">justice</span> is probably one of the greatest infringements of the basic human rights of freedom and liberty, particularly when the Indonesian officials admit that such prisoners were not involved with the coup in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any party or parties which say they stand for common <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a free electoral system ought to support the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen reports in recent weeks of welders being paid more than $30,000 a year and of the unions waging strike action against contractors on trumped up excuses which have had no relevance to wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the legitimate working conditions and requirements of the men engaged in this work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Oppositon is not willing to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the appearance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the Constitution, it deserves to have unleashed on it all the terror - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill will establish in our law those aspects of Aboriginal traditional law relating to land which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn could not uphold in 1971 in the Gove land rights case: It creates for Aboriginals proprietary interests in, and communal title to, land, and makes that title inalienable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill is to provide that the recently appointed Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, should continue to enjoy the rank and status that he enjoyed as a judge prior to his appointment as the Director of ASIO and in all respects to preserve his position having regard to his previous judicial status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth emphasising that following the undertaking contained in his policy speech on 29 April 1974 the Prime Minister established a commission of inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to conduct a judicial inquiry into the structure of the Australian security service and into methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecting citizens or migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Telephonic Communications (Interception) Bill is particularly pertinent both to the inquiry conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and to the amendments which have been introduced into this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not impossible, in fact it is quite likely, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has already given the Prime Minister a memorandum suggesting these amendments, but it is not unreasonable for us to suggest that the exercise of responsibility conducted by the previous Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, in his actions in raiding ASIO in 1973, and the profound effect which that action had on the Organisation, could well have led the Prime Minister to conclude that he could not trust any other Minister within his ministry to conduct and oversee the vital work which is the responsibility of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking off the cuff, but from memory the Australian security organisation was set up under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first and perhaps one of the important factors relating to them is that they maintain the status of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be nothing worse than the growth of a bureaucracy in this field; for people who seek legal aid, who seek to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> as they see it, to be dependent upon a bureaucratic service of legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One has only to be involved in a court case, being counsel for one or other of the litigants, to see that to exactly the same extent as the plaintiff claims that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is on his side so the defendant claims that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is on his side also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> is never cheap but the opportunity to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>, according to the litigants or the persons caused, must be made available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing that is fundamental in our democracy, in our system of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>, in our understanding of the common law rights of the citizen, it is that each citizen not only should have the opportunity to receive the services of the law but also should have the right to obtain the services of the lawyer of his choice, who is independent of everyone- government and individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have long become resigned to the fact that most members representing the Liberal Party and the National Country Party in this House have a complete disregard for truth, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and honour if they believe there is some political advantage that can be scored regardless of their actions or statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Senate, this responsible Senate, has forced the Australian Government to the final court of appeal- the ultimate bar of <span class="highlight">justice</span>- where this Government’s condemnation will be final and complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman knows because he has been informed right from the beginning that these changes are within the terms of reference of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, the royal commissioner looking into Australia’s security services, and are recommendations which he has made; but, moreover, the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act itself says how warrants can be issued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would, I believe, endorse and applaud the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward as the new Director of Security, and the Australian people ought to be reassured that there will be no telephone’ tapping warrants issued in Australia unless  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward makes that recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say about that, of course, is that having appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo to hold - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall not spell out, because one could write an essay on it, the abuses that could become apparent with an income test, but basically we see no <span class="highlight">justice</span> or equity in applying a means test, for example, to a relatively small farmer who is suffering very bad times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is fair to be saying that members of the Opposition are inaccurate in what they say or that they have erred on the side of exaggeration or whatever, but when any man in this place imputes dishonour, lack of truth or lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that person first, I suggest, has to make absolutely sure that his own slate in those 3 qualities is absolutely and perfectly clean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he make representations to both the New South Wales and South Australian Governments in an endeavour to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the individuals who are awaiting their compensation payments, in particular,  Mrs Ormsby,  a widow with six children, whose husband died in an accident in 1971, and who has been waiting since that date for the sum of $ 10,000 owing to her by this company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area in which much investigation in strict <span class="highlight">justice</span> could be carried out to seek to alleviate the problems of the rural producer who has no set income and who is subject to tremendous pressures from seasonal changes in the economy and changes in overseas prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that if that refusal continues it will have a serious and disruptive impact on the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these are basic elements in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the refusal continues and persists, if it is taken much longer to the extreme, there can be no doubt that it will have a serious and disruptive impact on the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean- and any person familiar with the working of the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would know- that prosecutions could not be launched, that government departments, government agencies, if sued, could not be represented in the courts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all, it would have a very serious consequence for the whole administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in the Australia Capital Territory it could mean for example, in the short run, the early discontinuance of the system of night courts which provide such a ready and amenable system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, bringing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people who need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill before the House amends that provision of the original Bill relating to the power of the Authority to acquire interests in mining undertakings, and deletes, inter alia, those provisions relating to the declaration of an area to be a petroleum exploration area or a mineral exploration area, the provision for losses suffered by the Authority in providing overseas aid to be reimbursed by the Australian Government, and the power to enter land under warrant of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and other provisions related thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not blame  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All of us were informed by local government people in our electorates how difficult it was for them to expect <span class="highlight">justice</span> at the hands of the State Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly not clear under the Opposition’s proposals how this <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be meted out, how that equity will be dealt out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government, which purports to believe in the fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the arbitration system, honour the resulting determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-55-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission since April 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until it does, or until we send from this Parliament a Bill which does, we will not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not bring harmony, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said in his report, between the Aboriginal community and the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn in the Gove case makes it clear that the relationship cannot be expressed in terms of our laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, acknowledging the danger of generalisation, expressed the relationship by saying that the clan belongs to the land rather the land belongs to the clan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, under the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, it is made up of persons speaking a common language and having a common patrilineal descent, but the people who speak the same language may in fact be made up of people of different patrilineal descent and people of the same patrilineal descent may in fact speak different languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was found in the Gove case by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, although the Crown in that case argued otherwise, the boundaries of lands could be denned with a certain degree of particularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tried to summarise it in what I believe is the form in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn considered it in the Gove case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are no requirements of a procedural nature even to ensure basic natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the implementation of inquiries by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it was, and maybe  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward did look into the matter and come to a different view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suggest to honourable members that there is a very serious problem involved here and one to which we will not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> if we simply allow this Bill to pass through this Parliament without very careful and further consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward reported that at least 2 kilometres of the sea should be part of the title to the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward used the term ‘spiritual feeling’, and I suppose all of us would be deficient in that kind of sensitivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time already taken in investigation of these proposals and particularly in investigation of the proposal of land rights for Aborigines has been  very great, and there can be no question that the inquiry into land rights carried out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was one of the most thorough and searching inquiries which has been seen in this country in recent years, yet the Opposition is anxious to see this legislation referred for yet another inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land commission as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is not just one person as this Bill suggests by the use of the term ‘Aboriginal Land Commissioner’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward had in mind a body which consisted of expertise in the area, that is to say, there would be a number of people who would sit on the commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the Commissioner who has been appointed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, will continue if this Bill passes into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That rather emphasises that there might be some point in what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless we are not thinking sufficiently about the ways of achieving the best result initially if we simply push this sort of measure into law in this country, and this is all the more so in this case where, for instance, we do not even have any explanation of the reasons why there is a material departure from the scheme laid down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to mention in respect of the comment made by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  that the Commission is entitled in terms of the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to support and to expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward or whoever the Commissioner may be from time to time, may carry out his functions in a way which does not upset the major economy of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision has been inserted since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward brought down his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward made a point of consulting with Aborigines throughout the whole course of his inquiry during 1973 and up to the submission of his report in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has acted against the Constitution, as it did last year, and is seeking to subvert the Constitution now, seeking to go against the opinion of that learned judge  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy and that learned Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authorised person may enter with the consent of the occupier or may apply to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace for a warrant authorising entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all held a view about that, a view which was held by the Court of Disputed Returns, constituted by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, to be erroneous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I became Minister for Education the previous Government had set up a committee of inquiry into academic salaries under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely without any requirement of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find in these 2 clauses no basic guarantee of land rights; no basic guarantee of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who may require some sort of a hearing; and no independent body set up in order to determine matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that there has been an intense involvement by my Department, by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and by myself with Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly that is an attempt to identify the owners in terms of all the traditions; not the white man’s imposed principles or concepts but in every respect having regard to the anthropological advice to which the Government and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward have had access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is embodied in clauses 24 and 25 of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has bent over backwards to identify the processes by which such problems can be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of them is a separate entity entitled to identifiable land, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn found in the Gove case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot find anything in the Woodward Commission’s report that really clarifies why  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward came to this conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would know from the terms of reference of the Commission and the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that a great deal of dependence was placed on the judge to find the answers to a wide range of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is making the point that he very much listened to and was greatly influenced by Aboriginal opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister apparently did not realise what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was saying in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept the contention that everything that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said really is in line with Aboriginal wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happened not in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward but in relation to an administrator of the Northern Territory who knew Aborigines and was very sympathetic towards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that they are consenting to land trusts in the sense that the Minister spoke about a moment ago when he quoted from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A final judgment by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General draws attention also to the fact that he had consulted the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1985, is there any evidence, other than his belief, that the case Australia put to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in 1973 served as a focal point in the mobilisation of international opinion against French atmospheric testing, and that this factor was one which influenced the French Government in the decision which it took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if we want to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parliamentary system we should vote for the honourable member for Scullin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lines certainly became blurred when the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was asked to give his opinion to the executive head- the Governor-General- as to whether certain things could or could not be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These Bills were introduced following the announcement of the decision to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar provision was contained in the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1942 which provided for the appointment of  Sir Owen  Dixon, then a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, to be Australian Minister to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward now receives such additional remuneration by virtue of his office as  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow the court to operate if necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s appointment with ASIO which will be for a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That separation was broken by the advice tendered by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to the Governor-General, even though the Governor-General had contrary advice from the Crown Law officer,  Mr Maurice  Byers, who is the Commonwealth SolicitorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That officer’s advice was contrary to the advice of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> which happened to fit in with the advice of the present AttorneyGeneral, the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  who is a relative of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member has made certain suggestions but in my opinion up to this point of time he has not stated in a direct and deliberate manner that there was any improper motive applying to either  His Excellency  or the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The community of Australia wants to know that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and it should always appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not approve of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> giving advice as to what he thinks is the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly known that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, as far back as the middle of October, was expressing views as to what he thinks should have happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a conspiracy with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to remove the elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nationwide unrest and disquiet about his involvement and that of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the affairs of 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or did he substitute this obligation improperly with the advice of the then Leader of the Opposition, the then shadow AttorneyGeneral and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> alone, not the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> with his colleagues who comprise the High Court; and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is a former Liberal Minister who is related to a present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt at all that the commitment given by the Government will be honoured and that the people of Tasmania will once more be placed on a basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, parity and equality with their colleagues on the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Road Safety and Standards Authority arose out of a report of the Expert Group on Road Safety formed under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares in November 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme fails utterly to come to grips with any questions of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or equality or need as between Australians, between regions, between cities and towns, between rural and urban populations, or even- in any worthwhile sense- between the States themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the actions of the Governor-General, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Prime Minister leading to the  coup d’etat  of 1 1 November are taken as a precedent, it means that a party must achieve a majority in both Houses to be able to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that move? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that we have a system of courts based upon principles of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>, independent of political control and influence, which will always act to ensure that the system operates properly and effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition also will be aware that under his Government  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney carried out an investigation and subsequently made a report suggesting certain measures which could be taken and which would at least in part help to overcome the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently legislation was introduced into this Parliament which so far as the Commonwealth was able to legislate went in line with what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I apprehend that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be making recommendations on this matter pursuant to his royal commission into the intelligence and security services of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government responded to public interest in Australian security activities by appointing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to conduct the royal commission which I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report and the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward, O.B.E., as Director-General will do much, I believe, to reassure the public that the excesses of similar agencies abroad will not be experienced in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will remember that before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was appointed as Royal Commissioner into the intelligence and security services of the Australian Government I had let you see the terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Speaker, I can assure you that later when there were changes in the head of some of the security organisations, such as the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward himself, your successor, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  was similarly informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to put the reasons why I feel that way, but first let me point out that there is no criticism of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in anything I say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not quite catch whether he said that he expected  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report to recommend that ASIO be placed under the responsibility of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was  president  of the Council for Civil Liberties for many years while I was its treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward should become the DirectorGeneral of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, as did the previous Government, has confidence in the capacity of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to bring to bear in this organisation those attributes which are obviously necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that a person who incurs a debt as a member of a partnership remains liable for that debt after he has left the partnership, and that directors of corporations which are creditors of failed partnerships have a duty to their shareholders to pursue all persons who were partners in the partnership at the time the debt was incurred to seek satisfaction of that debt, I ask whether the honourable member’s Bill will ensure that white collar crime of this type would be more difficult to perpetrate in the future and that persons who deceive the public in security transactions are brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would remind him of the occasion when Clarrie 0 ‘Shea was gaoled by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr for carrying out the wishes of his union members on an industrial matter and not because of his political complexion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr committed him to gaol and the whole industrial union movement, not just one pan with a certain political complexion, got behind him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I beleve that some of the Labor policies, such as the Australian Assistance Plan, were moving in the right direction, but the election results must show conclusively that the people of Australia are now aware that schemes to ensure social <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be coupled with sound economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party should, if there was any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the electorate system, have somewhere near 20 seats more than it currently has in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Country Party was frantic that an electoral redistribution which just might be passed by the Liberal members of the Senate- those few who might have had some sense of fairnessmight have brought some equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the distribution of electors in Australian electorates and reduced the disproportion of representation they have in relation to the votes which they are able to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner this is remedied the sooner we can see that those most worthy persons in our community are given the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which they are entitled under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has even failed to go on with the Australian Heritage Commission which was a positive recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the New South Wales Supreme Court following his inquiry into the national estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a decision that was brought about because of the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon’s continual invitation to people to challenge the exercise of arbitral and non-arbitral powers by the same body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a stupid decision, and I am pleased to note that the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has regarded it as stupid and that the High Court has virtually invited the Government to challenge it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in that aspect there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already in my brief term of office I have seen situations that reflect little <span class="highlight">justice</span> for those underprivileged sections of my electorate that cruelly perpetuate depressed environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be thought of the next Government if it were to interrogate the official drivers of last year’s Leader of the Opposition about the newspaper proprietors, the bankers, the company directors and the clubs he had visited, or if it were to instigate an interrogation of the official drivers of the Governor-General and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to discover what trysts and rendezvous they had, where they met each other or where they met others in November, October or September last? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the Commonwealth Police surveillance we all recall that the Attorney-General, who was then the Leader of the Government in the Senate and who is now a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, was seeking for that same lady discounted Commonwealth accommodation in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point of order is that the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party is making imputations against a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not keep us down because we of the Labor movement have fought for too long for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to run a system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country which is dependent upon the mental ability, or lack of it, or peculiarity of any Attorney-General? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot run <span class="highlight">justice</span> according to the peculiarities of the mentality of those men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot run law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least we have some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political problems of any party are subject to the judgment of the people but police action is subject to the judgment of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a court, a jury, a judge, based on the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot state that the results of the election on 13 December 1975, which should never have been held, determine the propriety of the actions of 1 1 November 1975 and at the same time come in here, one after the other, spouting the most fantastically bad law and political theory in supposed justification and amplification of the GovernorGeneral’s statement and of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell will take notice of those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that it was made with a very sensitive sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the Government has concerning these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members can look to it with some sense of hope and some sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1953, as a result of the conniving of the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, and the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kelly, the then Government was able to dispense completely for many years with the basic wage, which to some degree was related to wage indexation as we know it today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is about things like liberty, <span class="highlight">justice</span>, democracy, equality of opportunity and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that we do not have the appearance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to be very careful that we always make it clear that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done in respect of everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view is that we believe in social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, whatever that may mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we are not that far apart on issues of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> that measures which are the basis of the setting up of the Committee cannot be given priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the motion to suspend the Standing Orders will not be carried, but at least I put this to the Attorney and I think that professionally he would see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of it: Will he table the notarised documents to which he has referred so that honourable members can ascertain the name of the person who swore this false declaration and so that they can see the nature of the allegations that were made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That cannot be done either in the interests of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or, alternatively, in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the individuals against whom allegations may be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This in itself vindicates and recognises the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the proposal by the Opposition today to discuss this as a matter of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mt  HYDE (Moore) (9.57)-The Bills before the House propose minor amendments to the wheat stabilisation package; firstly to enforce compliance with the intention of that package and, secondly, to effect greater <span class="highlight">justice</span> to wheat growers by providing that that portion of the cost of production that represents the grower’s own earnings escalates with rising costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the merits of using the home market to limit the more violent movements in growers’ returns, it is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> that some growers receive greater benefits in times of low prices while only bearing a proportionate share of the costs in time of high prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, however, as we sec from the Governor-General’s address and as outlined in the third part of the amendment of the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins ), this Government intends to destroy that program- a program that was designed to ensure greater social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality of opportunity for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the care, compassion and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the conservatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was delighted to hear the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales give the lie to reports that he advised the Governor-General against his proposed actions in November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> requires that if there is to be a contraction of money supply and of the volume of money that contraction be spread, both in terms of the interest rate charges people pay and the volume of money available to people who would negotiate housing loans in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact too that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore has convened conferences and has been aware of salary increases to various employees in particular branches of the metal industry to give effect to the clear case and claim by the metal unions for a catch-up claim in wages? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he say whether the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> sent a letter or letters to his fellow Justices of the High Court concerning consultations he had on the dismissal of the Whitlam Ministry on 11 November 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask him whether he has asked the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> whether he sent such a letter or such letters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has not asked the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, will he do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government now has before it for consideration the report of the independent inquiry into the repatriation system by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the present situation I believe that again the arguments are in our favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There could hardly be a better example of the Government’s grotesque sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every unit attracts the same degree of benefit, and accordingly it is the converse of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man comes into this chamber and talks about moral bankruptcy, distorted priority and- I quote him- a grotesque sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man had the audacity to come into the House and tell us that the $30m, which is honouring an election promise, is a grotesque sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that it represents moral bankruptcy and distorted priorities and that it is a waste and an extravagance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were forced to change the position in the interests of equity, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and seeing that the Australian taxpayer’s dollar is spent in a proper manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money should have been used to provide ‘social <span class="highlight">justice</span>’- I think they were the words he used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it a little difficult to believe that my former parliamentary colleagues,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy and  Mr Kep  Enderby, were intimidated by their departments about anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the honourable gentleman aware of a recent book claimed to be of great literary merit entitled  Kerr’s King Hit,  particularly as the book relates to comments attributed to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> categorically denied the book’s assertions and would this be yet more evidence that the book which so piously claims to be factual is, in fact, a work of second-rate fiction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, I also understand that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales has in fact denied it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attempt to involve innocent people like the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales is a clear example - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it was not the State Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who was involved in the conspiracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implication is that it was another Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then other factors have been taken into account, including the environmental considerations presently under scrutiny by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too many years pensioners, particularly those whose income is almost entirely dependent on the pension, have not been given an adequate sense of security or social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before honourable gentlemen opposite continue to disparage this provision they ought to have a look at the report of the independent inquiry into the repatriation system that was recently presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose indicates that the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act provides for a sum of $300 for the funeral allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me there are two important points: One is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be seen to be done as well as be done, and the second point is that the Public Service is there to serve the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System, the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, as did the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  in his contribution to the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  remind me, I freely admit, as is stated in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, that the terms of reference of the inquiry specifically precluded the making of any recommendations in relation to levels and actual rates of pensions and allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the next and vital step in order to ensure that .there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity for those dependent upon the pension is to do what the honourable member for Perth so cogently pointed out this evening is necessary to assess the adequacy of the index to which pensions are related. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that we are looking for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity for pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am on the side of truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, not hooliganism and barbarity as you are always advocating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine that, if there is any truth in the story, people administering <span class="highlight">justice</span> in New South Wales might feel that those who are seeking to intrude into the privacy of others should, to some degree, be asked to state the reasons why they want the information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question was raised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Megarry of the English High Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in his fifth Riddell Lecture in 1972 and his comments perhaps are even more pertinent today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are only doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to our own servants, our direct employees, in the provisions of this Bill, but this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parliament has an obligation to try to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all sections of the community, to see that the national cake is distributed properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment and I am very disappointed that at an earlier time the previous Parliament could not see its way clear to give to the Australian Government’s public servants the <span class="highlight">justice</span> they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, he declared that it was his purpose to see, as a matter of social, moral or economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that a supporting fathers allowance was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member quoted  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and I would like to quote him again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose said in his report that the substantial body of evidence that he had received said that the tribunals acquitted their responsibilities well and expressed complete satisfaction with their work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we had the extraordinary spectacle of the then Attorney-General at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, not to mention the way in which the decision was leaked by the then Prime Minister prior to the Court handing down its decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think, however, that he does himself <span class="highlight">justice</span> when he says that he is a protectionist as against free traders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that one speech the most scurrilous allegations were made against a private citizen without notice; disgraceful allegations were made against the entire legal profession in New South Wales- and I will snow why; disgraceful allegations were made against a magistrate; a disgraceful allegation, which was really an aside, was made against 2 members of this House, one the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser);  there was a disgraceful innuendo or imputation against the Governor-General; and there was one of the worst possible breaches of privilege of this House one could imagine in an attack on the entire administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said that the New South Wales courts would not wish to muddy their track record of double standards in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable member for Hunter was saying what that there was a track record, a history and a tradition of double standards in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the New South Wales courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the courts to which the people throughout the State go for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the courts in which the people have confidence, the courts of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> in which the people have had confidence for thousands of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my understanding there has never been any sort of general or blanket attack upon the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in New South Wales such as was made by the honourable member for Hunter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these poorer groups, younger people in particular, to hold out a reward for savings which they cannot make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill which the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  has introduced is designed to bring clarity, honesty and a measure of elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the vexed question of the funding of election campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It takes away common sense and <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the legislation my Minister introduced last year and replaces them with an irresponsible, pork barrel approach to a vital national problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would that be of some benefit to the Parliament but it would also assist people such as the Parliamentary Counsel who for a period of years have been working in a situation in which they were getting less than the people working for them, and that is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> by any stretch of imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor referred at page 347 to the fact that what was thought was going to be applied, particularly in the Australian Capita! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result was that, although the intention was that the 1 909 Act should apply, in fact the 1910 Act applied with as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor said, a curious legislative muddle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Treasurer agree that this is an example of people- for example,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby- getting on the Cameron privacy waggon which has been rolling since I arrived as a member of this House in 1966? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby is on the honourable gentleman’s privacy waggon but I am well aware, by recollection over the years, of the very considerable interest in and the particular contribution which the honourable member for Griffith has made to making Australians better aware of the need to ensure that our people are protected against the types of invasion of privacy to which he has made earlier reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make no apology for the fact that he, together with 21 other people, happens to be a partner of my brother in a legal firm in Sydney, just as I would not have criticised the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dovey to the Family Law Court if that appointment had been made by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After  Sir Garfield  became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> an article he had written when Attorney-General was published in the first issue of the  Federal Law Review  in June 1 964 again arguing the case for a Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last July, in a speech to the eighteenth Australian Legal Convention in Canberra,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason, as he had become, summed up the problem faced by the High Court and the absurdity of shelving the Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason for proposing the Court in the first place was the need to relieve the High Court of most of its single <span class="highlight">justice</span> original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Ambassador in Washington has reported to date that contacts between his Embassy and the United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department had revealed no evidence so far about payments in Australia in respect of the sale of Lockheed aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add that the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department has said that its own investigations into the question of overseas payments in general were at a very early stage and would take many months to complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But like the question ‘What is <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only significant difference appears to be that where the person detailed for search so requires the search may only proceed on the authority of a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or a Collector (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the very real practical considerations- such as the difficulty of locating a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> where compelling circumstances for search may exist in remote areas of Australia, and the need to be able to cope immediately with an armed person- I do not intend to vary present legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, new instructions require that a person detained for search be given the option of whether he prefers that the matter of search be determined by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or a Principal Officer of Customs, and that as far as possible his wishes be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The woman concerned elected to have the matter of search determined by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or Principal Officer of Customs; but before suitable arrangements for this could be made, she disrobed in the Customs Hall at the Terminal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By any standards of conduct, towards Aborigines or non-Aborigines, this constitutes the most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that this was a most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was not just for the purpose of vindictively searching out people who had offended in the past and bringing them to the bar of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of the kind of situation which has characterised Aboriginal-police relations for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, since there has been large scale evidence of bad treatment of Aboriginal people by the courts, the police, institutional people and many others associated with <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I sought at the request of the Aboriginal Legal Service and a large number of other legal people and persons involved with social welfare organisations to extend the terms of that inquiry past the Northern Territory on to a Australia wide basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to him that the comprehensive nation-wide royal commission which the Labor Government had in mind and which was coming near to finality on 1 1 November last should be given effect to by this Government and that all governments in Australia should be asked to co-operate in the probe which all of us would hope will bring a fair go and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Aboriginal people who have been subjected to indignity for far too long in respect of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> must prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since  1972,  the Council  Chairman  has been  Mr. R.  M. Northrop, Q.C, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop has now reported to me and I have consulted with the principal parties to the industry on the details of their submissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having examined all material available concerning the future arrangements for the stevedoring industry, including the position statement prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, and having discussed this statement with major interests in the industry, the Government is now able to indicate the course of action it considers appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government notes that in paragraph 54 of his statement  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop identifies the problems arising under the existing arrangements as being: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is pointed out in the detailed position statement prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, no submission made to him favoured the retention of the existing arrangements but with the temporary legislation amended on a permanent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is proposed that to allow this industry to be placed on a basis which is as normal as possible the following steps are to be taken: The existing temporary legislation is to be continued until 31 December 1976; the ASIA is to continue its existing operations until 31 December 1976; arrangements will be put in hand to assist the staff of the ASIA as outlined earlier; the Stevedoring Industry Council, under the Chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, is to continue until 3 1 December 1976; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be asked to indicate the steps being taken to reduce the existing size of the workforce; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be required to submit for my consideration details of the arrangement proposed to deal with recruitment, redundancy and means of coping with the fluctuating labour requirements of the industry; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be asked to evidence means of securing adequate labour allocation arrangements; satisfactory arrangements have to be determined concerning funding arrangements for the industry; proposed consultative machinery should provide details concerning effective representation of user interests, for example, the Australian Shippers Council and other relevant bodies such as the Australian Ports and Marine Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications might have an early look at this matter to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and so that the Australian public will not unfairly be deprived of an effective news presentation which is at present occurring as a result of this dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has acquired a reputation in this chamber and throughout the country for his sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those cost pressures have to be reduced with an abiding sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and an abiding sense of the desire to distribute the burden in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Labour Government, for example, which is in a similar bind but rather worse, in trying to reduce cost pressures in that nation is not going to the same length to provide social <span class="highlight">justice</span> by guaranteeing disposable incomes to its own citizens with varying numbers of dependants and at various levels of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that significant turning point can only be gained and can only be secured if 4 areas of the population with responsibility realise the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the sense of fairness of what is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that underlay last night’s proposition ought to be appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Howard)  that in the very first customs case that came before the High Court- Murray and Company v Collector of Customs (1903), 1 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 25- Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Griffiths set out at page 36 the criteria for a customs measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even then I received <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the people not from the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my strong conviction that people must be involved in the issues that control their lives; they cannot leave it only to the ballot box every three years, they must be on guard and meet the issues day by day- it may only need to be a letter to the newspaper or a protest to your local politician but where it warrants it, it may need mass action, a mass protestwhether that action be the Victorian farmers marching on Melbourne, or people demonstrating against the war in Vietnam, or trade unionists demonstrating for economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>, or ratepayers demonstrating against their Council’s rezoning of their living area from a low ratio residential development to high rise, or it might just be a protest march to protect a pan of our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the previous Government’s interest and anxiety about the matter, it appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop to look at the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the matter of security, not one of those headings to which I have referred would be the province of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 March 1976 I informed the House that I did not think it would be in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to table the police report received by me concerning possible breaches of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If finance is delayed, <span class="highlight">justice</span> is denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the honourable member for Adelaide, let us look at what the Whitlam Government offered at the time of the South Australian election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government can only do what is possible in determining the adequacy and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of that market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is done, and if it is costed, I believe that it would provide a semblance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in respect of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government would get credit if the Minister would only indicate that this whole matter will be looked at again, with the idea of providing some semblance of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> that ought to apply in respect of this section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These formal bids will now be subjected- initially by the Treasury and eventually by the Budget Cabinet- to a thorough-going review against the broad criterion of containing Government spending while at the same time having regard to generally accepted notions of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Taxation Review Committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey also saw advantage in a change of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, as has been emphasised today, the arrangements made by the Government provide a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> whilst at the same time introducing a much needed area of financial responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has given a splendid opportunity through these proposals for these major sections of the community to work together with the Government for the common good of all Australians by providing an economic program which is vitally concerned with social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in conjunction with sound economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an element of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in both arguments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the announcement of its final decisions it ensured that special considerations will be given to the future of the problems of low income families and the needy to provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the individual taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission was established, as honourable members will remember, in September 1974 to investigate certain payments to maritime unions and the investigation was conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney will involve my colleagues the Attorney-General and the Minister for Transport, as well as my own Department in regard particularly to accounting practices of unions and financial reports to union members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental provision recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward- namely, to declare the nature of the Aboriginal land rights to their own land- was omitted from the Bill introduced by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the levels of $300 for those who want to stay in Medibank and $350 for those who decide to go into private insurance, as I mentioned, and an additional cost of $135 for private medical and intermediate hospital insurance for those who stick with Medibank, were not struck as a result of some searching guided by a sense of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other is to bring about greater wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and social benefits by the introduction of tax indexation and family allowances in the desire that there will be greater wage restraint on the part of the ordinary men and women of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowances plan obviously, therefore, has a dual benefit for the country: Firstly, it introduces a very real measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> into our welfare system and, secondly, together with the impact of” personal income tax indexation, it will redirect resources to people in the community who have a much higher propensity to consume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been a basic principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that <span class="highlight">justice</span> seen is <span class="highlight">justice</span> done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very significant matter that was referred to me by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Tasmania was whether contempt proceedings before the Family Court should be dealt with in open court or in closed court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a basic principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that that should not happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a member of the public or a member of the Press can go in, not to publicise what is being said by the parties but to see how the proceedings are being conducted, we are more likely to get purer <span class="highlight">justice</span> administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about is not <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but conquest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot reform our ancestors or reverse the past, but we can infuse <span class="highlight">justice</span> into the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taxation indexation must be seen as a device to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to taxpayers in an inflationary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happened that when I called for the legal advising as a matter of information for myself, that legal advising had been prepared not by a law officer of the Crown within the Public Service but by a former Attorney-General who is now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had no intention of compromising or embarrassing in any way at all the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia who might very well have been placed in the position of having to deliberate on this important case if it had proceeded further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Commonwealth necessarily wedded to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s proposal to validate or forget the past and merely alter the auditing obligation of bodies registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The report of the Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions, which was chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, was tabled recently in both the Senate and this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the report and the recommendations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney were under active consideration by the Government- by my Department, by the Department of the AttorneyGeneral and by the Department administered by my colleague the Minister for Transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear a lot about equality, <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all and the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believed that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia should be above Party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A month later the then Attorney-General now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, and I re-affirmed to the representatives of local government throughout Australia that we were still of the same determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me go back some years to what the former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, the late  Sir Owen  Dixon, said in the railway case of 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to alter, with <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the situation they developed and imposed upon the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, that cacophony of cliches which was delivered by the Leader of the Opposition did him no <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the honourable member to suggest that at some future point of time we will have a Labor Minister who may choose to appear on his own behalf and put submissions to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission does him less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> because he has appeared before that Commission on many occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the other more startling actions of this Government in relation to the environment, and a matter which is indirectly related to the subject of the debate today, was its high-handed action in directing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to complete the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry by May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox quite rightly ignored the direction and is ensuring that the inquiry is conducted in a proper manner- a manner that is laid down by the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the Industries Assistance Commission’s report on the dairying industry, I do not personally look on this referral of the problem to Crawford as being an appeal from Caesar to Caesar, but rather as a matter of poetic <span class="highlight">justice</span> due to the fact that some aspects of the IAC report are insufficiently thought through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason is that I believe it is morally wrong, in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and in law, to take a levy from a certain section of producers and not allow them to have representation in regard to the affairs of the Dairy Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the decision of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> he said that there was constitutional power under Chapter III, there was constitutional power under section 5 1 placitum (xxi) and under section 5 1 placitum (xxii). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has to look at what <span class="highlight">justice</span> means to the parties that are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every effort should be made to ensure parity of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these claims throughout Australia, striving to achieve uniformity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would only say that if judges are subject to scrutiny by members of the public it is more likely that there will be quality in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This intention was given support by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in the first report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that possibly the last Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the previous LiberalCountry Party Government understood this particular problem and made moves to try to stop this unfair administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amendment will provide a freedom and a <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the recess, however, it has been the practice for the  Speaker,  in order to prevent delays in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to allow the production of minutes of evidence and other documents, on the application of the parties to a private suit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously there are some cases, and the Scientology case is one of them in which what is said or done in Parliament is relevant to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To produce the  Hansard  in such a case would not be an infringement of privilege because Parliament has always recognised that it will not impede the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Parliament to claim privilege in relation to such a matter of evidence would be, quite clearly, to impede the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as it would mean that a party who had an adequate defence under the law would not be able to establish it unless he first established what was said in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would respectfully submit to you,  Mr Speaker,  that this is not a matter in which the  sub judice  rule applies, but the motion simply allows <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done if the event occurs between now and, say, 17 August, 24 August or whenever the Parliament resumes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It allows <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done to the extent it could be done by the issue of a subpoena should the Court of Appeal or some ultimate court of appeal hand down its judgment in the meantime in a way which would enable the proceedings at Queanbeyan to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In February 1 973, the former Government appointed an Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward, to inquire into and report on ‘the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land’ in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward presented his first report in July of that year and in it recommended that a northern and a central land council be established to consider the preliminary views he set down in that report, and to present to him, with expert legal advice, the views of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory on their land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward presented his second and final report in April 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the early tasks for the commissioner will be the consideration of the strength of traditional claims to the pastoral leases held by Aboriginal groups- not only the properties of Kildurk and Willowra, which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward considered in his report, but the property held by the Gurindji group at Wave Hill, and the several other properties recently bought for Aboriginal communities by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission or now being purchased by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that end I would expect the Land Commissioner, in considering the claims, to take account of the history of the properties and of the views expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where Aborigines have agreed to mineral exploration we would expect, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward proposed, that development of any economic discovery made would follow, subject only to agreement on terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where negotiations or terms break down, the Bill provides for an arbitrator to be appointed to determine a fair agreement, as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Heritage Commission, the establishment of which was proposed and enacted by the Labor Government, was to be the tool to achieve the fine aim of giving substance to the concept of the National Estate- a fine concept which was identified by the Australian Labor Party and which was enshrined by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and his colleagues in their fine report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third part of the review structure is carried out in the courts of law by means of the prerogative writs, the ancient writs of prohibition,  certiorari, mandamus  and  quo warranto  which draw on the inherent reserve power of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which resides in the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no exaggeration to say that in most cases before the courts, when an application is made for one of the prerogative writs a great deal of the case is occupied by argument as to whether these ancient remedies can be granted at all in the case that is before the court, while the substantive merits or the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the substance of the case is deferred as almost an appendage for later argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher investigated the living conditions of the working class people, the miners, at Blackwater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote what the Miners’ Federation and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher went on to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gallagher went on to refer to 2 miners wives who had given evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This time they had the active support of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, a man who had been an Attorney-General in a Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To act in the manner he chose,  Sir Garfield  Barwick had to ditch the convention that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court must not give secret advice to the Governor-General on a matter calling for an interpretation of the Constitution which could involve political partisanship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice which  Sir John  Kerr sought from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> should never have been tendered because it was political in content and purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went completely against the judicial convention that the Australian High Court has no advisory role, and certainly no single <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Court should tender advice on a matter which may come before the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, I think we have to concede, with an exceptional insight into the thoughts of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, he said that if the then Prime Minister did not seek an election ‘it could establish the circumstances where the Governor-General under section 61 of the Constitution would feel impelled to withdraw the Prime Minister’s commission’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my case it enabled the GovernorGeneral to dispense with the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to dismiss me without a reason and without giving me an opportunity to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not an extraordinary coincidence that, while  Sir Garfield  Barwick was walking around the High Court wishing that he had the power to sack the then Prime Minister in September last, the present Prime Minister had already worked out the precise legal formula which the Governor-General and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> were to endorse exactly 8 weeks later? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In substance, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> had told the Governor-General that he had the power to trample on yet another convention and, having that power, he should use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in any event the question of whether or not the Governor-General should disregard the Prime Minister’s advice was determined not solely by propriety but by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> asking whether the Governor-General had the power, firstly, to reject the advice of his chief Minister; secondly, to remove him from office; thirdly, to commission the minority leader in the Parliament to form a new government; fourthly, to dissolve the House of Representatives because of the Senate ‘s failure to grant Supply; and fifthly, then to dissolve the Senate itself for twice rejecting 2 1 Bills passed by the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Press deliberately ignores the fact that the system already has suffered almost irreparable damage at the hands of those who constitute the ruling class and those who serve the ruling class- the Governor-General, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Liberal Party, the National Country Party and the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some <span class="highlight">justice</span>, we must agree, in permitting those members of the community who have severely fluctuating incomes to average those incomes for taxation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government concerned that continued trade, diplomatic recognition and sporting and cultural ties, may serve to bolster the white Government and to jeopardise racial <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps I should remind the Minister that, in his judgment, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick said that sovereign rights to explore and exploit this area belong to the Australian Government in the right of the Crown and not the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last February in answer to my question on the seventh anniversary of the Industrial Court judgment in Moore v. Doyle which stressed the urgency of Federal and State legislation to reduce demarcation issues between Federal and State unions- in that case the transport workers unions- he stated that the Federal legislation passed after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s report depended on complementary or similar State legislation, and he went on to say that the matter was raised at almost every conference of Ministers for labour and that he himself would be looking at ways to deal with it with State Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is not the overlord in this fight; it relies on cooperation not coercion, sacrifice not spending, and responsibility not rashness in its relationships with the States to build a sound base of both <span class="highlight">justice</span> and interdependence in economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By sending some of the more productive cattle to these countries, Australia could well become the leader of an international effort to restore social equality, stability and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a hungry world and help to bridge the enormous gap which divides the nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The lack of apparent intervention and concern by previous governments is illustrated quite clearly in a letter received by the Commissioner of the Royal Commission on Petroleum,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, on 13 May 1975 from the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr Connor). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that the successful resolution of this case within the confines of the union movement supports the advice that I have been giving to other union members in a similar situation to those involved in this case, that is, to exercise fully their right to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> within the rules of the organisation to which they belong without in any way inhibiting their ultimate right to seek remedy in the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will say this and say it decisively- and again I think I speak for most of the people on this side of the House- if there is a cause for social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if there is a cause that merits a strike I would be the first one to commend to the men that they go on strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Which honourable member opposite is prepared to stand up and say that the Government’s proposal to put up $225m for aged persons homes and hospitals over the next 3 years is a great social <span class="highlight">justice</span> move? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Government is accepting the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, which is also a recommendation of the Returned Services League and of the Australian Services Council, that despite the very long-standing tradition the name of the Department of Repatriation ought to be changed to the Department of Veterans Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to remind honourable members that the Bally organisation was the subject of an inquiry in New South Wales into allegations of organised crime in clubs in which a royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moffitt, was specifically asked in term 3 of the reference to inquire whether: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Moffitt’s report was published in August 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite obviously the Liberal-National Country Party Government, aware of its responsibilities to ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span> and charity in the distribution of our economic resources, has seen fit to commit 25 per cent of its total Budget outlays, that is $6 187m, to this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago the Australian Labor Party set up a committee and apparently that committee has said that there was nothing improper in a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court advising the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All honourable members know that in 1914 there was a double dissolution and that in connection with it the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the day,  Sir Samuel  Griffith, advised the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is another precedent from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt, a High Court Judge- a Labor Judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In division 170.2.1, relating to the High Court travel expenses, including car hire for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, there is a reduction of $50,000.I assume that this is because cars are not going to be waiting around Admiralty House quite so much this financial year as they were last financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the days when legal aid was given free by the profession and in the days before the salaried scheme started, although it was not a perfect scheme, there were times when lawyers took up the cudgels and fought cases year after year until clients got <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a lot of cant it is, what a lot of humbug it is that a chief <span class="highlight">justice</span>, like the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or  Sir Samuel  Griffith, should be attacked for giving advice on a matter like this while he was a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do not believe that any modern community can afford to do away with some form of taxation upon estates, particularly large estates, because of the existence of large estates does pose very many difficult problems in a society that claims to give support to equity and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is on that basis that I say that our courts always stand for the best thing that I think the British have ever given us, that is, their system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> where all people are equal and no man is denied a fair trial and no man is denied his freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While there have been decisions either way, one is prone to think about the decisions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt in  Jolley  v  Mainka  and later in  Ffrost  v  Stevenson,  where he emphasised the fact that in his opinion the power was in the external affairs power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is noteworthy also that clause 7 of the Bill, in referring to the constitution of the court, provides that the High Court, when hearing an appeal or application for leave referred to in clause 5, is to be constituted as a full court of not less than 2 justices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Supreme Court of Nauru consists of a single Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and therefore it is appropriate to ensure that appeals or applications to appeals from his decisions are determined by at least 2 justices of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arises, of course, out of the feeling of the citizens of Nauru that <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be seen to be done if cases were dealt with by 2 persons independent of the rather limited environment and atmosphere of the island of Nauru which has been delineated by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Court consists at the moment of a single chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> and obviously it is important to the Nauruans to ensure that there are rights of access to the appellate court sitting as a full court in matters that are not of special or peculiar interest to Nauruans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is wrong that somebody can put on an interdict against an order of a court, because everything that has happened is against a direct order of a court, a direct order made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cahill, who can scarcely be accused of being in any way biased in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Chairman  of the Grants Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, in a recent address stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Had (the Whitlam Government not been dismissed) it is probable that the stage might have been reached where, as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Latham had said in the first uniform tax case, the States would have lost, if not their political independence, a large measure of their capacity to initiate their own policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time with the expanded role of the Grants Commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell we started to get a proper view of the role, functions and services that local government provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much does the Queensland Government think of this Government’s proposal that the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> went away post-haste- even leaving his private secretary on Hayman Island- to London with the parliamentary counsel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that this proposition is so good that the Government of Queensland has sent its Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to London to find a way around it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister In view of the contradiction between his views and the final recommendation of the Fox report which calls for further debate on the uranium issue before any decision is made, is there any significance in his meeting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in his office this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it amusing that the nation’s Prime Minister receives a salary that is $3,000 a year less than that of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia; that the nation’s  Deputy  Prime Minister receives less money than the judge who is second in charge of the Family Court; and that the nation’s Treasurer, the man who is supposed to come forward with all the answers to save the nation, receives a salary barely more than that of an ordinary Family Court judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the other day  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan in his late eighties at last threw down the flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mention was made- I thought it was a little unfortunate- of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan who has just retired from the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can speak from experience of the hard work that he did as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court over a period of 40 years, for 20 years of which I appeared constantly before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the principle that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied would be breached if we ever created a situation in which litigants in any remote part of Australia found it difficult to get their cases heard and determined with some degree of speed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 21 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting sub-section (1) and substituting the following subsection: ‘( 1 ) Applications for leave or special leave to appeal to the High Court from a judgment of another court may be heard and determined by a single <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or by a Full Court and the Rules of Court may provide for enabling such applications to be dealt with, subject to conditions prescribed by the Rules, without an oral hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that at present the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales is approximately $52,000 and the salary of a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales is approximately $47,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Bill before the Committee, the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court will be $52,500 and of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court other than the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> will be $47,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that they get <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that they should not have to pay for this momentous decision alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a former Attorney-General in the previous Government,  Senator Lionel  Murphy, who is now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will continue until we return to honesty and decency in government; until the rules of our democratic system are restored and upheld; until the Australian people reelect a government that stands once again for progress, humanity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> admitted that as far back as October last year, a month before the Governor-General acted, he had formed an opinion that the Whitlam Government should go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man with the status of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> certainly can mould the opinions of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is admitted in the letter of dismissal by the Governor-General to  Mr Whitlam  which shows that the opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> had been intruded into the Governor-General’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was not accepted by the Governor-General on that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The selfcentred advice volunteered by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was that the Governor-General should take the advice of  Mr Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- The Government has received the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which comprised  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, Professor C. B. Kerr and  Mr G.  G. Kelleher as the Commission of Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  stated in his second reading speech that it is a matter of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the Commonwealth Government has obligations to those who have given long and valuable service in the working of the phosphate deposits of the Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It agrees with the Government that <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands no other response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said that the Opposition welcomes this Bill as providing simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the Asian community on Christmas Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My support for this Bill and the principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which it enbodies is based on the understanding that this is what those concerned want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To simply negotiate the agreement, sign it and then to discharge further responsibility would be a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> but, in view of the son of things that happen under the Government’s standard of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span>, one would probably expect the Government to do just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been to Christmas Island and having seen people, I am very pleased that they are to get the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which they are entitled and will be relieved of the worries which have occupied them over recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister for Administrative Services was there, he demonstrated that they would obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It brought <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the industry and in fact maintained the most efficient dairy producers in the most efficient areas in a reasonable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in introducing the Bill, it is the Government’s intention, as it was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s recommendation, that existing rights in land should be fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Petroleum interests, also frozen since December 1972 like those held by Magellan in Central Australia as considered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, will be dealt with in the same way by clarifying amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments are proposed to ensure that the procedures for consent to mining conform more exactly to the principles proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This change is proposed in response to the many representations by Aboriginal groups and others seeking restoration of the provision proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward for parliamentary review of any Government decision to override Aboriginal wishes in relation to mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision relating to agreements for  mining  will be amended m order to reflect more clearly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s intention that any negotiated payments should go not to individuals, but to communities or groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a claim is made to Tanami, I would fully expect the observations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward on Tanami to be taken into account in the formulation and determination of the claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the Parliament will give the Bill the attention it deserves and will find that the amendments I have here outlined briefly will strengthen the essential provisions of the Bill while guaranteeing proper protection of existing statutory and other rights as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In substance, however, this Bill radically alters the aims of the 1975 Bill and substantially modifies the recommendations and intentions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward whose reports formed the basis of the Labor Government’s Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, speaking on the question of land and in relation to the Aboriginal people, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Blackburn went on to discuss the doctrine of ‘communal native title’, the central question in the Gove land case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this central point  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn held that the Aboriginal parliament, through the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain, could exercise power over the whole of the Commonwealth and in particular that land claimed before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim report of the commission established to investigate how land rights could be granted statutorily,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, who was a counsel in the Gove land rights case, pointed out that the Aboriginal concepts related to land owning have no parallel in European law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  an extract from the first report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward on Aboriginal land rights, entitled  Aborigines and Their Land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations of the second and final report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission which was presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward formed the basis of the Land Rights Bill that was introduced into the Parliament 13 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill, which was the result of IS months of investigation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and 18 months of consultation with Aboriginal groups, lapsed on the dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This final provision followed directly on the recommendation made in paragraph 740 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, where he stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition proposes to move in the Committee stage a number of amendments to reinstate the Australian Government’s jurisdiction over these matters, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended and as the Australian people decided in the 1967 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1975 Bill gave legal recognition to the already existing Northern and Central Land Councils established on the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, in paragraph 359 of his second report, recommended that land councils have power to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On perhaps the most important function of all- that of co-ordinating land claims- the Government has reverted to the provisions of the Labor Bill which followed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, despite reverting to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s original intention with regard to the land councils’ co-ordinating role in land claims, this Bill has severely limited the range of claims which are to be heard by the Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward proposed that an Aboriginal Land Commissioner be appointed to determine claims from Aboriginal people which were based not on traditional grounds but rather on need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These claims, which have been heard by the Interim Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, whose reports have been widely accepted, are now to be heard by the Northern Territory Lands Board and not by the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has stated that despite a recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in paragraph 150 of his report that the Tanami Desert people be included in any transfer of land to Aboriginal ownership because of the close traditional ties to the Walpiri people- the largest tribe in the Northern Territoryand despite the inclusion of the Tanami Desert in schedules of both the 1975 and 1976 Bills, it is now to be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A spirit of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> animates the Government’s purpose in introducing this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is getting on for 4 years since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was appointed to look into the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members have only to look at the comparative paper- the one that I have in my hand at this time- to appreciate that whilst  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward made certain recommendations, when we come to put them into a legal document they cannot always be followed in their entirety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes clear and emphasises something which I see as important and which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward saw as important, and that is a recognition of a fundamental principle to Aboriginestheir sense of Aboriginality was their affinity with land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wanted to take honourable members through some of the comments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in relation to land because I believe there has been some harm done by those who suggested that he did not place a great deal of significance on the Aboriginal concept of land ownership and the traditional forms of land ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the case in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn was involved, the Yirrkala case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This goes against what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That quite clearly is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended and, of course, this Bill departs from that recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weaknesses of the existing ordinances were specifically referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, and the Labor Government’s 1975 Bill attempted to remove these weaknesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct the attention of all honourable members who are concerned about these particular aspects of the legislation to what was said by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in paragraphs 83, 84, 95, 96, and 361 of his 1974 report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was thoroughly conscious of the need to provide within Australia domestic law for the traditional interests of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership rights of Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a matter which perplexed  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was proposed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that Aborigines should also have the rights to minerals within their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government reveals its true colours and it stands condemned by all enlightened people who seek peace and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general point to be made at the outset in dealing with the corporation power must now be seen in the light of the concrete pipes instruction by the court to read its terms ‘broadly and not narrowly’- as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies said at page 5 1 1 of the Commonwealth Law Reports of 1971- and not ‘in any narrow or pedantic manner’- as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, said at page 490. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen in the case  Mikasa  v.  Festival Stores  stated that the past participle often applies equally to the future as to the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it any wonder that investment is so scarce these days when there is not the continuity or integrity that is necessary to guarantee to the people who do invest that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Measures to overcome the problems of the industry as had been identified in the report presented to me by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a recent speech delivered in Canberra the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had there not been a change of government 12 months ago it is probable that the stage might have been reached where, as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Latham had said in the first uniform taxation case, the States would have lost if not their political independence a large measure of their capacity to initiate their own policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why at the present time the Opposition has never brought any case against the Governor-General or the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It tried to have the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court impeached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute in this House to the painstaking work of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his fellow commissioners and congratulate them on the studious, temperate and, in its essence, profoundly humane report which they have given the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox and his two fellow commissioners are known to be concerned that their report on the Ranger inquiry is being widely interpreted as the go-ahead for the mining and export of uranium, subject to strict control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox and the two commissioners from the Ranger environmental inquiry have attacked the Government over its interpretaton of the Fox Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox says that it is one of the most important things discussed by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to emphasise this point because there are many people who might agree with the clear dangers and reservations expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and by the Flowers Royal Commission but who say resignedly: ‘What is the use? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in today’s Press it is reported that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has written to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  complaining of the Government’s misinterpretation of the Commission’s recommendations and findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all due respect to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, we never required that inquiry to be aware of the safeguards that must be applied in the mining and export of uranium ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say whether the increases will make workers, who are forced to accept plateau indexation, sceptical of the relative <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the tribunals for labour and big business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer him to the arrangement between the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Australian Attorney-General’s Department dated 13 September 1976 regarding the Lockheed aircraft matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward made recommendations on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is not on his own in expressing enthusiasm for this concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a situation embellished by the support of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and the former spokesman on Aboriginal affairs for the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, with the greatest of respect to the honourable member, that it does not do his intellect any <span class="highlight">justice</span> to hear the arguments which he has put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct the attention of the honourable gentleman to the definition of Aboriginal provided in the draft Bill annexed to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to amendments 2, 3 and 4, the Opposition is very concerned that the intentions of  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, to include Aborigines who live in towns as being capable of having land granted to them have been circumvented by the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the purpose of these amendments is to give effect to the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that the Aboriginal Land Commissioners have jurisdiction to make recommendations relating to grants of land for Aboriginals within towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his recommendations  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward stated in paragraph 328 that planning for Aboriginals in towns must involve consulting them and determining their preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without these amendments a large number of Aboriginal families and communities will be excluded from the operation of this legislation and will be forced to go once again cap in hand to the Department of the Northern Territory which has led the opposition to the granting of land in towns and to the claims heard already by the interim Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward stated that most of the fringe dwellers of cities and towns have suffered more from the coming of white settlement than have those still living on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward referred to the census conducted in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said, in effect, of these people- I will not quote all the provisions because I do not have time- that their problems were urgent and important and that they related to social welfare and urban development issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government can bastardise this legislation and it can ruin it but this was indeed the unqualified intent of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward which has been set out in the most unequivocal and unambiguous terms in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Government can put up a case against the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to this Parliament it ought to adopt the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward certainly made out a most forthright case along the lines that the amendment proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one point in time we were all in agreement in respect of this matter-  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the Opposition and the Liberal and National Country parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we have been discussing this matter  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has been quoted at length as being the ultimate authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said by the advisers of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that the area in Central Australia was an isolated case of church dominance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to have been completely ignored by the advisers to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the amendment moved by the Opposition to include a reference to land in towns, the Opposition has drawn on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, when speaking of town claims, clearly indicated that the tenure of any land in towns by Aborigines should be the same kind of tenure as that for all other persons and that any requests for such land should go through the normal town planning procedures of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is not proper and it is not consistent with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to be renewing mining leases; that mining leases should get automatic renewal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said in his report, which was brought down in April 1974, that 29 exploration licences had been granted to 17 applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, as  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward pointed out, actually made the recommendation that there should be a freeze over mining renewals and mining development for 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is contrary to what he put before; it is contrary to what the Bill introduced by the Labor Party provided; it is contrary to what was said by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward; it is contrary to the recommendations of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs; and it is contrary to what has been said by anybody with a reputation in respect of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without labouring the point, it is contrary to the recommendations made under the tourism heading and under several other headings by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the suggestion by the honourable member, admirable as it is, was not accepted either by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report or by the previous Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will we do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this Bill or will the debate be curtailed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we can do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the legislation in the time that the Minister has proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However in paragraph 84 of the Commission’s second report  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward stated that the system which he considered to be most in harmony with traditional Aboriginal social organisations was that of a trust made up of clan elders supported by an administrative organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, at paragraph 89 of his report recommended the use of a trust, that is a land trust, in all cases for convenience of legislation and ease of understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect I refer the Committee to what was said by  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, at paragraph 161 of his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that there are good reasons why we should have regard for the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that this matter be the subject of Federal legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another matter for which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended the Australian Government should have responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is another matter about which there were specific recommendations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Very precise recommendations were made by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in respect to permitting reasonable access to pastoral properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development a question concerning correspondence between him or other Ministers and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has in fact received a number of letters from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask the Minister now whether he wil table the correspondence between  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and himself or at least the letter which his representative describes as being concerned with the interpretation that is placed upon the Commission’s first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition is obviously trying to make an issue of the question of private correspondence that I have had with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that I have had private correspondence with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter has been satisfactorily resolved between  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The documents to which I referred yesterday represented all the material that had come before what I understand is the Church committee and had been sent on to the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Measures to overcome the problems of the industry as had been identified in the report presented to me by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They not only want the Arbitration Commission to ignore the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the claims for keeping up with the consumer price index but also want to take away from the Prices Justification Tribunal its overseer role in looking at price rises in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In adopting this standard, the Government has failed to acknowledge the need for and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of a higher rate of accrual for people as they become more senior in their service and of the greater need for them to take longer periods of long service leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not done, then the appeals procedures which apply in normal Commonwealth Public Service cases are open to people who have been transferred to Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong probably will recall that at that time I indicated that the Government had referred the whole question of privacy to the Law Reform Commission under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important things that we have asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby to do, under that Commission’s terms of reference, is to inquire into the question of privacy, particularly as it relates to private health insurance and health matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dispute has been before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Coldham on a number of occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its emergence comes at a time when thousands of pharmacists were beginning to give up hope that they would ever see <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the determination of their remuneration for dispensing prescriptions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have not quite made the grade in their bid for <span class="highlight">justice</span> on fee determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this issue I was convinced that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was not being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor should the Opposition spokesman for Health make any apology for the failure of the former Labor Government to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done to the Pharmacy Guild. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must at least appear to be done in respect of the determination of services rendered on behalf of the public or on behalf of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these poorer groups, and to the younger people in particular, to hold out a reward for savings which they cannot make; savings which are now beyond their ability because of this Government’s economic mismanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney in his interim report of last year proved that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few extracts from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s report, I think, will prove it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I indicated in Parliament on 1 December 1976 nothing in documents’ received by my Department from the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in connexion with the Lockheed Corporation matter suggests any breach of law or other impropriety by any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a practical example, we were talking about the mere fact that somebody such as an Attorney-General might deem something to be a lighthouse, an example expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullagar, does not necessarily mean that it has the judicial characteristics of a lighthouse; therefore it cannot be deemed to be a lighthouse simply because the Attorney-General thought it ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also disagreed with the view of McTiernan J. that section 78 only provides a rule of practice and as such is subject to the power conferred on the Justices of the High Court by section 86 of the Judiciary Act to make rules of court regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As long ago as 1918, the High Court held in Alexander’s case that section 72 requires that every <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court and every <span class="highlight">justice</span> of any other court created by the Commonwealth Parliament, and indeed every magistrate so appointed, shall, subject to the power of removal contained in that section, be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has, in consequence, been generally accepted that justices of the High Court, and other Federal judges including magistrates, cannot be required to retire on reaching a specified age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An existing judge will, however, become subject to the retirement requirements of the amendment if, after the amendment takes effect, he accepts appointment to another office of <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the same court having a different status or designation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of a court were, after the amendment took effect, to accept appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of that court, he would thereafter be subject to the retirement age applicable to any <span class="highlight">justice</span> of that court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third referendum Bill proposes to amend the Constitution to provide a maximum retirement age for justices of the High Court and of other Federal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has died in office but they have all retired in the fullness of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is already 73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the puisne or associate justices, only three have retired before they reached 70-Evatt at 46, Williams at 69 and Kitto at 67. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first Federal Judge in Bankruptcy  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lukin, died in office in 1944 at the mature age of 76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are 27 justices of the Family Court of Australia, all appointed in the last year and a few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, still sulking from his rebuff by his brethren in the earlier case, invited a further challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor will it affect the appointment and continuation in office of any present incumbent of Federal courts or the High Court subsequently appointed to a more senior position either by transfer from a Federal court to the High Court or elevation from the Federal courts or the High Court to the position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>;  Mr R.  C. Ward, Q.C., M.L.C., from the Northern Territory, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward; and, last but not least, that redoubtable figure of Australian politics, particularly in the field of local government, the Rt Honourable Alderman H.

  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  announce his present admiration for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I can say that it is with a great deal of joy that I join the Leader of the Opposition in expressing admiration for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the acceptance of this proposition will remove one of the main obstacles to full citizens’ rights to Territorial citizens it will not remove the doubt cast on the validity of Territorial representation which was implied in the remarks of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the recent High Court judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court of Australia- indeed the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick- has considered the question whether the Territories are entitled to elect senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a review is made of the earlier High Court decision in relation to the eligibility of senators from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory sitting in this place one wonders whether, in view of the retirement of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan and of the appointment of another judge, the result will be a definite ‘no’ meaning that those senators are not entitled to sit in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say to the honourable member for St George that I can understand, admire and respect the Government seeking to put the trade union movement of this country in a legal legislative straightjacket if the Government demonstrates some semblance of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> by applying the same legislative straightjacket to companies, stock exchanges, banks, insurance companies and all companies - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government ought to deal with this son of legislation with equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trade union movement was built up by the Labor Party that then was; the Labor Party that saw the great privilege in the corporations and in the aristocracy on the 19th century; the Labor Party that was a great Party because to some extent it brought about social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, if any Australian citizens are in peril let us take the appropriate action before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on thenbehalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a letter which was addressed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, the Commissioner of the Royal Commission on Petroleum, by the former Minister for Minerals and Energy,  Mr Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Royal Commission before  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Neasey the Tasmanian Government and the Transport Commission contended that it was costing an average of $1.63 to carry every passenger on each trip and that the passengers were paying an average of 13c a trip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two pieces of legislation declared invalid in the last couple of weeks by the now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> were introduced as being valid by that same person when he was the Attorney-General of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restrictive practice is about the power of big business in relation to the totality of the economy and somehow we have to intrude government power to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the producer and the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, introduced the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That distortion of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was corrected by the House of Commons in 1906- not by a House of Commons dominated by communists or even by Ramsay MacDonald ‘s socialists but a House of Commons dominated by people from the Reform Club of England, the Liberals, the Lloyd Georges, who saw the travesty of forcing unionists and trade unions to pay damages to an employer against whom they were engaged in a legitimate industrial dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mean significant savings for the majority of Australians, and for those who are the victims of tragic accident or misfortune it will bring a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and security which has never been possible under the law as it stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  C. L. D. Meares, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the  Chairman  of the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped and until recently  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central flaw in the existing schemes is not just their exorbitant cost to the community but their total inadequacy as a system of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March 1973  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was again commissioned, this time by my Government, to report upon the scope and form of a nationwide system of rehabilitation and compensation for all injured persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Federal Government can in <span class="highlight">justice</span> ignore its obligation to explore and develop a new system of compensation and rehabilitation, in consultation with the States and the interests concerned, and remove the intolerable shortcomings of the system as it now stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long must <span class="highlight">justice</span> be denied? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the previous Government established a committee of inquiry into rehabilitation and compensation in Australia under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of course had previously headed a royal commission of inquiry in New Zealand which ultimately resulted in the introduction of an accident compensation scheme in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seems to overlook the fact that an enormous amount of work was done by the 2 gentlemen who prepared the report-  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares, two very distinguished judicial identities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was closely associated with the compensation scheme in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares is a most experienced advocate and is very dedicated to the concept of rehabilitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to write into the legislation the additional provision that they themselves are bound by something this Parliament determines, namely area, can well affect the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly one can really argue from the point of view of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> that as the principle of one vote one value applied in the High Court determination of fixing the quota for States, would not the logical situation be that within the State itself, as far as is practicable, we should as near as possible have equal quotas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there can be a lack of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: ‘If you do not do it the High Court will do it for you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reasonable aspect of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is creating an injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that clause 7 includes a provision relating to electorates over and under5000 kilometres does bring a degree of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and, as my friend the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  said, the parties are in accord on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the pieces of exquisite irony is that in McKellar’s case this month the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> joined in declaring unconstitutional the amendments which, as Attorney-General, he had endorsed when they were put forward by an earlier Coalition Government in February 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the associate justices in McKellar’s case this month unanimously endorsed the view of the Representation Act 1964 which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy had volunteered in McKinlay’s case at the end of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, one has to discard all such considerations of population movement, Aborigines and aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the former Attorney-General, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, spoke very frankly on the 10 per cent variation when, in the Senate on 10 April 1973, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us compare the remarks of the former Attorney-General, the then  Senator Murphy,  later  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, with the reported comments attributed to the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference has been made to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to quote  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the most recent decision, handed down earlier this month, in a case in which an elector of New South Wales challenged the validity of certain sections of the electoral Acts, the Court held that the 1964 amendments to the Representation Act- which, by the way, were introduced by the then Attorney-General, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> permitting an extra seat to be created where the quota was not exceeded by 50 per cent, were invalid, as they were offensive to the precept of proportionality and the nexus requirements of section 24. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clumsy attempt to protect the National Country Party, whose members are still smouldering over their failure to have the loading increased to 20 per cent, will hinder the distribution commissioners in their attempts to bring electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our former colleague, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman)  said just a moment ago, spelt this out during the debate on the 1974 electoral Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition acknowledges the progress that has been made but it assures the people that electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> will only be completely accomplished when the Labor Government takes office after the next federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Kalgoorlie electorate was such a huge size that no member of Parliament could do it <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of- course, is an impossible ideal to achieve, and I challenge members on the Opposition benches to name one country where it has been achieved in terms of their euphemistically named ideal of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How ridiculous it is to talk about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Constitution provides for an original State to have a certain number of members and thereby the Constitution denies electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point I would like to make about the honourable member for Calare is that he said there is no possibility of direct electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the present Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore he says if we cannot have direct electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> we may as well magnify the injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  seemed to get some glee from the fact that perhaps the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> had approved the legislation of 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will find also that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> left this place on about 27 April 1 964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The participating States recognise the universal significance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for which is an essential factor for the peace, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and well-being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co-operation among themselves as among all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister reiterate his statement of 14 November that he would ensure that the Territory legislation accords with Aboriginal wishes and that the Government will not recommend consent to that ordinance if it contravenes the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the metal trades case was before the Commission in May 1975 a fitter was getting an award wage of $26 a week less than he should have received because, ever since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins had tied the fitter’s rate to the carpenter’s rate more than 60 years ago, the fitter’s and carpenter’s margins have been identical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government of course must seek economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all Australians, and this is our essential aim at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Auditors have been deceiving people; trustees have not been acting in accordance with their responsibilities; creditors are coming to members of parliament saying: ‘ Can ‘t I get some <span class="highlight">justice</span>? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I used to walk down Phillip Street and saw the barristers’ wigs I would think that they epitomised the great legal system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that was forged over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Congress will focus world attention on Australian criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> laws and practices and consideration will need to be given to action that might be required to up-date these laws and practices and to bring Australian programs and achievements in the field to the attention of Congress participants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to touch on some of these matters and continue to fight on behalf of all those people in Australia who consider themselves democrats, no matter what party to which they belong, for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of particular importance to the Labor Party because we cannot see our great social reforms go through whatever Parliament it may be, be it a State Parliament or a national Parliament, until we establish electoraljustice in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this House and in this Parliament, electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been delivered to the people by successive Federal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is not a clear indication of an attempt by a Minister to gerrymander, to influence distribution commissioners, to bring about a situation where anything but electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> pertains, I do not know what is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If notice is not taken of the disadvantages suffered by country people in regard to access to their members of Parliament and if notice is not taken of the way in which members of Parliament have to go around to represent them, there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and democracy cannot be brought into this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby is doing some work for the Government in that area, and he is excellent at it but we want to see some progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim should be to ensure economic and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all members of the community, whatever their origins; to reduce or eliminate inequalities of opportunity between social groups; and to protect and enhance the social and physical environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Concern for social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and social welfare and respect for human freedom are fundamental to American values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We acknowledge immediately that their sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> could be different from that of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dovey conducted an inquiry into these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member, however, did himself rather less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> when he was incredulous at the statements made by the honourable member for Batman  (Mr Garrick)  on the economy, inflation and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way in which someone with any sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in his heart could have deliberately ignored it because that report quite clearly, quite strongly supports the proposition that I have been maintaining in this House ever since I got here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious problem is that three-quarters of the Government’s expenditures are now totally committed to maintaining existing programs introduced by the Labor Government which we have not been able to wind down sufficiently to enable the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that these people need to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one has only to go to 1974, while we were in government but while the previous private health insurance program was functioning, to recollect the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke when we set up the fees determination tribunal on the matter of pathology utilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is this <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must come from people who believe in true <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the work force and compassion for those in need, but who believe that actions must be taken to prevent social problems from occurring rather than trying to cure them and hide them once they have arrived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measure of the fairness of a criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system is the manner in which it deals with an accused when he is under suspicion or arrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill represents a practical attempt to translate into our criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system and the procedures of the Commonwealth Police Force, the standards of the Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, it is important that any attempt to translate the language of the Covenant, which is of necessity language of generality, into specific legal provisions should be done with a full knowledge of the tradition of our criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a system, inherited from the common law, in which we can take pride and which has contributed much to the standards of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> which the international community now embraces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one major exception, namely that a dissenting view expressed by  Mr F.  G. Brennan, Q.C, now the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan, has been preferred by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the task of preparing the present legislation, the Government had the benefit of a draft Bill attached to the Commission’s report but it was necessary to depart in a number of respects from this draft Bill, largely in order to incorporate the minority view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These modifications have been discussed with the  Chairman  of the Commission and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan and the Bill attempts to reflect the results of those discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But above all, it proposes that these advances which are now available should be brought to the assistance of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important in matters as vital to the proper operation of the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system as this Bill that proposals for legislation should be thoroughly and carefully weighed before the law is finally enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope he will realise that there has not been, nor should there have been, nor could there have been, and specifically nor was there, any attempt to do anything other than <span class="highlight">justice</span> in respect of this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the many members of the community who will suffer because of this Government’s indifferent and callous approach to social <span class="highlight">justice</span> are the many thousands of young Australians who suffer reading and learning difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This view was expressed in 1944 in an opinion of the then Attorney-General and former High Court <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Dr Evatt,  when he stated that section 25 (2)- a section under which Permanent Heads derive their responsibilitiesmust be read subject to fundamental and overriding principles that the constitutional head of a department of the executive government of the Commonwealth is the Minister of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would go further in Labor’s great and historic concern for the disadvantaged, the underprivileged and the weak- in the primacy we give to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and individual and family security- women may have more to gain from a Labor Government than men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might again take the opportunity to mention that I think there is a certain real element of fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the 4 matters that are in fact being put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in all of these matters there would seem to be an element of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, fairness and reasonableness which I believe will gain them majority support in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox was moved to protest at the misrepresentation by the Government, both in a call which he sought on the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and in a letter to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development which has never been published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of urgent and solemn advice from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues, the Government is blundering heedlessly into hasty decisions and commitments, urged on by the mining lobby and its spokesmen in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>I believe that it is the Labor Opposition which has pre-empted the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about something which I believe and which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his Commission think is the most important issue ever faced in this country, because it is not only a question of what the high level or low level wastes might do to Australians in the mining, milling and enriching of uranium but also a question that can affect the whole of the human race and life on this planet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the seminar <span class="highlight">Justice</span> William O. Douglas of the United States Supreme Court was asked:  Sir, what  is your opinion of the war in Vietnam? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in a judgement of 21 September 1976  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy determined in the matter of Dowling and others: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I would like to place before the House some interesting comments by no less a person than the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of course gave a minority, dissenting judgment in that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> decided to have a second go at the problems he felt arose because there was representation of the Territories in this House and in the Senate he used the McKellar case to invite further challenges to the present law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, having invited a challenge, has now got the challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It raises this serious question of democracy in Australia: Does the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> really think now that he will be able to get a majority of the High Court to overturn the relatively recent earlier decision in the case of The State of Western Australia v. The Commonwealth of Australia that there could be senatorial representation for the Territories? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being said that it is the view of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on his interpretation of the Constitution that representation for the Territories is to be something less than representation for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I agree with the honourable member for KingsfordSmith that it is very dangerous for a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court to be inviting challenges to decisions of that Court only a short time after they have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We ought to be falling over backwards to ensure that we spread ourselves as far as possible to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done in each case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An illustration of how small-minded we are in the administration of these courts is that we have a situation in Sydney where the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in order to preserve the dignity of his Court and its independence, has instructed the chief executive officer of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to lock and to bar a door between the glassed entrances to the Federal courts and the State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Attorney-General to see that his Department takes up with the Supreme Court authorities in New South Wales, and particularly with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, this pettifogging restriction which has been imposed on the movement not only of the profession- after all that is not nearly so important- but of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The independent inquiries on fee determinations which the Labor Government set up in 1973 and 1974, I believe first under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke and under  Mr Mcintosh  in the second case, disclosed that pathologists were certainly abusing the then system of private health insurance to rip off from the taxpayer and to rip off from the public in a quite unconscionable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This objective was basic to the establishment of the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act- seen by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins as ‘a new province for law and order’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Association has agreed to participate in a government initiated inquiry into fees for the year commencing 1 January 1978 and that fee inquiry will be conducted under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would emphasise that we would not be doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to ourselves or to our poorer neighbours if such an intake was to be used to promote the growth of industries which require continuous high tariff protection rather than those which are internationally competitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Privy Council has thrown out the challenge to the validity of the legislation which will bring about a major electoral redistribution in that State and thus end more than 100 years of electoral injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately we have been able to prevent that occurring and there is now a proposal that the old cell block, which is one of the few historical features remaining in the Territory, is to be preserved in a courtyard setting and possibly used as an historical museum, no doubt associated with the work of the police and perhaps with the progress of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members were to look at the particular electorate represented by the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the previous Government, who introduced the legislation which restricted freedom under the previous Government, although admittedly only temporarily, they would find that he was defeated by a lawyer in exile, who was unable to campaign, who had to leave the country but yet received an overwhelming majority in the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the matter is still incomplete and subject to discussions with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen and the other parties if they so wish, there is no point in pursuing this issue until the final declarations have been made and the Government has considered the reasons for any decisions that are given by the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the defendant was employed by a company which contracts for joint AustralianUnited States defence installations will the Prime Minister draw this matter to the attention of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who has been inquiring into the intelligence and security services for him to make an investigation and report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only assume that the National Party Minister for Local Government in Queensland has fallen out of favour with  Mr Joh  Bjelke-Petersen and so will join the former Treasurer,  Sir Gordon  Chalk, the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and a number of others and shortly disappear into the limbo of past Ministers and ex-Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only question for the Court will be whether the action is lawful, in the sense that it is within the power conferred on the relevant Minister or official or body that prescribed procedures have been followed and that general rules of law, such as conformity to the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, have been observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The court may quash or set aside the decision or part of the decision, refer the matter back to the decision maker for further consideration subject to such directions as the court thinks fit, make an order declaring the rights of the parties in respect of which the order relates, or direct any of the parties to do or refrain from doing any act or thing where the court considers this necessary to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One matter with which the Opposition does not agree is the fact that the Government has opted for the minority decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan, as he now is, rather than the majority view of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With great respect to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan, his minority position does appear to be defective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact there are some- albeit very few in Australia today- who are probably innocent but the system is designed to obtain the greatest amount of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the maximum number of innocent persons to go free, and the absolute maximum number of guilty persons to be convicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say that serious related problems were stated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer, I think it was, in obiter dicta when he said that where there were 2 employees of the Crown and the accident to one was caused by the negligence of another there could be serious doubt about the right to take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that in a judgement of 21 September 1976  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy determined in the matter of Dowling and others: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>December 1976, which is known as the Masterman report and appropriate portions of which have already been tabled in this House; secondly, a judgment given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sheppard in Meth and Co.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sheppard that I have mentioned refers to some of the advantages of deeds of arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be seen in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley’s judgment of 2 1 September 1 976 in which he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Riley in this case gave much attention to other matters as they affected  Mr Baume  before he made this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that both the eminent jurists,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sheppard, have found that the deed of arrangement signed by the partners of Patrick Partners on 19 March 1976 are now operating validly, and because they are operating validly they now provide a benefit under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the deed does exist because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley adverted to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley has been referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not so treated before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in the more spectacular cases involving civil rights or the individual’s freedom, the courts were to do anything other than scrutinise in the absolutely closest and most minute detail the entire position, there could be miscarriages of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was put in simply to recognise the fact that there could be odd occasions when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal felt that it was in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that a particular party should have access to the documents or perhaps an intervenor who might be there should not have access to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was appointed the Royal Commissioner by the previous Government to make recommendations on intelligence and security services the nation should have available to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has advised me that the decisions I shall announce will not pre-empt recommendations in the other reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope’s report makes it clear that these arrangements would be in line with similar reforms which have been put into effect in many western democracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In accepting the recommendations, the Government has expressed the ministerial committee’s terms of reference more broadly than those recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stresses that the Government of the day should have available to it an intelligence assessments agency which can provide independent advice on a wide range of matters of national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found that the present arrangements are capable of improvement, and that those who received our intelligence assessments felt that against the tests of quality, timeliness and relevance, Australia’s intelligence production is not as good as it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>When I was Leader of the Opposition the then Prime Minister saw to it that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope informed me of the course of his inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made sure that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope keeps the Leader of the Opposition continually informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is most appreciative of the work done by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in the course of his inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave- Those who have heard the speech of the Prime Minister-  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and those who will read the abridgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report which he has tabled will realise how important and urgent it was that an inquiry should be made such as has now been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join in the : Prime Minister’s appreciation of the work that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has done, painstakingly, com- : petently, in this field, as we expected he would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>anon of the co-operation of the then Premier of New South Wales,  Sir Robert  Askin, and the Chief Justices of New South Wales during that period in making available the services of supreme court judges, not least  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who served twice in conducting inquiries for my Government <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would imagine that we can say that with that appointment and other appointments which have been made- they were made after consultation with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hopethe security and intelligence services of our own country and the relations between those and the security and intelligence services of other countries will be conducted with enhanced benefit to our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we had the wage and salary earners of Australia trying to get some <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commision in terms of a wage increase only to catch up with the price increases in January, February and March of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is utterly inconceivable that either  Mr Mahoney  who, at the relevant time, was head of the security intelligence organisation or  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, would do anything improper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having that in mind and having in mind the evidence that was given by people who attended the coroner’s inquiry, I once again appeal to the Minister to have this matter resolved by a full board of inquiry so as to ensure that not only is <span class="highlight">justice</span> done but also that it is seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will remember the different accounts that were given last November and December by the Minister who represents him in the Senate about the letter which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox gave to him concerning the interpretation that had been placed on the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry’s first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the second report is to be published tomorrow and presumably will be followed by a full parliamentary debate, I make bold to ask the honourable and gallant gentleman: What decision did he make about tabling  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s letter expressing misgivings about the interpretation placed on the first report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Royal Commissioner on Security and Intelligence,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, who was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in August 1974, has recently completed a most extensive series of investigations and reports on all aspects of Australian intelligence and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope has made recommendations to increase the effectiveness of our internal security arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations have already been the subject of detailed study and I shall be making a statement to the House after my return from the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London about the Government’s decisions concerning the Royal Commissioner’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my belief that the DirectorGeneral of ASIO,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, carries out this responsibility creditably and faithfully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition, whose Government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, has recently reaffirmed in the House his confidence in the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I endorse the right honourable gentleman’s tribute to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in my suggestion, is not supposed to carry out any inquiry other than that which he was commissioned by my Government to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and the Acting Director-General,  Mr Frank  Mahony, whom my Government appointed, I would completely endorse the accuracy of all they say and the propriety of all they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best rejoinder to that naive and dangerous belief is to be found in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s third report which was tabled on 5 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believing that any improper activities in Australia by foreign intelligence services should be a cause of the deepest concern to any Australian Government, and endorsing in this context the statement made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his Third Report on Intelligence and Security that ‘Australia’s intelligence interests do not and cannot coincide with those of any other country’; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is utterly unsatisfactory for the Prime Minister to say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has investigated the activities of the foreign intelligence services in Australia and that therefore no further inquiry is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that these allegations had not been made before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope concluded his investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are new charges based on new allegations which were not available to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know, as a result of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s inquiry, how necessary and how prudent it was to have an inquiry into our intelligence and security services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, if the honourable member had read the Press release of the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  he would know as I do that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Yuill was appointed to the Parramatta Court and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cook was appointed in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins said of the arbitration system in 1919: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The customary practice of specialists charging fees generally higher than those charged by general practitioners was recognised by a Commonwealth Committee of Enquiry under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Separate categories of crime could be included, such as armed hold-ups, where justices would be specifically bound to refuse bail except in the most exceptional circumstances with the onus to be on the defendant as in murder cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that there is a strong case at this time for legislation to be introduced for it to be mandatory that a <span class="highlight">justice</span> should record his reasons not only for refusing bail but also for granting it, certifying that he has personally read the accused’s official up-to-date record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Minister that in 1965 in this House an Attorney-General named Barwick introduced legislation called the Representation Bill and this year a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> named Barwick declared that legislation invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On an application to the Federal Court of Bankruptcy by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited to restrain these persons from executing the deeds  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley in his judgment given on 1 April 1976 found that the Bank failed to satisfy the Court that the individual deeds departed from a plan of administration that would be just and equitable and for the advantage of creditors (Re Patrick Partners 10A.L.R.71 at pp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At page 89 in the judgment referred to in the answer to part ( 1 ) of this question  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Riley said that the Bank had not satisfied the Court that ‘the amount that could be recovered under the “preference” provisions in bankruptcy if proceedings under those provisions were successful would exceed the amounts contributed under the deed from separate estates’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Morling,  Q.C., who was appearing for the Commonwealth before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and other members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, was asked by the Bench, before lunch on 4 November, whether the Medibank component of the CPI would be removed for tax indexation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that was a considered answer given immediately after the luncheon break when clearly consultation had taken place with the Government as to what the answer should be to <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Robinson’s question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that is summed up in part of the judgment where  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is saying is that it would not matter what Karen Green did or what efforts she made to find employment; she was going to be denied <span class="highlight">justice</span> by this Government, on the basis that if the Government were to give ground in the Karen Green case, the Government said: We would have to give ground in 35 000 other cases and we are not going to do so’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In response to submissions as to the form of his declaration on 22 April 1977  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said in court, more or less: ‘It is not for me, in the declaration, to tell the DirectorGeneral what he might have regard to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After canvassing the argument that had been put to him regarding the case,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said in his judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Stephen went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who cry that a lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been shown to the Victorian dairy farmers- I am a Victorian dairy farmer- because of the market milk levy overlook the fact that the States jealously retain their power over intrastate milk, the Victorian Government no less than the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hypocritical for a Victorian Minister to claim that lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been shown because the Victorian dairy farmers theoretically cannot take on the Sydney milk market when the same Victorian farmers will be prevented for 10 years by that same Minister from complete access to the Melbourne market and to cry about UHT milk- ultra-high treatment milk- being included in the levy if and only if it is found to be disrupting orderly marketing when Victorian UHT milk has been effectively barred from the Melbourne market for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that raises the important question of whether, if the additional financial return for market milk is not to be equalised, then, as a position of minimum <span class="highlight">justice</span> for southern dairy farmers the quantity of that milk should be included in the national entitlement; that is, that the quantity as distinct from its value should be included or, to put it another way, the butterfat equivalent of market milk produced in a State should be included in the State’s entitlement and the State should then be left to sort out how it will handle the market milk in the provision of an individual farmer’s entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister should be prepared to go against the majority of the States if they are not prepared to concede the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the argument that I have just put on the inclusion of the butterfat equivalent of the market milk entitlement in the national aggregate entitlement, just as that same Minister decided against the State with the majority of production when he introduced the market milk levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who were kind enough to attend this meeting, I must say that a full copy of the proceedings was sent to the Minister and I believe was studied by his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals were developed out of the Government’s consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the independent inquiry into repatriation conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose of the New South Wales Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose recommended that repatriation boards should be abolished and replaced by a system whereby the initial determination of claims should be the responsibility of the Commission exercising its powers through suitably qualified persons acting individually as delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose recommended that, if repatriation boards were retained, the members when appointed should be subjected to an intensive training programme before making determinations, rotation of board chairmen and members should be actively pursued and the boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, the Government has adopted the recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that there should be arrangements for rotation of chairmen and members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also considered the view expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of these provisions is to obtain better co-ordination among boards, to ensure the attainment of a high standard by boards in the discharge of their duties, as suggested by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, but without reducing the independence of each board in the exercise of its determining power under the Act in respect of individual cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose had the following to say in this regard: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose came to the conclusion that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has accepted  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose ‘s conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose reported that there was before his inquiry a considerable amount of evidence that the present section 47 had caused much dissatisfaction and frustration and he concluded that the present provisions of section 47 have proved most unsatisfactory and should be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the repeal of the present section 47 and for the insertion in its place of a much simpler section which will provide that determining authorities: Are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and shall act according to substantial <span class="highlight">justice</span>, taking into account any difficulty that for any reason may lie in the way of ascertaining the existence of any fact, cause or circumstance, including such reasons as the effects of the passage of time and the absence of or deficiency in any official records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to a report headed ‘Corporate Crooks may face summary <span class="highlight">justice</span> ‘ appearing on page 2 of the  Sydney Morning Herald  of Wednesday, 30 March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-56-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission chaired a conference of the parties which resulted in a special redundancy program being introduced into the industry for a limited period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Conference was assisted in its consideration of this matter by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson and Commissioner Neil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the strength of this attitude which will in part determine the sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which the society possesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the outset of my second reading speech, the very need of these people for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in many cases is denied because of their inability to finance their legal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would be denied <span class="highlight">justice</span> if that were the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to look at the whole question of poverty and the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important as far as the Department of Veterans’ Affairs is concerned, and in respect of the method of accepting conditions, that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but must also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week my Party’s welfare committee had a lengthy and very interesting discussion with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and  Mr Kingsland,  who is Secretary of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose carried out the independent inquiry into the repatriation system which concluded in June 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue raised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose which is relevant to the legislation before us is the lack of uniformity in the presentation of cases and in the action of the repatriation boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose reported and what those of us who have been interested in repatriation for some time as a result of helping constituents or ex-members have been aware of is that some deserving ex-members do not get benefits and do not have certain conditions accepted while the cases of others whose conditions have been accepted and who possibly get pensions may not be as deserving or as clear cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though my Party introduced the practice of giving reasons for decisions, I noted when we met  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose last week that some of the people on the boards who give these decisions are not exactly highly trained to make the decisions or to give reasons for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They then went on to make an important point which I am sure is wrong and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, when I showed it to him, agreed with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased when I showed the reasons for decision to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and  Mr Kingsland  that they did not agree with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question of untrained people presenting the cases in many instances with the cases being presented inadequately, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, as the Minister for Environment Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  who is at the table knows, recommended that lawyers ought to be allowed to appear in appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the summary of his report at page 20, paragraph 83,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but must also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that in the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose he said that the Act should be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that the Government has finally started introducing legislation arising from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What also pleases me is the fact that the proposals were developed from the conclusions and recommendations of the independent inquiry into repatriation conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose was correct in his findings that many claims in the past have been presented in an inadequate fashion, as the honourable member for Prospect also said, resulting mainly from a misunderstanding of section 47 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iii some instances this created a feeling of distrust and injustice towards members of a board by some claimants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clarification of this part of section 47 will ensure that, in future, claimants can be assured that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, prepared a large report of 3 volumes, containing many recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose presented this first report in June 1975, nearly 4 years later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not even begrudge the amount if it is going to mean the correction of injustice in respect of the exservicemen of this country or, as we now use the American jargon, the veterans of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well remember the then honourable member for Balaclava,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, and  Dr Evatt  taking a very great interest in this matter and the Returned Services ‘s League bringing forward to this Parliament the Queen’s Counsels’ views on the interpretation of section 47 of the Act, which sets out the onus of proof provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think that the exservicemen of this country regard  Dr Evatt  and a former Attorney-General,  Senator Spicer,  as well as a former honourable member for Balaclava, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, as the great freedom fighters about section 47. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Evatt,  as he was then, referred in  Hansard  in the 1955 to the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Denning in the case of  Miller  v.  Minister for Pensions  in 1 947 when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only statistic I want to mention in complimenting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose on his preparation of the report is the figure he mentioned at the tail end of his opening when he said that approximately 4300 individuals were contacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I belive that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose made a very valid point when he recommended that eventually disability must be based on 100 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That certainly was a recommendation made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what the honourable member for Hughes did not mention was that in paragraph 69  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose made the provision that if boards were not abolished there should be a different set of recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the Government did not accept the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that repatriation boards should be abolished was simply that there was a tremendous weight of criticism made by various ex-service organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was taking a direct recommendation from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose which he posed as an alternative to his original recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only sanction that springs to mind is enforcement of contractual obligation through the international <span class="highlight">justice</span> machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that His Honour <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox was to be appointed adviser to the Prime Minister on nuclear and associated matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his fellow Commissioners were pointing to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox was not asked to make decisions on the development of the economy of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member made it clear to me in his speech this afternoon that his great anxiety was that anxiety that is referred to by  His  Honour <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox and by my colleague the honourable member for Canberra  (Mr Haslem). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we read what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox has to say about the Non-Proliferation Treaty we realise that honourable members who are speaking here against the export of Australian uranium ore should have second thoughts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear from the report of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox that if that were done we would be in breach of the non-proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, and most importantly, it goes a long way beyond the recommendations which were made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in his 2 reports, particularly the first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has recognised that the great issues raised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues in their first report were of such a nature as required the involvement of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  since clearly that would pre-empt the very recommendations which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to commend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs in the case of  Salemi v Minister for Immigration  hold that the Immigration Act did not require the Minister to act in accordance with the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the media and stock exchange speculation which arose in the middle of last month from accounts of cables the Prime Minister received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, which  His  Honour and later the Prime Minister himself described as appalling speculation, I ask whether he will promptly table those cables just as the 2 reports of the Fox Committee were promptly tabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Minister will not exercise his discretion in the way he did when dealing with the representations of an Italian worker,  Mr Salemi  who is still under threat of deportation, notwithstanding that three High Court judges indicated that there had been a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that the other three High Court judges were of the opinion that  Mr Salemi  had been treated unfairly and that the concept of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> did not apply in the administration of the Minister’s decision under the Immigration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has proposed a substantial change in the method of reproducing the judgments of the Court which could make them more readily and more cheaply available to the parties and certain institutions such as Courts, libraries, professional bodies and universities and at a reduced cost to other persons and bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-87-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote to the House an extract from the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sharp in the distilleries case in 1976 in which he was faced with an argument for the application of a stand-down clause in respect of employees when the employer felt that there was not enough work for the employees because of power stoppages or whatever it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 16 August, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  asked me if I would table cables and a letter of 8 November 1976 from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox allegedly concerning media and stock exchange speculation on the Reports of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have examined the correspondence I have received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to take this opportunity to announce that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, with my concurrence, has accepted an invitation to participate in the initial meeting of an International Consultative Group on Nuclear Energy which has been established by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Royal Institute of International Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget- inadequate and misconceived as a response to our immediate problems, negative and destructive in its particular measures, class-ridden in the most profound sense- will drive us further apart from those nations where true progress and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> are pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, before proceeding, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the presiding Commissioner of the Ranger Inquiry,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, and to his fellow Commissioners,  Mr G.  G. Kelleher and Professor C. B. Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then I have appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as adviser to the Government on nuclear nonproliferation and safeguards matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part, I believe that the policy we have developed in this area is second to none and goes beyond the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the comments by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox are significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure you will appreciate our feelings of concern that five innocent Australians could meet their deaths in circumstances which have not only never been satisfactorily explained, but also where the culprits have apparently escaped scot free and have never been brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to be discourteous to a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, nor do I want to be discourteous to somebody I served under. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proceedings involved the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam),  two former Ministers and a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20 April 1977 three of the defendants, that is those defendants other than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, sought legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on the basis of that and on the basis of doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the defendants, that seemed to me to be a proper course to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 5 August I received the following letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your personal involvement in this affair including certain statements in Parliament should as a matter of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> preclude you from acting as Attorney-General in any way against the defendants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I wish to point out that by letter dated S August 1977 the honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy informed me that he has strong objections to my taking over the proceedings if I had the intention to continue them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the light of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s letter and in the light of counsel’s advice, I thereupon decided I should not take over the proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision to intervene and then discontinue the prosecutions had been ‘muddied’ by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s firm opposition to the idea that the Government should step in, they said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was glad to note that the honourable member for Wentworth emphasised that the decisions he made in these matters were his alone and in particular that the decision not to prosecute after receiving  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s letter was his and his alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was one of the counsel for my Government before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the French nuclear tests case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proceedings were dismissed on 2 December 1 974 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lee, who, incidentally, had once sought to enter this House when he stood against me in 1 954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox totally disagreed with the proposal to mine uranium and sell it overseas because of the ‘waste’ problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox recognised that there were problems but, in fact, recommended that there were no real bars to its export from this cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision by the Liberal-National Country Party Government has been preceded by and based on the findings and recommendations of the two major reports by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his fellow commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision to intervene and then discontinue the prosecutions had been ‘muddied’ by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s firm opposition . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A story was leaked out that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox was not in favour of uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  National Times  of 30 July associated the Prime Minister and his office with a lie, because <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox made it very clear in a telegram to his fellow commissioners that that was not so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he had Been shown documents, told that you had threatened to resign, and told also that the Prime Minister wished to see the case against  Mr Whitlam, Dr Cairns,  the late  Mr Connor  and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone is aware that there is a violent minority within Australia which is opposing uranium development regardless of a decision of a democratically elected government which has examined the Ranger reports with great scrupulousness and care and has overwhelmingly followed the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his fellow commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vital and important work that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is doing now on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, as adviser on the way that Australia can best lend its efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, could not have anything like the effect that it will have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia were to remove itself from a position of influence in the various studies that are under way, such as the fuel cycle evaluation and other matters designed to achieve a safer worldand even more stringent matters relating to safeguards- then the work of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as adviser on non-proliferation would certainly be weakened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He shows a lack of understanding of ordinary principles of fair play, correct conduct and natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was incorrect, and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia described it as being an untenable reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three judges were of the opinion that  Mr Salemi  had been denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>; the other three judges said that he had been unfairly treated but that the concept of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> did not apply in the administration of the Minister’s decision under the Migration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, he has been told it by his old chum, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier, in a matter brought by  Mr Salemi  himself, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> reached that conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said he expressed the view in the case of  Mr Salemi  that the power to order deportation under section 18 is not qualified by the necessity to afford a prohibited immigrant natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Minister has a power that does not have to be exercised subject to considerations of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> it is a particularly grave power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Fijian nurses’ case the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said that where a person was a prohibited immigrant the Minister had no discretion under section 18, he had to deport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be remiss of me, as their representative in this Parliament, to slacken my efforts to ensure that in this situation <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would seek the support of all members of this House to apply themselves as best they can to see in this situation that <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision went against him because the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> based his decision on these very technical grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About the same time as we passed the Ombudsman Act we also passed an Act which said that further <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be available for the people of Australia to obtain a judicial review of administrative decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather tragic and rather sad to think that the Government has not promulgated that Act because under section 5 of that Act a breach of the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be the subject of reviewing a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case there has been a breach of the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has Salemi been put in the position of receiving the benefit of the Ombudsman’s review and still being denied the opportunity to obtain a judicial review which could virtually reverse the Minister’s decision on the basis of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the Minister bears the onerous burden of the remarks made about the situation, even by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 9 of his judgment of 1 1 May the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister was the subject of a barb from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to statements that were made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs and particularly to the statements he made about the Minister’s Press statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have this outrageous situation: The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has held that the Minister did not have to follow established principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and the law passed with the approval of both Houses of the Parliament has not been promulgated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law says that if natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been followed we can review the Minister’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jacobs in the same case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court did not question this, the principal question before the High Court was whether I had an obligation to observe the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the court was that I did not have such an obligation but nonetheless I believe I have treated  Mr Salemi  ‘s case in great detail and given it full consideration, and given him in every instance the right to be heard in respect of matters at issue in accordance with the recognised rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So clearly there is confusion in this Government as to the equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of taxation measures and also confusion about when things will be applied and how they will apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hasten to add that local authorities in the United States and Canada have responsibility, of course, for functions such as police and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, health and welfare, housing and urban renewal and in some cases, education which Australia does not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed in his address to the nation that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox recommended that no mining or export of uranium should take place until the safe disposal of waste had been solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his fellow commissioners said was that the present situation with waste was such that it did not justify a decision by Australia not to export uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister for Transport by reminding the honourable gentleman and the House that in September 1974 the Whitlam Government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had stayed there a little longer I would have joined them in their demonstrations criticising the three stupid old judges who reversed the decision and who made clowns of themselves and of the British system of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to assist the royal commission will the Treasurer consider directing the Commissioner of Taxation to provide to the royal commission such information as he has in regard to how people may have acquired money and assets which are disclosed in their income tax returns and which obviously have come from criminal activities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important findings of the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, was that Australia needs intelligence of quality, timeliness and relevance and that existing intelligence assessments do not meet these tests as well as they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a terrible crime in the name of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that metal workers are getting less money now than a Class 4 clerk in the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a travesty of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> that a toolmaker should be getting $60 a week less than a Class 2/3 clerk in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia values highly the work performed by the International Labour Organisation in the labor field and in the promotion of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I have to inform the House that we have present in the Gallery this afternoon the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Committee of the Swedish Parliament, led by  Mrs Astrid  Kristensson,  Chairman  of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> went against him on the issue of law and not on the merits of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People are entitled to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> did not come into the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what I say would be supported by many people who believe in such organisations as the International Red Cross, the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, Catholic Relief, Community Aid Abroad and a large number of members of the Returned Services League who served alongside the East Timorese in World War II when 50,000 East Timorese out of a total population of Timor of only 500,000 fell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1976 the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace published a report expressing grave concern for the welfare of over 500,000 East Timorese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they are wrecking another- but with superb irony and supreme <span class="highlight">justice</span> the Government they are wrecking is their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party knows where truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> lies in South Africa in assisting the blacks to economic security and political enfranchisement and dignity to where they can exercise their human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised this case with the Secretary of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, who had previously held an inquiry, and they both assured me that my interpretation was correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is numbered among those who are suffering for the sake of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These men were portrayed almost as fugitives from <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to look at what is deemed to be the situation we could do no better than to turn to the dissenting judgment in that case by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins who thought that it was perfectly fair and reasonable that the Parliament of the nation fix a retiring age for judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 72 of the Constitution talks about justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we could read into that that if the national Parliament had the power to create other courts it would have the power also to determine retiring ages and, if so, that would apply to justices of the High Court as well because they are referred to in the same section of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins drew a parallel with section 103 of the Constitution which provides for members of the Inter-State Commission to hold office for seven years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could be removed under the same circumstances as justices could be removed under section 72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, nobody in his right mind would expect Prime Ministers or other leaders in this country to be in their 80s, as has happened with many justices of the High Court as a result of the interpretation of section 72 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Barton continued to the age of 71 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs went on to 75 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Powers went on to 76 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich- I will save my comments about him- went on to the grand old age of 87 years but had no active political career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That applied also to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke who had a particular hostility towards the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has announced, as he is entitled to do, that he thought there might be a better method of appointing judges, including High Court judges, by having them appointed by an outside committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This has created great pressure upon government and upon the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that there are three appointed judges -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, the Chief Judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been overseas for reasons well known to the Leader of the Opposition and to honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn is about to go or has gone on sabbatical leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there may be a need to fill some positions on the court, either temporarily or even permanently, depending on the future of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and on the future activity of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I was in Washington in August I met  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has concluded his inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn is no longer available, as the honourable member has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that an ordinance is to be made to permit the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister quite rightly paid tribute to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I believe that there are good economic as well as environmental reasons for sequential development, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his commissioners recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Builders Labourers Federation was brought before the Industrial Court for deregistration  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki had this to say in his judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said when we came into power that there should be <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all that people in Sydney should be able to buy petrol for 14.5c a litre and people in Burketown should have to pay 29c a litre for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make a plea for understanding and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for rural Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some little time ago, as a result of an application made by the Master Builders Association,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ordered under section 45 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act a secret ballot to be held by the builders labourers involved in work on the State Savings Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases in benefits flowing from the fees increases determined by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke should result in increases in family contribution rates of up to 35c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to express the Government’s appreciation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke for the manner in which he conducted the 1977 Inquiry and for his timely presentation of this comprehensive determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Minister has ignored those changed circumstances, hopefully  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke has not and has discussed these factors in his determination because it is very difficult to apportion an exact value to those changed circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point in the answer is the one we find difficulty in dealing with and hopefully  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke got some information from the Commonwealth Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether those factors have been taken into consideration by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke in determining the new fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission will be constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  E. S. Williams of the Queensland Supreme Court and will commence its hearings as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, out of a sense of fairness and out of a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I say that an amendment such as that proposed would deprive these schools of some small amount of assistance which could be given under discretion, and the amendment ought to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In anybody’s language that is a move towards providing great social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has agreed to chair the commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, I requested the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. T. Ludeke, to undertake the preparation of a report on guidelines and possible options for the rationalisation of re tau pharmacies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by quoting from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ‘s report of the inquiry on medical fees which was tabled yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 13 of the report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke refers to the fact that to come to a conclusion on medical fees it was necessary that they should be examined by reference to changes in the medical benefits scheme which have an effect on the income of medical practitioners outside the area of adjustment of fees, where there has been a change which leads to an increase in incomes and where there has been no proportionate change in work loads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Ludeke then goes on <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think that even  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke appreciated the great difficulty that would confront the Department in trying to achieve the profile that the honourable member for Prospect was seeking in relation to the changed arrangements in universal health insurance in this country since the introduction of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the House ought to know that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ‘s determination has resulted in an increase in doctors ‘ incomes of 3.8 per cent for the year 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke determined an average increase of 7.3 per cent, which excludes any increase for pathology fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams is responsible for this investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government in August 1974 appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as the royal commissioner to conduct this inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the abridged findings and recommendations which were tabled in the House demonstrate that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has fulfilled his terms of reference thoroughly and imaginatively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went into the matter with his usual diligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there could be no more important matter from Australia’s point of view than that we have the type of intelligence assessment that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope envisaged, for the elementary reason that if this country is to survive in the present day climate it has to make efficient and effective use of its resources, and it is in the interests of the Australian people that they be so utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in the brief extracts which we have seen from his no doubt voluminous report, correctly divided the intelligence cycle into four sections- direction, collection, processing and dissemination- and I hope that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has noted that definition of intelligence ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope undoubtedly was correct when he criticised our past assessment arrangements as being too much under the influence of the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not quite in accordance with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not disagree with that, but I draw attention to this as an area where the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope have not been followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope put it, ‘assessment calls for a quality of refined judgment on a mass of material about international matters very little of which is clear fact’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in accordance with the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who said in his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, and by far the most helpful, are the abridged findings and recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope as part of his third report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  leant over backwards to be far too fair in his assessment of the Government’s response to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s findings and recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our best starting point in relation to the security interest in this country is one of the statements made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in which he talked about Australia’s national security interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to honourable members the statement which appears in paragraph 40 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s abridged report which we have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Isaacs quoted from the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, without attribution, the words of Professor Trevor Roper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Bill attracts no opposition from the Labor Party in this House, to my mind it is somewhat less than adequate in giving effect to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made no recommendation for the establishment of an agency which had to report to two boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement that he made on S May he said that there were variations in the decisions reached by the Government and the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one does not have to look too far to see that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report is a very strong critique of the role played in the intelligence community in Australia over the last couple of decades by the Joint Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to overlook completely the conclusion reached by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, namely, that there must be an integrated approach to the intelligence assessment function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was at great pains in both of his statements- that of 5 May which was made when he tabled  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s abridged report, and his second reading speech when introducing this Bill- to talk about the independence of the Office of National Assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by paying respect to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope for his very worthwhile report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was able to bring fresh light to bear on an area that has remained too grey, an area about which too many members of this Parliament have had to learn from informed leaks in newspapers, he is to be commended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope summed it up very well and somewhat brutally when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that they have, and that they are doing their homework much better now than they did when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope wrote those remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said that it would be naive to imagine that overseas governments, no matter whether they are our close allies or represent governments with which we deal either in the trade area or diplomatically, will tell us all the information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations are aimed at attaining the introduction of a non-political approach in respect of the assessment of intelligence material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before resuming my seat, I commend  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on his able effort in producing the report which is the basis of this Bill, which I support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s Royal Commission report and the second reading speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  did not envisage any such posts of director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke referred to a September quarter projected consumer price index increase of 3.25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I wish to inform the House that the Government has decided to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large for a period of 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s primary role will be to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox was the Presiding Commissioner of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry established by the previous Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Inquiry completed its final report in May 1977,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, on my request, pursued inquiries overseas relating to nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s advice as important in enabling the Government to pursue the most effective policy against the spread of nuclear weapons which is a matter of great international concern and the most effective arrangements to remove the international instability associated with the spread of sensitive nuclear technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox as Ambassador At Large will be leading the Australian delegation to the opening meeting in Washington on 1 9 and 20 October of the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s leadership will ensure that Australia will contribute to the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation to the maximum extent that its international position and technical expertise in nuclear matters will permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, with his background and experience in this field- so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality of the reports of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- has indicated that he is prepared to accept this task, a task which is most important for Australia and I venture to say for the wider international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with past practice where members of the judiciary have been appointed to executive office, for example, the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward when a Judge of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Industrial Court to be DirectorGeneral of Security;  Sir Owen  Dixon, then a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to the United States, and  Sir John  Latham while Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to Japan, the Government proposes to introduce legislation similar to that introduced on those other occasions to enable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while AmbassadoratLarge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also proposes to introduce legislation to increase the number of Judges of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court from three to four to allow the Court to operate as necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could be no Australian with a greater capacity, and now experience, to represent Australia and put Australia’s case at such international conferences than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now informed that appropriate statutory arrangements will be made- as were made for Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Latham and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, and which are still being made for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might draw something of a comparison with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that his Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is to resign as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is now public and regular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia could not be better represented at these important international meetings than by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, who, I believe, already has secured the respect, indeed the admiration, of all sections of the Australian community and of many people overseas for the way that he conducted the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will serve Australia truly and honestly, as he always has, and I believe that he will make a significant contribution in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the safe distance of New York the Foreign Minister has spoken sanctimoniously about Australia’s unbending commitment to <span class="highlight">justice</span> in southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their attitudes are as damaging to Australia as they are in violation of universally accepted standards of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Prime Minister on his decision which was announced tonight to appoint  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to be the AmbassadoratLarge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday, when we were discussing the tabling of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke’s report on medical fees, I said, after discussing all the difficulties involved in deciding what reasonable medical fees ought to be: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point in the answer is the one we find difficulty in dealing with and hopefully  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke got some information from the Commonwealth Department ofHealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I did not know what was in the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 22, in discussing the sorts of things which ought to be taken into account in deciding by what margin medical fees should be increased,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke said, amongst other things: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke had to make decisions costing the Australian public, via the funds, private contributions and Medibank taxation, $67m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another interesting point arose from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ‘s statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indexation, when it existed under the Whitlam Administration- the indexation that this Government promised to abide by- provided <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all wage and salary earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfair to cast aspersions on electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> or decisions made as to what ought to be the tolerances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of the continuing consideration of the report on repatriation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, I believe that it is necessary to consider the introduction of new legislation to review the appeals system at present in use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s emasculated version of Labor’s Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1975 is far short of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cabinet decided that written proposals for alternative uses for the land- proposals which conflict with the Aboriginal claims- should be presented to the Land Rights Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox reported that the development of mining would have a profound impact on traditional Aboriginal societies, particularly during the construction phase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is surely simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> and must receive the approval of us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition also spoke in regard to the Borroloola land claim now before  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, the first Aboriginal Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Tribunal headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  W. Campbell, a distinguished law practitioner from Queensland, has made an error. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand public servants wanting to retain that relativity but at the same time in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the judges of this country it was necessary to break that nexus, and the nexus has been well and truly broken in the last 12 to 18 months and particularly in relation to the setting up of the Federal Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, at the time of his appointment he was a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales he was receiving a higher salary than in fact he received when he became a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have the precise figures in front of me, but the fact is that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Queensland still receives more than the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very high salary having regard to the fact that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court is now receiving something in the $55,000 bracket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that this is a time when leaders of the trade unions directly involved and the Australian Council of Trade Unions would use their own best judgment to protect the arbitration procedures of this country; to protect the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which does stand as the third and impartial umpire in relation to these matters and which is capable of making a judgment between employers and employees in a way that is fair and protects <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the national interest- the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop reported to me early in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop ‘s report indicated that whilst all of the organisations and parties who made submissions to him agreed that the existing arrangements should not be allowed to continue, there was a sharp division between those who proposed that the Government should take a more direct role in the industry and those who believed the Government should seek to withdraw from its already limited regulatory role to enable the parties in the industry to assume more responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill was foreshadowed in the statement to Parliament by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 6 October when he announced the Government’s decision to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In announcing that decision, the Prime Minister mentioned that the Government would be introducing legislation to enable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while he is AmbassadoratLarge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox is at present the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and he is also a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with the legislative action that was taken to remove any doubts that the diplomatic appointments of  Sir John  Latham and  Sir Owen  Dixon in 1940 and 1942 respectively, and the appointment last year of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, may have had on their judicial offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that while  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is holding his appointment as Ambassador-at-Large he will retain his entitlements to remuneration and annual allowance that he would have had as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large comes to an end he will retain his position as a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia and he will be entitled to remuneration and annual allowance on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It remains only for me to endorse what the Prime Minister has already said about the importance which the Government attaches to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s proposed appointment as AmbassadoratLarge and to  His  Honour’s pre-eminent qualifications for the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that we will have to review the conditions that apply and make them more generous so that they give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who have assumed responsibility of local ownership and at the same time encourage those who are hesitant about adoption of the policy to take the step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the commitment to legislation of an on-going program for equity for the pensioners of this nation is recognised by the pensioners who have benefited from the Government’s thoughtfulness and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in its program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently, in Tasmania, we have seen an injustice very similar to that described earlier this evening by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in a situation where two young, dedicated, hard-working trade union leaders have been persecuted, convicted and crucified by the Tasmanian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To wrap it up in a speech of tribute to Cardinal Gilroy, with the greatest of respect, did less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to what the honourable member ought to have said about the late and great Cardinal Gilroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my very good friend, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Upper House, is wont to put it, for the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> poverty is a crime and wealth is a virtue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an anomaly, I suggest, in the law which must certainly be looked Unto if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister seen reports criticising  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation be given wide powers to protect Australia’s security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that such reports have already been issued because I believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went into these matters with a great deal of care and a greaf deal of concern for the civil liberties of Australians, as one would expect, and I would believe that was one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition, in his time, in government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to examine Australia’s security intelligence services- not just ASIO but the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be emphasised that in the fourth report concerning ASIO  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s basic finding was that Australia needs and should have a security intelligence service to investigate and provide intelligence about threats to the internal security of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report on this area of subversion said: … the two main communist parties, the Communist Party of Australia and the Socialist Party of Australia, have strong influence in some unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second relates to the quality of the judiciary which presides over courts, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, and the necessity for <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done not only in the passing of sentence on persons who are found guilty but in respect of persons who are charged and kept in custody for months waiting for those charges to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  announced the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as an ambassador at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that the problem had been brought about by a combination of factors, one in particular being that the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, had been acting for a considerable period in the Ranger inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated by the Prime Minister, who issued the Press release about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, that two new judges would be appointed in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General said that one of the existing judges,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, would postpone his retirement for three months and that it would take time to find a replacement for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill appointing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as ambassador makes provision for preserving his status, whether he resigns or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that while the Family Law Act remains in its present form with all the imperfections that can occur in the adrninistration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, some very tragic miscarriages of <span class="highlight">justice</span> are likely to occur simply because of the way in which the Act was ultimately passed and because of the lack of consideration of some of the points that were made in the debate on the legislation when it was before Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is of eminent background and well fitted to carry out those tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a disappointment to the people in the Australian Capital Territory to think that this matter was not considered on that basis when the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the establishment of port conciliators to deal with the disputes on the job as they arise seems, to be a decided improvement and, indeed, has been adopted on the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson and Commissioner Neil of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it came into office the Government had before it the report presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, as he subsequently became, reported to the Government in early 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step in the industry being restructured by the Government was to ask  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to bring the parties in the industry together in conference to consider ways of overcoming the problem of surplus labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was to give common <span class="highlight">justice</span> to men who had worked a lifetime in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry dragged on until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby finally released the final report on 5 April 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Authority, albeit a government run authority, worked with some success and brought stability to the waterfront up until 1967-68, when an inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended that significant changes be made to the conditions of employment of waterside workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report was taken up at a later stage by an inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, during this Government’s period in office, which finally reported in April 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also remind honourable gentlemen opposite that it was achieved not only as a result of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby and  Mr Northrop,  Q.C., now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, that there should be direct negotiation and direct consultation between employers and employees; it was also accepted unanimously by the Waterside Workers Federation to work in a private enterprise situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there again if we were to take the honourable member for Wilmot seriously, as Tasmania is to the south of the continent- it is separated by water from the mainland- following his reasonable line of thinking and trying to do him <span class="highlight">justice</span> he would have to say that that scheme should not operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than expend the Minister for Overseas Trade on the barricades so erected, the special Minister can apply himself, persistently, to the task of finding the chinks m the EEC armour so that eventually reason and <span class="highlight">justice</span> may prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resident Judges of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court are the Chief Judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to resign from the Court has already been announced  (Hansard,  6 October 1977, page 177S) and it is anticipated that the person appointed to fill the vacancy thus created will then be available for full time service to the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nobody ever doubted the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this action will be hailed throughout the Australian community as a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he recall that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, in his recently concluded inquiry into doctors’ fees, assumed a 3.2S per cent increase in the consumer price index for the September quarter and based his findings, in part, on this assumption? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will the Minister therefore ask  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke to re-open the inquiry and save Treasury and the contributors to private health funds a significant proportion of the $65m increase recently wrongly awarded to the medical profession? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The figures used by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke were only indicative figures, as indeed they only could be when the inquiry was being held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any over-estimate on the part of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, these over-estimates will be taken into account in the inquiry that will take place next year for the setting of fees for 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the Government and the Australian Medical Association agreed that they would abide by the determination of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke with respect to medical fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be noted that since this minute was drafted by the Department of Foreign Affairs as a record of discussion, there have been many discussions between  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and experts overseas about these matters and I know he has put views forthrightly and constructively, seeking a better and an eversafer international environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The implications for Australia’s policy on uranium production and nuclear safeguards of the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox released yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is speaking of is the most vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox describes what has happened and suggests a positive policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak now of  President  Carter’s policy to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox directed his first remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy, which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said was now becoming ambiguous, had two main points: Firstly, the prohibition of the processing of the nuclear fuel from reactors and, secondly, the suspension of the program for what is known as fast breeders or power breeders which make more fuel than they consume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has said in the conference which has been reported, that other countries are resentful of what the United States is doing and they think that this is spragging their own nuclear development and doing them harm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know- this report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox makes it very plain- that no system is or can be watertight in regard to nuclear material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that regard that the positive contributions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, as outlined in this report now before us, are most important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in a way it is fortunate that the report has now been leaked- the circumstances of its leaking are reprehensible enoughbecause these rather sound views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will now be able to be considered by this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has never denied, because it is in the report of the inquiry, that the Ranger inquiry chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox concluded that there are defects in the existing safeguards arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the point of conclusion of the document recording  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s views? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was left to an honourable member on the Government side to ask the Prime Minister a question and, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition knows, he was able to indicate that ten days ago, long before the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition became the recipient of stolen property, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox had written to the Government indicating that he found himself in almost complete harmony with United States officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That document dealt with a three hour discussion between senior government officials and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When talking to officials,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said that in the United States he had found the Carter non-proliferation policy to be ambiguous and uncertain and that there were widely divergent views within the administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report also states that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said there was concern about the ability of the International Atomic Energy Agency to administer the safeguards satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister makes the point that we have to be sure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only is done but appears to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the performance of its functions under this Part, the Tribunal shall act fairly and impartially and shall observe the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 find it hard to believe that if one is to set up a tribunal one is going to presume that it will not act fairly and impartially and will not observe whatever are supposed to be the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the words ‘fairly’ and ‘impartially’ at least had connotations of the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My mind sometimes boggles a bit when I find written into statutes what are called the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister is speaking on the amendment he might like to indicate what are the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it not in the clause with which we are now dealing if the Government thinks that it is necessary that, in the performance of aU its functions, the Tribunal shall act fairly and impartially and shall observe the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, whatever they may be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government intend to adopt the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to define ‘suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis’ in the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-56-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I refer the Prime Minister to the claim made in the parliamentary debate yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the brief held by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, which I made public, corroborated the Government’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does the Government share  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s belief that the non-proliferation policy of  President  Carter and the Carter Administration would not succeed and was resented by Japan, major western European countries and many Third World states? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox had given me approval to quote one sentence from a letter which he had written to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yesterday, in answer to a question from my colleague the honourable member for Prospect, the Minister for Health admitted that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke had granted to the medical profession an award greater than that which was justified by the consumer price index increase and that he did not propose to appeal against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Prime Minister was giving an answer to the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Moore)  in which he .quoted a letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally, and I believe this Government, have a vision of an Australia where social <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall prevail and the needs of all underprivileged members of our community will sympathetically and effectively be cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it can be fairly said that the present Federal Liberal-National Country Party Government has done more to bring social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian community than any preceding government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electors of the division of Wills exercise <span class="highlight">justice</span> and retire me instead of exercising mercy, I will go out on a pension equivalent to three-quarters of our salary; that is, about $18,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Over a lifetime the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  has fought to ensure that an injustice would be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the twilight of his days in the House of Representatives he has had the opportunity to compliment the Government on implementing this notable reform in the area of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  a man of compassion and concern for the underprivileged, is on record on many occasions advancing the proposition that, in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, lone fathers should have the same entitlement as lone mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the National Country Party are delighted that the Government has seen fit to spread the umbrella of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to include people who have been discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was an idea in the mind of one person originally has been taken, hammered and chiselled into shape so that in the final analysis <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done a most deserving sector of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember that he established the Karmel Committee that guaranteed that there would be a Schools Commission and that <span class="highlight">justice</span> perhaps could appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it abundantly clear to this House and to the nation as a whole that the Government is determined to do everything possible in this field to reduce the menace of the drug problem in Australia and particularly to bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> those people who are trading off the health of other people, those people who are trafficking in drugs and as a result destroying the lives of many Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is superficially concerned with environmental and human <span class="highlight">justice</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be going out into electorates to try to entice the people to see otherwise than do honourable members opposite and to encourage them to return people who represent the forces of progress and <span class="highlight">justice</span> as do members on my side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You,  Mr Speaker,  did yourself less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> when you said last night that I had administered a father of a hiding to you in an election in which we were opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to categorise that as being some kind of selective fiddle for the benefit of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and other people in the community is, I think, doing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the office which the honourable gentleman now occupies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until 11 November 1975 a majority of our people always believed that social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and reform could be won by constitutional means per medium of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am beginning to doubt now that it is possible to bring about social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and reform through the institution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that he will perform his task with a very great sense of fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So any party in Australia that departs from giving a fair go, from making a fair distribution of resources in Australia, whether it be under doctrines of socialism or whether it be under doctrines of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, will be rejected and it certainly deserves and ought to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a Labor Party, whether it is based upon a sense of socialism or social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, has to live with its past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian electorate, that past should not be allowed to be forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could indicate that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy is one such person who receives, as I understand it, a full High Court salary and a parliamentary pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the pension is that, however long or short a time the Governor may have held his office, on retirement he has the same pension as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia has on retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government even failed to provide  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke last year with figures freely available on increased doctors’ incomes to argue against increased medical charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was never put to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what way has the Government protected and enhanced the rights of migrants to equal opportunity, equal education and equal access to social <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 point to the report of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White- or, as those who seek to denigrate him refer to him,  Mr Acting <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> White- states about those records that about half of the judges of the Supreme Court were included; all Australian Labor Party parliamentarians were included; very few Liberal Party or National Country Party parliamentarians were on record; no heads of government departments were on record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot follow that sort of reasoning, nor could  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has considered and accepted the basic conclusions of the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on intelligence and security and is acting to ensure his conclusions are put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premier of New South Wales has agreed to make  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope available to carry out this review, and I thank him for his prompt cooperation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that honourable gentlemen will all know of the work that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has done previously on behalf of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, however, concluded that a review conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope would be the most effective and appropriate way to proceed, and that the terms of the review embrace the very proper concerns of the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be empowered to undertake a fully comprehensive review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the broad areas which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will examine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of any legislation as a result of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s review will present the opportunity for parliamentary examination of the relevant issues as, of course, will the debate on this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will be a preliminary step by departments and by Ministers because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be reviewing whatever measures departments entertain at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review to be undertaken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope does not detract in any way from the responsibility of Ministers, permanent heads and their departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall in this context the statement in the Rockefeller reports on the Central Intelligence Agency quoted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his Fourth Report on Intelligence and Security: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one part of the statement the Prime Minister referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and to an inquiry which he will set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find myself thoroughly disturbed because earlier in the statement he enumerated a number of things which the Government has positively in train, yet later he outlined a number of things into which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will inquire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the matters which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will consider will include relationships between State, Territorial and Commonwealth police, and between law enforcement agencies, intelligence and other relevant civilian authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was not talking about something that is to be considered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope; he was talking about a commitment that he has already made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the two strands which I have mentioned come together- the fact that he has made this decision, presumably without consulting the States, and the fact that he has gone on to appoint a commission of inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope with terms of reference which are completely undermined by the firm conviction that he has already arrived at and the course of action upon which he has already set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the matters which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be considering will be: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand why he then wants to set up an inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope into matters which he obviously expects to have under way and well advanced long before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be able to report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the later requirements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand the Prime Minister is making it quite clear that he has firmly decided upon certain courses of action and, on the other hand, he is proposing that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope should be charged with the responsibility of whitewashing what the Prime Minister has already decided to set in train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if the Government wants  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to hold any inquiry then it should set up an inquiry headed by him to find out just what did happen at the Hilton Hotel on Monday morning of last week, how it happened and who was responsible for the obvious failures in the general nature of security at that hotel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worrying that while the Prime Minister concludes his statement by proposing an inquiry by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope, he commences the same statement by making it abundantly clear that the key elements of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope’s inquiry have in fact already been determined by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that spirit of co-operation will be pursued through the investigations and inquiries that will be conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I spoke to  Mr Wran  in relation to that he readily agreed with the sentiments that I have expressed in this House: That nobody could conduct that inquiry better or more effectively, with proper purposes in mind, than could  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">justice</span> is where it should be, it must be appreciated that with all the advances and technical improvements that have been made coal miners still have a hazardous existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is improper for  Sir John  Kerr, why is it not improper for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation fame? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What qualification did that give him for a subsequent job or for keeping his parliamentary pension and being paid as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 he was appointed Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir John Kerr voluntarily left the position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at the age of 59- the normal retiring age is 70 years- to become GovernorGeneral at the invitation of a former Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr E. G. WHITLAM By the same token,  Sir, the  Governor-General was given a pension similar to that of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> so that he could act without fear or favour because he knew that in retirement he would have an ample pension which would not require him to seek other employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Acting Speaker,  let me refer you to the findings not of a party select committee or of any particular party but of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White in his initial report on Special Branch Security Records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White had this to say in paragraph 16.1.2 of his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, whom we appointed recently to the Medical Fees Tribunal, with the cooperation of the AMA sets only the benefits that we would pay for services that the medical profession offers to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What it receives will have to represent wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With some assistance from my friend the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  I must say, with regard to honourable members opposite and assessing the remuneration that they should receive, that I am prepared to support the principle of mercy rather than <span class="highlight">justice</span> where they are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen will deal with the question of pecuniary interests of members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bitterness of the attack, especially in another chamber, since  Sir John  left the protection of the office of Governor-General, has shown that the Labor Party still blame him, when in logic and in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, they should be blaming themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is to be a point of principle, it should equally have been applied to appointments such as that of  Senator Murphy  to the High Court, and  Mr Barnard  to an ambassadorship or to any aspirant to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are others who believe  Sir John’s  actions in 1975 to have been proper and necessary, but who now want to pass him by, who want to forget he ever existed and deny him the possibility of service, I can only ask them to ask themselves how much <span class="highlight">justice</span>, how much fairness there is in that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the report on motor vehicle safety that the Committee presented in June 1976 it recommended, as had  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares’ Expert Group on Road Safety, the establishing of an independent road safety and standards authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, such a provision would certainly not meet the requirements of common <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the case of a person found to be in breach of the legislation who could be subject to six months imprisonment or an updated fine under this legislation of $ 1 ,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Isaac Isaacs was the first member for Indi, holding the seat from 1901 until 1906 when he became a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, and Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in 1930. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Government, this certainly is one of the aims that the Government has in view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trouble was that  Sir John  Kerr had also been Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason of the High Court of Australia recently remarked that the defects and deficiencies of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act had been apparent for a long time and yet the Government has made no move to plug the loopholes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the cost of getting wages to more people means lower real wages to some people, that is in effect a far greater degree of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> than ever took place under the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, this is another argument which supports the Opposition’s stand that the amendment ought to be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, the conflict between departmental convenience and the imperative that <span class="highlight">justice</span> both be done and be seen to be done became clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided that this question should be one of the matters expressly referred to the inquiry on conflicts between public duty and private interest, which is about to be undertaken by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is keen to put the proposition that not only should <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done but also that it should be seen to be done in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis it would appear that <span class="highlight">justice</span> may not have been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We take up the Prime Minister’s statement that not only should <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done but that it should be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My electorate is one of the first to feel the chill of a government which puts social <span class="highlight">justice</span> at the tail end of its priorities- a government whose harsh policies are actually fermenting social disorder, a government which directs its public servants in the welfare area to stick to the letter of the law and to throw compassion and decency to the wind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not too late for Australia to change her course of action and at the very least to insist that International Red Cross should be admitted into East Timor and that the brutal murderers of the five Australian journalists should be brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span> for their foul crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say ‘insist’, I believe Australia should insist that International Red Cross should be permitted into East Timor and those murderers brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being so, it was a question of <span class="highlight">justice</span> being seen to be done as well as being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> and propriety in my suggested course of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner did nothing for eight years, in effect, while allowing these schemes to proceed- schemes the merit and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of which are such that the Government has removed the liability for the payment involved as at 2 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I deal now with another matter which concerns telephone services, which I have advocated and on which I hope to receive the support of every honourable member in this House when they consider the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, at the end of the same parliamentary session in 1965, the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> announced the ‘180 day clause’ Act which authorised ‘protective’ detention of state witnesses and forbade the courts to interfere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a short time of its introduction, the South African Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> used the powers granted to him under the Act to order the preventative detention of more than 130 people regarded as critics or offenders of the South African policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Police,  Mr James  Kruger, has the power to issue banning orders without preferring charges in court and without giving any reasons therefor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government should have a look at the matter and give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the industry otherwise, as I have mentioned in this short speech, it will go out of existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out to the  Speaker  of this House my concern about the fact that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisationthis is clearly the case from the evidence collected by  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White- regarded every member of the Australian Labor Party in every parliament of this nation as a potential threat and had collected dossiers on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It finally came to a decision in the interests of the Australian taxpayer that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only should be done but also should clearly be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we regard court fees as being somewhat of a tax on <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal action is a part of the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and there should not be a tax on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This strikes at the heart of what we are talking about, that is, should not <span class="highlight">justice</span> be available to all irrespective of means? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why that policy decision was adopted apparently was the general position that that party takes, namely, that the courts should be open and available to all, even those who cannot, from their own funds, afford to approach and to use the courts to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that a wide ranging legal aid scheme is operating within Australia under the auspices of the Federal and State governments and a series of private organisations to enable people who do not have their own means to approach and to use the courts to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we should have the right of control over the highest form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view it is proper that those litigants who can afford it should make some payment towards the general cost of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court has been changed this has not been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This system has sought to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all to the extent that there can be no excuse for people thinking that as a moral right they can avoid what they believe to be an unjust tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before exposing the inadequacies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations, let me examine some of the abuses of power as outlined in his report regarding ASIO’s operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 116 of volume 1 of the fourth report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said in relation to ‘particular principles of propriety, including legality, to which ASIO should have regard in fulfilling its functions’ that ‘material before me establishes that there have been departures by ASIO from these principles’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope accuses ASIO of acting with impropriety and illegality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is particularly damning that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope should make the startling statement that over many years ASIO has been allowed to operate without guidelines or questions of propriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the fourth volume of the report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer briefly to the report of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White into the operations of the South Australian Special Branch of the Police Department which, of course, correctly resulted in the dismissal of the South Australian Commissioner of Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White found that there were a number of irregularities in the South Australian Special Branch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was constrained to say in his fourth  report,  volume I, paragraph 90: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The involvement of any other organ of the State- that is, ASIO and /or the military- should, according to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, ‘be concerned only with politically motivated terrorism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A definition of ‘terrorism’ proper must, in the view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, include: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, even  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recognised that even in times of national threat care must be taken with civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his fourth report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most dangerous of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations are those which seek to provide legislative confirmation of the already dictatorial powers of the Director-General of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had the gall to devote eight paragraphs of his report to a consideration of the extent to which the DirectorGeneral may be subject to ministerial control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of this consideration  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope came to the amazing conclusion that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from a report that is worth reading by all honourable members, a report of the Brotherhood of St Laurence titled  Rough <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  which describes the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my belief, one of the great social liberties and one of the great social justices in Australia- this was proved under a Labor reign- was that everybody in this country, no matter what his social or economic background, should have equal opportunities in health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government’s respect for civil liberties and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> is such that it is dismantling Medibank before our very eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suggestion that this and other documents (including notes of a conversation between  Mr Fraser  and  Mr Moyes  on December 22) disclose other reasons why  Mr Fraser  blocked the contract- apart from the stated one that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must appear to be done- cannot be allowed to persist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All in all, it is a very sad performance on the part of the Government if this is the best of which it is capable in trying to give some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people who live in distant areas and who live under the hardships or, as they say, the tyranny of distance from the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude by urging the House to give careful consideration to the value and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention briefly to that report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins delivered to the Parliament in April 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Part XVII-‘A System of Administration’,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I continue with the areas in need of reform as summarised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins repeatedly lashed at the organisation of the petroleum industry in Australia, and it is a positive pleasure for me to be able to join in the attack as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We can bring down comprehensive legislation along the lines recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alan Hockey told me that, in all the years that he had been dealing with the State, he felt that the Queensland Government had dealt with him and his community- his words were-‘with compassion and <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the unfortunate situation that the Aboriginal people who might have come here in the hope of receiving some <span class="highlight">justice</span>, compassion and understanding from this Government are really in a situation in which what they are being given is contained in a very limited exercise indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission made the point that there must be some understanding of what can be done now to assist the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The laws which govern the admissibility of evidence in the courts of this country are vital to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A corrupt government could completely unbalance the scales of <span class="highlight">justice</span> by rigging the laws of evidence, and I believe it is fundamental- I commend the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition on his very considered speech with respect to this Bill- that we should look at all aspects of this matter to ensure that we are not doing with the best intentions anything which might result in an injustice to any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would not be a member of this Parliament who would willingly vote for any legislation which might unwittingly and unintentionally do somebody a very grave injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as this Bill cuts across the time-honoured hearsay rule, it is important that we consider it carefully and ensure that, in our desire to make the working of <span class="highlight">justice</span> more easy and to facilitate the proof of facts by the production of records rather than by the calling of a large number of witnesses, we do not do something which will cause in some future proceedings grave injustice to some person, company or any other group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the courts in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that in the application of this legislation they be very, very careful- as indeed they always are- to ensure that undue weight is not given to a particular document whereby a balance which should be there disappears and an injustice occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer in a moment to a judgment of  Sir Harry  Talbot Gibbs, a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, in Driscoll v. The Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that that judgment ought to be read by all persons interested in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that context, with the consent of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  I would seek to read and thereby have incorporated in  Hansard  an extract from the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs in the case of Driscoll v. The Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recorded on page 742,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons, it would appear to me that in all cases in which an unsigned record of interview is tendered the judge should give the most careful consideration to the question whether it is desirable in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that it should be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy went even further, and I agree with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, whilst supporting the legislation, I would hope that for the next two or three years the courts in administering this new law should lean over backwards to use it only where injustice would be caused if it were not used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided the courts use it only when necessary and provided the safeguards to which I have referred are borne in mind, I believe that this is legislation appropriate to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the twentieth century which I am personally proud to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That seems to offend against the principle of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, with the greatest of respect to him, I say that he did less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his brief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I finish my answer by saying that members of the Greek community in Sydney have distinguished themselves by their efforts to assist the investigation because they, like all other Australians, feel that, if fraud is being perpetrated, they as individuals need to assist the authorities to bring the perpetrators of that fraud to <span class="highlight">justice</span>, no matter what their ethnic background may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How in Capricornia the division of major communities and cities at either end of electorate is considered electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> completely escapes me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a broader context, our budgetary policyand this has been stated over and over again- is a return to full employment and economic growth in the context of greater social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not interested in the welfare of the working people of Australia or in sound Budget planning or in the interests of the aged, the young, the business people, the people who make the money so that we as a government can afford the programs we are trying to implement as regards greater social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer him to the fact that he is on record as saying that he always wishes to have <span class="highlight">justice</span> appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it should be established for reasons of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on the basis of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span>, there is quite clearly a need for an inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I also remind the Prime Minister that during the IBMFacom affair he stated quite frequently that  Mr Harragan  may not have behaved improperly but that it was important to see whether <span class="highlight">justice</span> appeared to have been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: How does it appear that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done when the Government has refused to conduct an open judicial inquiry in which immunity can be given to witnesses called and evidence can be subject to cross-examination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Time and time again this House has heard that statement that the basis of the intervention by the Prime Minister was so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> would not only be done but also would be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share the view that in the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> it would be far better if  Mr Armsden  and  Mr Isaacson  had their cases dealt with separately from the further question of the reconsideration by the Committee of the whole question of parliamentary privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has a nomination been put forward to the group on behalf of the Government on any of those occasions; if so, did the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> refrain from participating in the group’s deliberations, as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon refrained from participating in the then national group’s deliberations on nominations for the triennial elections in 1957  (Hansard,  19 March 1957, page 13 and 22 May 1957, page 1894). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox himself finally admits, the theory that this waste can be stored in geologically stable formations is extremely debatable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we debated the results of the inquiry conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox into this important matter, the sorts of arguments that we have heard tonight, mainly centred on the problems of waste and safeguards, were all raised then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These failures reflect the Government’s contempt for the informed opinion of the members of the Inquiry, which was headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, as well as the conscientiously held views of the public with respect to the hazards of uranium mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think also that the Government should realise that amending legislation to gain a short term relief in our balance of payments crisis or for any of the other purposes which have been brought forward during the debate, such as to promote the accelerated processing, mining and export of uranium, should not take precedence over <span class="highlight">justice</span> to our oppressed indigenous people, which is the theme which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs very rightly has stressed from the outset of his accepting the Aboriginal Affairs Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my purpose to argue that that right to <span class="highlight">justice</span> should take precedence over any supposed urgency to promote a package of uranium Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have examined the possibility of propelling the Broken Hill City Council into court for denying natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a trade unionist and an ex-member of the merchant marines who, on anyone’s say so, has done nothing wrong and has given long, loyal and valuable service to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith overturned the election result and ordered a fresh election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not quite know what they did in Leichhardt- they seem to have made an error there- but in Grey they rallied to the cause of truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and progress and supported my friend the sitting member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable members want to deliver proper political <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Aboriginal people of Australia, I suggest that they should read the specifications set out in 1973 by the Steering Committee on the establishment of the National Aboriginal Consultative Council, published in a very important document- the submission I made to the Public Accounts Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian people and that an ageing population growing at zero growth is not in the best interests of this country’s contribution to the prosperity of its own people and the South East Asian region and that, therefore, policies be adopted concerning immigration and the Australian family, which remedy the present trend of events having regard to the development, employment and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> obligations of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to immigration and to the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> circumstances of immigration programs developed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, for a whole host of social and hard economic reasons, I ask the Government to be bold in relation to immigration, and to be bold with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three matters of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> which I would ask the Government to consider in relation to its migration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as between the child born to an Australian family and the child born overseas who is to be a migrant to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> must exist between the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely say: Consider <span class="highlight">justice</span> as between an Australian family and a migration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government to consider what it might do in respect of the deposit gap for young marrieds who have the care of children, at the same time as it looks at a new and bold immigration policy that might be implemented with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against these criteria, to have three judges sitting where there are no compelling reasons for matters to come before a full court, is clearly a waste of judicial resources and an unnecessary expense in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right of effective access to <span class="highlight">justice</span> has emerged with new social rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effective access to <span class="highlight">justice</span> can thus be seen as the most basic requirement, the most basic human right, of a system which purports to guarantee legal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was explained to them that a decision on Australia’s prior consent in relation to reprocessing was not possible pending the outcome of international discussions including the discussions at the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and the Australian delegation are playing, as I believe, such a constructive role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman suggests that selective stimulus designed- I think I do him <span class="highlight">justice</span> in saying this- to improve productivity through greater utilisation of unused capacity might help just as much as reducing real wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I draw the attention of the House to the High Court judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs in 1923 in which he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no remedial Act which does not affect some vested right, but, when contemplated in its total effect, <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be overwhelmingly on the other side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that the present and recent members of the High Court, with the odd exception, have had little regard to the dictum to which I referred earlier enunciated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs in 1923. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, they seem to have ignored the effect of their’ decisions on the community as a whole and thereby dealt a severe blow to social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well remember that, not so long ago, we had to deal with a case concerning whether there could be political interference with the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the senior law officers of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want an argument even more impressive, let us turn to the opinions of probably the greatest <span class="highlight">justice</span> ever appointed to the High Court, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Owen Dixon, a man very well known to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not class tax avoidance in the eyes of the learned <span class="highlight">justice</span> as something that should be frowned upon, nor does it suggest that the person who does avoid tax should be frowned upon for making someone else carry his burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The learned <span class="highlight">justice</span> called it an ingenious trick and said, ‘however unappreciative his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Curran decision was a majority decision, with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies constituting the majority, and with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen dissenting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that the approach by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is not unusual, as he appears to put to one side all High Court precedents in tax cases, particularly those relating to section 260. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs once said, it is better that the High Court be ultimately right than consistently wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this Government could not support that sort of taxation simplicity, nor did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several books, including volumes of the  Australian Official War History, Hell and High Fever  and  Itambu  by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, refer to the Japanese atrocities but there is absolutely no reference to the trials and executions of the 34 New Guineans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first batch of trials the sentences were referred to and apparently confirmed by the General Officer Commanding the 1st Australian Army, LieutenantGeneral  Sir Edmund  Herring, later Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Victoria, in his capacity as Administrator of the Australia-New Guinea Administration Unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that he did himself less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> in doing so because every  speaker  on this side of the House gave support in this matter which is more than he can say for all the members on his own side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly I believe, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> John Marshall, in the famous McCulloch v. Maryland case back in 1 8 19 said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I need only quote on that matter from the decision of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these matters it is no good talking about democracy, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and law if in the past a person’s own record is suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would submit to the Committee that it is neither logical nor sensible to claim that the rule of law that is established for the purpose of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and for maintaining the law extends into this area, particularly when the matters quoted by the honourable member for Denison quite clearly demonstrate that this is a general principle, not a universal principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs pointed out: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is clear that the High Court derived logically its conclusion and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs in the politest judicial words said that the result was surprising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the balance of parliamentary <span class="highlight">justice</span> is in favour of what the Government is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, to me, is not elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span>; it is behaviour which is not governed by the law as one sees the law as applying to oneself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are making a political decision and the sum total of my feeling over a month of argument and a month of pressures is that the elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> lies in favour of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found very little to disagree with in the speech of the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Carlton),  who put the matter very much on the question of what was the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reynolds concluded that there was no reason mining should not take place and he laid down very strict guidelines on the methods to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only two of the seven judges on the case-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen- held the view that the territorial sea was within State jurisdiction, but their view was not the majority view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of them,  Sir Garfield  Barwick,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jacobs and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason, clearly took the view that the territorial sea did not form part of the land territory of Australia but that we had the territorial jurisdiction to legislate in respect of the territorial sea, being within our external affairs power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two other members of the High Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, took the view that the territorial sea was attached to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Court found that the charge for the offence under the rules was not determined in accordance with the rules and amounted to a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasoning of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jacobs and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason was that the Commonwealth had power under the external affairs power over the territorial sea because it was external to Aus.tralia that is, it was not within the territorial limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have already pointed out, this is a view shared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relevant section is section 196 which states that if any officer of customs or of police shall have reasonable cause to suspect that any person is unlawfully carrying, or has any goods subject to the control of customs, or any prohibited imports, or any prohibited exports secreted about him, the following consequences shall ensue: Firstly, the officer may detain and search the suspected person; secondly, before the suspected person shall be searched he may require to be taken before a <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the Collector of customs; thirdly, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or collector may order the suspected person to be searched or may discharge him without search but females shall only be searched by a female searcher appointed by the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or collector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I give the following advice to members of the community who find themselves being requested to submit to a search at an airport or shipping terminal: Demand to be taken before a <span class="highlight">justice</span>; and demand in the presence of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> that he require the officer to nominate the source of his reasonable cause for suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole situation calls for the immediate attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  so that the position can be clarified and the right to search given to a customs officer only on proof of reasonable suspicion being shown to the satisfaction of a <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Staples arrived in Vancouver from Australia on 5 July 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has met with legislators, judges, lawyers, police officers, civil rights and race relations workers, and legal aid bodies and has had discussions with officers of the State Department, the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, Depanment of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Contracts Compliance Program, the Women’s Bureau of the U.S. Depanment of Labor, the Library of Congress, and a number of other agencies, and has had discussions with officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, and several other courts, civil and criminal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those are two questions that I raise today in this Parliament, and I think that the Government will need to consider them if common <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is vocal in arguing that the partial adjustment of wages to price increases, is a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask, <span class="highlight">justice</span> for whom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the honourable member for Berowra speaks about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With our present high cost levels it seems to me quite inconsistent to ignore those facts, and to be seeking continually to increase costs in Australia on a basis of humanity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although one can see some <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the comment that the present Government has been in power since 1975 and that it is well into the third calendar year since then, the fact remains that the great harm done to the Australian economy was in fact done from the end of 1972 to the end of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own concern was initially prompted by the appointment late last year of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large on nuclear matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 14 August 1923 Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> W. H. Irvine wrote to the Victorian Government on behalf of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sight of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Elizabeth Evatt on  Monday Conference  some months ago defending aspects of the report of the Royal Commission into Human Relationships brought to mind a further quote from Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Irvine’s letter to the Victorian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Elizabeth Evatt, of course, was a member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when she was appointed  Chairman  of the Royal Commission, but by the time the report was presented she was Chief Judge of the Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not altogether disagree with the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Falconer),  and I suspect that not all my colleagues shared my views about the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as a roving ambassador on the question of uranium safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequently this attitude was reversed and the matter is now before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson,  Deputy President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission where it has been since 12 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue may well then be referred to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or some other international arbitral institution, as being used, for instance, to resolve the dispute between France and the United Kingdom over certain islands in the English Channel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has resulted also in a direct attack for mealy political purposes, for the purpose of grandstanding, upon distinguished persons such as  Sir Edmund  Herring and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the honourable member has done is to claim that there has been some form of cover-up to protect the reputations of persons who during the Second World War were involved in the bringing to <span class="highlight">justice</span> of criminals who were later hanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of the Opposition I commend, as has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  the report of Aboriginal Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, as a landmark determination and a review of a totally new judicial procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I instance that great historical judicial decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who had to determine whether to permit the demolition of the angophora forests in order to mine the $56m worth of wolfram underneath. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made the decision that those angophoras could not really be valued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope led the inquiry into the National Estate, and I am pleased that a man of his calibre is now  chairman  of the Heritage Commission of New South Wales because we need sensitivity, understanding and men of foresight to protect our heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government feels that there is not much <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a system that provides benefits for and expects contributions from nursing home type patients who are in hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s Ambassador-at-Large on nuclear non-proliferation,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, has established an office in London and is maintaining an active monitoring program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with the utmost respect to the honourable member for Robertson, for whom I do have a regard, that he did himself less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> on this occasion because I would have thought it was fundamental, if a State government was not consulted on this matter, one could have executive power at Commonwealth level used without any restraint at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that it does and that is what we object to because this is the sort of situation that could develop at, say, Ranger It might be remembered that the Fox Inquiry was told that mill tailings, which if exposed to the atmosphere give off radon gas for a hundred thousand years, would be stored under water and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said that was no good and they should be buried in the empty mine after the uranium has been taken out, and I understand that will happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I inform the Senate that on the recommendation of the Government,  His Excellency,  the Governor-General has further extended the terms of reference of the Royal Commission inquiring into the electoral redistribution of Queensland in 1977 to allow  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government took this action after advice from me and with the concurrence of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to ensure that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor was able to make findings in the light of the evidence, about the conduct of any person that the Government has taken the action that it has to have the terms of reference of the Royal Commission widened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-34-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable gentleman would know, the Government is concerned to ensure that there is a full and adequate opportunity of inquiring into the circumstances of the whaling industry and has appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Frost as the head of a commission for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should also be within that delegation an opportunity for  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Frost to participate and to consider the nature and character of the International Whaling Commission and the conservation practices for which it was constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the intention of the original Act to protect the existing rights of people who had a prior interest in Aboriginal land, as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his Royal Commission report on Aboriginal Land Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The facts are these:  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, as he now is, was promised the presidency of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission before the 1972 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This promise was made known to  Mr Hawke  who, however, spoke with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore about the matter and finally also spoke to  Mr Whitlam  about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  told me of his talk with  Mr Hawke,  but he also told me, and emphasised the fact, that if I wanted to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, as he then was, to the position of  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, he would get the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He told me that he had no intention whatever of repudiating his promise to me or his promise to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did suggest, however, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s very special knowledge of industrial law- he is an outstanding industrial lawyer- should not be lost to the Commonwealth Industrial Court, and that I ought to try to persuade him to transfer from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to the Industrial <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Court, but to make it clear to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney that, if he still wanted the presidency of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the original offer would still stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney of  Mr Whitlam  ‘s proposition and so did  Dr Ian  Sharp, my permanent head; and he finally agreed to go to the Industrial Court, adding that he had developed a deep respect for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore since he had worked with him as a  Deputy President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and that he also enjoyed a warm friendship with him and would, in these circumstances, be happy to release  Mr Whitlam  and me from the earlier commitments which we had made to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, I am certain that  Mr Carr’s  story did not come from  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that  Sir John  Moore would not- I emphasise would not- have been appointed as  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, when he was appointed, had  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney wanted the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  did not repudiate his promise to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and I did not repudiate mine and neither was I overruled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of public money being spent in the interests of farm leaders, as it is presently spent in the interests of capital, management, labour and trade unions, cannot be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to remove any unfortunate suspicions that might otherwise develop concerning the motives and the decisions reached at those meetings, will the Government now reconsider its decision not to require the seven Ministers who attended those meetings to give evidence before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem, from the media presentation, that the trial of  Dr Yuri  Orlov was certainly not in accord with the standards of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which we are accustomed in this country- standards which we would seek to preserve and which we would hope might be extended into many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That policy was based on the findings and recommendations of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry conducted under the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Presiding Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These principles can be summed up in the following way: The primary aim of disciplinary provisions should be to facilitate efficient administration and public confidence in the integrity of the administration; there should be no unnecessary concern with the private lives of staff members; provisions should be seen as a complement to other management processes of supervision, leadership and staff counselling, with disciplinary action generally being a last resort; the disciplinary process should continue to be essentially administrative rather than judicial, but the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness should be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having examined the record of the honourable gentleman’s political colleagues,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was quite emphatic in stating in his report that the future of Aboriginal land rights certainly did not rest, in terms of political judgments or the so-called compassion of members of the National Country Party, in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In speaking to the amendments moved by the Opposition, I think it is fair enough to say that they are not just a list of amendments suddenly produced out of the air but are amendments, like the Labor Party’s total position in relation to the Aboriginal land trust legislation, which are based upon the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any legislation which confers rights on the Government of the Northern Territory it ought to be noted that in his report at paragraph 740  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward stated:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already pointed out that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward expressed concern about the attitude of the Northern Territory legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present Act, there is no specific provision, as was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, which would expand the rights of Aborigines to enter upon pastoral leases for traditional purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward recommended that Aborigines themselves should control entry to Aboriginal lands- a power traditionally exercised by the Northern Territory Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, in 1971 the Court, under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, ruled against the Yirrkala people and in favour of the Nabalco company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to inquire into the manner in which land rights could be put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, I think that in a mere theoretical approach to this subject one ought to be able to see that a Federal government is more likely to succeed in achieving <span class="highlight">justice</span> for Aborigines for the very reason of our Federal structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Protection of this right was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, whose report we hear quoted on all sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to those honourable members who have made so much of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, on whose report the whole land rights legislation was based, that he was instructed, as the shadow Minister said, to determine how to allocate the land to Aborigines, not whether it should be allocated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s report was about how to grant the lands to Aborigines, not whether it should be or not, and that report was not debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it was remarked by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Waddell that in view of the large sum of $1 10m involved in the Cambridge collapse, the Corporate Affairs Commission should take out proceedings against the directors and auditors of the company for misrepresentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his Second Report were given effect to by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, which was proclaimed on 26 January 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-57-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other measures to give effect to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s recommendations include: the purchase by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission of land for Aboriginals, including several cattle stations; the provision of village areas for communities on pastoral properties; the provision of land in towns for Aboriginal community housing, hostels and camping places; the provision of grants and advice to help Aboriginal groups to make good use of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-57-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A copy of a letter dated 21 April 1978 from the former Minister for Administrative Services to the Attorney-General; a copy of a letter dated 23 April 1978 from the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General to the Prime Minister; a copy of a letter dated 24 April 1978 from the Chief Australian Electoral Officer to the AttorneyGeneral; a copy of a letter dated 11 May 1978 from the Attorney-General to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, a copy of a letter dated 1 1 May 1978 from the Attorney-General to the honourable member for Fadden; and a copy of a letter dated 12 May 1978 from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor to the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Government’s policy throughout this matter, as reflected in  Senator Durack  ‘s letter to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor of 11 May, to have all allegations of illegality or impropriety in the course of the McPherson redistribution fully heard and determined, Cabinet decided on 30 May to have the terms of reference widened again so that the royal commission could make a finding on whether any breach of the law of the Commonwealth or any impropriety had occurred on the part of any person in the course of the McPherson redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor entirely exonerated the Honourable Eric Robinson of allegations concerning the Queensland redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> McGregor thus found that an impropriety had been committed not because of  Senator Withers’  act of communicating with  Mr Pearson  about the name of the electorate but because of ‘the purpose with which he did it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were of the view that we had no option but to accept  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor’s report and accepting it had inevitable consequences in respect of the finding of impropriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that is a very happy arrangement, if one can get <span class="highlight">Justice</span> McGregor to be foolish enough to take the responsibility to expand the terms of reference to net the Minister for Administrative Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Senator Withers also gave a surprising explanation of  Mr Fraser’s  motives in dumping him from the Ministry- an explanation which had nothing to do with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor’s Royal Commission report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was disturbed to hear, and I think I heard it correctly, the Leader of the Opposition make a veiled attack on the credibility and the integrity of the royal commissioner, a distinguished Queen’s Counsel at the Sydney Bar and a distinguished judge, when he suggested that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor could be bought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the actions of the honourable member for Fadden that produced this Royal Commission of Inquiry, not the Prime Minister’s love of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or his desire to see that the truth came out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Attorney-General’s attention been drawn to a statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Holland in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 17 March 1978 that there was a prima facie case of a breach of fiduciary duty by  Mr Vrisakis  both as a partner and as a legal adviser and further by a failure to disclose or draw attention to the fact that he was receiving preferential treatment in a deed of guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-91-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of a Press report in the Australian Financial Review of 20 March 1978 of statements, of the kind referred to, attributed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Holland in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 17 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-91-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a whole range of issues which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was required to look at in that review and to adequately assess his review this Parliament will need information on the extent and location of acts of political violence in this society and the success or otherwise of existing forces and, perhaps, the judicial system in coping with these acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not wish tonight to canvass the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or otherwise of section 26e of the Income Tax Assessment Act except to say that if income is earned by any taxpayer in Australia, whatever its nature, that income or benefit should naturally be covered by the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr Graham)  in drawing to the attention of the House the argument that in <span class="highlight">justice</span> those who actually engaged in war service, those who served in a theatre of war, are entitled to greater consideration in the allocation of finance than those who did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows his answer to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in which he indicated that the letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor led to the expansion of the terms of reference to cover allegations in relation to uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that  Senator Durack  wrote to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor on 1 1 May, after the terms of reference had been expanded, and that the letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, to which the Prime Minister referred, in fact was on 12 May, well after the date on which the terms of reference were expanded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that he assumed was that the letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor led to the expansion of the terms of reference in relation to uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth of the matter is that the course being followed by this Government is the only course which will lead the nation back into a situation where there is equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the average <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> can come only through a situation in which we bring an end to the spiralling costs and bring an end to the ravaging of the economy which has reached the extent where investment is incapable of carrying the needs of the day for expansion, for growth, for productivity and for development which will provide adequate employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Prime Minister had defined in those terms of reference was so restrictive as to guarantee not only that the findings would be limited but also, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor pointed out in his letter of 12 May, that the facts that could be explored would be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor said in that letter of 12 May: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 1 May  Senator Durack,  as Attorney-General, wrote to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those terms of reference were drawn up by the Liberal Party, not on any basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Who will have respect for the Government’s integrity, its <span class="highlight">justice</span>, its impartiality or its honesty if it allows this matter to continue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not an imputation against  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor I do not know what is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been given the facts in relation to the letters written to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor and by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor to the Attorney-General in relation to the broadening of the terms of reference, and the fact that that letter related to various allegations that had been made, in not specific terms but about that time, in relation to uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Government, rather than jettison  Senator Withers  at its own hand, tried then to extend the terms of reference by having  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor do their dirty work for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quick as a flash the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, replied that he would have no part of it, that he would not inquire into any matter which was not set out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the absence of an arbitration clause, a dispute arising in relation to the Agreement would have been subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>- as a result of action taken by Australia during the term of office of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we were in government we had untold trouble in trying to get the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to guarantee that France did something about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That means that a homeless person, a vagrant type of person or someone who appears in court looking like he is not the average citizen has a much poorer chance of getting <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the court system than anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right from the commencement of the latter part of the dispute,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gaudron and Commissioner Clarkson have taken the Government to task for standing over, for deliberately goading, the telecommunications commissioners into action that has been inflammatory and has driven these individuals, concerned as they are about their employment, into taking the action that they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two sides to every dispute, but right from the outset we have had the silence of the Minister and the impetuosity of the Government in forcing penal legislation on to Telecom itself, calling on it to introduce a bans clause, which was rejected by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gaudron, who described it as inflammatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any significance in the fact that the Prime Minister returned to Australia after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor had completed the taking of evidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And while vigorously supporting the right to strike asserts that on any principle of comparative or social <span class="highlight">justice</span> a strike for either extra emoluments or special annual leave in addition to the current average 5 weeks annual leave is unjustified and unfair to the bulk of the Australian work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it turned out to be petrol which ignited and inflamed the situation to such an extent that  Deputy President  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron and Commissioner Clarkson took the Government to task because of its attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Viable productive industries are vitally important to a sound economy and it is against this background that I have urged the Government to examine the value that relief to these industries would be as well as the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of equitably sharing the burden of re-establishing the Australian economy to the advantage of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite frankly, in terms of procedure in the House, the constant assertions by inference of the honourable gentleman and some of his colleagues, as on this occasion, leave no recourse at all to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those things are well worth keeping in mind when one is talking about a government which has relentlessly pursued decency and honesty in government, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness, seeking to impose a departure tax on people who are using essential services which have been provided by the taxpayers through general revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the borrowing program of the present Government is done in accordance with the most orthodox, proper and legal means, and any suggestion that any comparison can be drawn between the activities of some of his former ministerial leaders and what has occurred over the past 18 months is not really doing the honourable member for Adelaide <span class="highlight">justice</span> or credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But let me make a simple reference to the work of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker who, in commenting in his report on the United Kingdom Windscale inquiry, made this observation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Parker went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and moral obligation discharged by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly $ 1,500m would be available in the form of additional revenue to the Government if it proceeded to raise revenue according to a scale of social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> and according to a system of progressive levies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we should be doing is implementing a policy which will enable us to combine the two proposals so that we provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all and ensure that people are not subject to the double jeopardy of taxation and means testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be a decision which is distressing a large number of people, which will be an administrative nightmare and which intrudes into my concept of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need for development projects in Australia which will provide jobs, which will provide incentives and which will provide the large economic cake that can be divided to provide social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He sold out those moderates, those right wingers in the Labor Party, those few genuine Labor men with a commitment to social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, with the weak speech that he gave in this House this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, and this is the most important consideration, is the question of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is denying in every sense the <span class="highlight">justice</span> that is due to these people who leave the educational institutions and who are entitled to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is now a major breakdown in the transfer of people from the educational institutions into the work force and instead of the Government recognising it and dealing with it with <span class="highlight">justice</span>, what does it do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Accordingly, did the Fijian Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> not appeal to Australia ‘to send delegates who are prepared to take decisions within the ambit of the Conference’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, the very necessary principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness should be observed in any new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> the common law normally requires that a product which is bought should meet the purpose for which it is specified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is necessary from my point of view that I establish completely that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to the other parties, that there is no evidence of any tax liability, and that all documents and papers and everything else are completed in the manner in which they should be completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can only stress to the Minister for Veteran’s Affairs that this section of the Act, and the section of the Income Tax Act which covers reparation payments for Nazi war atrocities, should be investigated so that we may achieve some sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these people who fought so nobly and bravely during that period of World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I want to deplore the sectarian challenge of the well-named DOGS- the Council for the Defence of Government Schools- to elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> for independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than letting this failure to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> continue until, as is quite likely, the private sector of education gets into even greater financial difficulties, it seems to me that it would be wiser to give more detailed consideration to what I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have been truly democratic Australian <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and I think the general injustice for those who feel they have to educate their children privately has gone on for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that the matter came before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission today and that about an hour ago he put forward a proposal which would allow a resumption of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand also that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke has proposed that an assessment be made of the situation by experts from the National Roads and Motorists Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are aware of the delicate negotiations which have been conducted today by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke with the objective of getting the truck drivers employed by Caltex Oil at the’ Banksmeadow terminal back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke has made that clear in his statement today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already today the Minister for Industrial Relations indicated the details of the recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke that the men should begin work at 6.30 a.m. tomorrow and that he will be on site at the Broadmeadow terminal at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow with inspectors from the National Roads and Motorists Association to inspect car damage, which is the basis of the dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke will be on site at 9.30 a.m. and he hopes there will be a return to work at 6.30 a.m. We on this side of the House believe that given some good will on both sides this dispute can be settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I took the trouble to speak to some people in the Transport Workers Union today and I understand that despite company promises, as ruled by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Ludeke, that the senior officials would negotiate with the unions this week, such negotiations did not in fact occur and that actually the company reneged on that arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned on another matter that the honourable member for Grey has raised tonight, which is that the Government has found a new dodge to escape from the people’s cry for <span class="highlight">justice</span> with regard to the provision of television and proper telephone services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am staggered that the Labor Party is opposing what, on the face of it, is a very fine move in the question of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> which will give legal aid to people who at present have been denied it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was quite right when he said that some time ago that was not the situation but as a result of the progressive social <span class="highlight">justice</span> reform of this Government in these new guidelines, that situation is now altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why Lionel Murphy, now  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, a judge of the High Court of Australia, introduced this set-up when he was Attorney-General- it was opposed by the conservatives and Tories who sat opposite us- was that he knew as well as we in the Labor Party knew that there were people in our community who were being denied <span class="highlight">justice</span> because they had no shekels in their pockets just as there were people in our community who were being denied health care because they could not afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to prevail, access to people who are able to give advice, not judgment, ought to be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think everybody- that is, everybody except the honourable member for Denison- knows that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect to other matters falling within the estimates of the Attorney-General’s Department, I wish to draw attention to several matters affecting the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> at the federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No contribution to a debate on the AttorneyGeneral’s Department would be complete without a favourable reference being made to the Law Reform Commission and to its  chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In the same report he said that he had been corresponding with the Attorney-General’s Department for a number of years about the general decline of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory but that no meeting had taken place between himself and the Attorney-General’s Senior Private Secretary even to discuss the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Clearly, the Attorney-General is out of touch and is out on a limb in his view that  Mr Kilduff  is exaggerating the poor state of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that it has received that support means that it needs to be very careful indeed not to step over into the area of proselytising or arguing its case and it needs to interpret very carefully what the term ‘the modernisation of the law, the testing of current opinion as to what is equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in particular cases’, means to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission Report of 1974 indicated that he could see no reason why areas should not be both owned as Aboriginal Land and declared as national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  St John ruled that any decision to stand down employees without pay was outside the award that governed Telecom employees but within the Telecommunications Act, can the Minister inform the House whether he considers any action should be taken to resolve the confusion which now exists in the minds of Telecom employees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do know that during the concluding stages of the Telecom dispute <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decided that stand-down without pay was valid where people put bans on work which was at their normal place of work and which they were normally required to do, but that if they were required to move away from their normal place of work to somewhere else and therefore to do work which they were not normally required to do they should not be stood down without pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that if the New South Wales Government had concern for integrity in relation to this matter, as a result of the interference of the Leader of the Opposition it would say that the matter cannot be heard properly and fairly and with <span class="highlight">justice</span> and would therefore cease the inquiry if it were concerned for <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was known and it is still known that the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be subverted, that the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be destroyed, by improper debate in a parliament about a matter that is before a court upon whose judgment the future and faith of individuals or of the people can depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I claimed over there in Jamaica at the Commonwealth Conference last September, that Australians wanted to see racism not only eliminated in South Africa and Rhodesia but eliminated from the face of the earth so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> might flow down like a mountain stream until the injustice that has existed too long is over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statements made about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and the eminent position to which he has been appointed as a roving ambassador on these general problems on behalf of the Austraiian Government, would lend support to that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  has explained,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, who is the  Chairman  of the Remuneration Tribunal and the Academic Salaries Tribunal has now been elected chancellor of the University of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words the  Chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, was a common denominator on both tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, if protection can be justified on social grounds clearly, on the basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, it should be provided through a bounty rather than a tariff or a quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is deemed in Australia’s national interest that such protection should be afforded to a particular industry, on the basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, a bounty is the appropriate mechanism for providing such assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would welcome the move because I believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only has to be done but also has to be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> are there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-2-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They bind us all in everything we do in this world, whether we like it or not, and the whole body of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> must revolt against this proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-2-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as fundamental to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> as anything else that I can conceive that evidence which has not been cross-examined is not worth very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-2-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our people have not trudged across the centuries to build up <span class="highlight">justice</span> for simple-minded people, malevolently minded people such as the honourable member to wash those efforts away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-2-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to (3) As the honourable member would know, this Government adheres to the policy established by the then Prime Minister  Mr Chifley  in 1949, followed by successive Governments since that time, and endorsed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope at paragraph 781 of the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, namely that neither details of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization nor its operations are disclosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-56-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would, however, draw the honourable member’s attention to the comments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on this general topic contained in paragraphs 195 to 199, and 464 to 467 of the first volume of the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-56-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Public servants exercising discretionary powers are, of course, bound to exercise those powers in accordance with any applicable statutory and common law rules, including principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The desirability of separately identifying Aboriginals in criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> statistics has been raised by the AttorneyGeneral with State Attorneys-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, is a major reason for this escalation changes in design which have been initiated by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What alterations in design have been recommended by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and what is the estimated additional cost for each of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the procedure followed when the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s recommendations are made, (a) to whom are they made, (b) are they subject to independent evaluation and, if so, by whom and (c) who authorises the alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of the design has called for the closest collaboration between the architects, the builder, the National Capital Development Commission and the user, represented principally by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Attorney-General’s Department A great deal of reliance has been placed on the user in relation to the functional requirements for the High Court, and in this respect the contribution and continuing interest of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has been of outstanding value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, I refer to the criticism of the Minister by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aiken at page 78 of that judgment, where he dealt with an affidavit of the Minister in which the Minister referred to meetings of the Australian Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the foreign affairs sections it says that the Labor Party would: give firm and unwavering support to the United Nations and its agencies and to the United Nations Charter, and make every effort to secure the United Nations as an effective instrument for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and peace and political, social and economic advancement; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer now to evidence given by Professor Carey to the royal commission into urban transport conducted by  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Neasey, one of the finest judges not just in Tasmania but in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment was described in the legislation committee as a natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> provision, and I am in sympathy with the thought that lay behind it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst embracing the attitude adopted by the two honourable members, namely, that we want to give everybody the opportunity to be treated with complete fairness and complete <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it just would not be administratively possible to allow what could be a tremendous number of people, who may believe, and may believe wrongly, that the implied criticism was directed at them, to make individual representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The surcharge provisions were the only measure by which some retribution- if you like to call it that- or <span class="highlight">justice</span> could be meted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another case about which the peak public service unions would be very concerned if there were any thought that a type of rough <span class="highlight">justice</span> were handed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the Minister that, in the early stages of the application of these provisions, a certain amount of discretion be used so that a type of rough <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not handed out and so that unnecessary friction can be minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to that I sought legal advice from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares who is the legal adviser to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear from the other side a great deal about the Whitlam Government, but we do not hear about the successive governments in the postwar period which, in fact, created the situation where it was necessary for a government, in any sense of fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the pensioners of this country, to award the kinds of massive increases that occurred during Labor’s terms in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that rubbish about Labor getting the country into hock, the single-minded obsession of the Prime Minister with depressing wages and endeavouring to reduce inflation at whatever the cost, the huge transfers involved to enable strong industries to make higher and higher profits while displacing workers, the millions going over to mining companies that have reduced employment while increasing thenprofits, the elimination of every vestige of wealth taxes, and here we are still in hock, and we find that the pensioners of this country cannot even get the kind of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that they were promised and repromised over a period of three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will know once and for all whether the Fraser Government is prepared to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to pensioners with the restoration of twice annual adjustments to pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there was a possibility of one point of conflict as a result of the Heritage Commission Act involving matters that had been the subject of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s environmental reports and it does not seem to make much sense to have the possibility of conflict of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise the need for clear and consistent wages policy guidelines, but they must be guidelines which are based upon a sense of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and that is what we do not get from the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only do this by providing equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people living in all areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then of course there was the attack on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because it dared to give some semblance of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in regard to the national wage case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know full well the problems of the back bench and of people such as the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  having to speak out in a sense of honesty and <span class="highlight">justice</span> about what their electorates feel and about what the Press and the media understand and have been telling the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The desirability of reviewing the existing law relating to offences at sea was referred to by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in 1974 in the case of The Queen v.

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams put the proposal to the New South Wales Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, which also supported it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams wrote to me outlining the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams is to be congratulated for his initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dispute is scheduled to go before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Coldham tomorrow morning in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any magistrate, any <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, upon hearing the honourable member for Batman  (Mr Howe)  would ask at the end of the honourable member’s diatribe: ‘What is your allegation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a minority judgment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is generally accepted throughout the legal profession and in the Taxation Office itself that this minority judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy is an outstanding judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy goes on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy concludes: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be remembered that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> practised as a leader of the Sydney Bar and, beyond question, built up a reputation for giving final approval to tax dodging schemes submitted by solicitors - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision laid down principles which the Australian High Court followed for many years until the current Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> presided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not class tax avoidance in the eyes of the learned <span class="highlight">justice</span> as something that should be frowned upon, nor does it suggest that the person who does avoid tax should be frowned upon for making someone else carry his burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The learned <span class="highlight">justice</span> called it an ingenious trick, and said, however unappreciative his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to inform the House, moreover, that the grand jury inquiry into the uranium marketing arrangements has been concluded and that no proceedings by the United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department have been instituted against any Australian company in consequence of that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That allowed for a period during which the heads of agreement on which the consultations took place could be considered in detail by the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and other United States departments involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of an independent tribunal, combining the functions of both of the current repatriation tribunals was proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I also emphasise that the essential principles of the repatriation appeals system- those that have protected appellants and conferred upon them rights to ensure that every opportunity is given to them to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span>- are being retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After his savings were defrauded in the H. G. Palmer crash on the recommendation of the MLC, he went to court to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New South Wales Attorney-General,  Mr Walker,  is the only person who has advised investors in ASL- of which many were employees of  Sir Reginald  Ansett who advised his employees to invest in ASLthat they should seek legal advice with a view to getting legal <span class="highlight">justice</span> as Clive Evatt did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of the need for <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be manifestly seen to be done when the Government is both the prosecution and the funder of the defence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Rae Committee also referred to a comment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, when dealing with a firm known as John T. Martin and Co. Talking about its deficiencies, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discretion of a court to set aside a property settlement order will be exerciseable where there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> arising from circumstances other than those now specified by the Act, such as fraud or false evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister for Health appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke to conduct an inquiry into medical fees and decided that the proceedings will be held in private? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, who happens to be a  Deputy President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, has been engaged to conduct the inquiry and he will make his determination public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In keeping with the Government’s commitment to civil rights and administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also explain the position taken by the Government in this legislation in relation to withholding passports from persons generally known as ‘white collar criminals’ who are suspected of attempting to escape from <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might extend <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity to 100,000 people but will leave 8,000 or 10,000 out in the cold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a previous occasion I have met with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and the Secretary of the Department,  Mr Kingsland,  in regard to the proposal by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that there ought to be legal representation at the appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose put it, it seems wrong that an ex-serviceman can use a deregistered barrister with all his ability- as well as the disability which led to his deregistration- to appear for him whilst he cannot use a registered barrister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware that this happens, but it is an extreme position put by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of an independent tribunal combining the functions of both the previous War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals and the assessment appeal tribunals was proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his independent inquiry into the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose did recommend that section 47 of the Act be amended or abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what did the Government do about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose ‘s recommendations on statutory bodies for determination of claims? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose made a suggestion about legal representation, but when we referred that to the veterans’ organisations, especially the RSL and the Australian Veterans Defence Services Council, they were very much opposed to that type of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had a look at this matter and honourable members will remember that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his report suggested this means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of looking at the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and from talking to the organisations we feel that this is a way that ought to provide a framework for a better system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, on matters of a law, for instance, there has been no satisfactory recourse for anybody who feels that he has not received <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done something along the lines suggested by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the rule is not inconsistent with the principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> generally recognised by states that have reasonably developed legal systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of that moral concern has been present among those advocating extraterritorial extension of anti-trust legislation- at least among the lawyers and in the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department, if not at Westinghouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  E. S. Williams, fully supported the Government in this approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those in this House, from whichever side we come, who disagree with us on these judgments are seen very often to be in league with those enemies of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we pride ourselves as much as we so often tend to do on our <span class="highlight">justice</span> and humanity as one of the fair nations of this world, let us remember that there is no nation that does not have some blood on its hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to argue the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or otherwise of it; I simply point out that as a result of that conflict Vietnam, at the end of the war, was a devastated country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Gellibrand or the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  believed in the fairness of the tax system for the ordinary wage earner- that 90 per cent of the Australian community who pay 3 3 tec in the dollar taxation- they would realise the equity, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the responsibility of tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is then the failure to appoint a permanent  chairman  until last week or the week before last following the resignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appointment of  Mr Colin  Conron came 16 months after the resignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting aside the fact that petrol is going to be a precious commodity and the talk of conservation, the PJT, under the careful scrutiny of the Minister, will look into the oil industry and make absolutely certain that the oil company giants will be called to <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the first time and that the motorists and the consumers of petrol in Australia will be given a fair and just go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt we will hear the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  very shortly putting once again a case for a rigid price control mechanism and he will say that this is <span class="highlight">justice</span> because of the need for indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Family Court in Western Australia is operating very successfully, due very much to the efforts of its Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Barblett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was the expressed, and publicly expressed, view of  Sir Owen  Dixon, Australia’s greatest Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, that the High Court of Australia should travel into every State of Australia and should be accessible to the citizens of Australia whether they live in Hobart, Rockhampton, Brisbane or Bunbury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the question of whether we should have a single system of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country; in other words, whether we should have a single system whereby, for example, all courts were Federal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say that the argument has been canvassed by many distinguished and eminent jurists and lawyers and for my own part I prefer the view which has been expressed publicly on this question by  Sir Laurence  Street, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, like  Sir Laurence  Street, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, I enter the debate to issue a word of caution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only recently the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, completely reversed his decision on territorial representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new provisions will allow the setting aside of maintenance agreements whenever there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is one that is well known in law and one that allows much greater flexibility than the narrow concept at present in the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Davidson’s case in 1969  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt ruled as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Menhennitt judgment is a decision of a single <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Victorian Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of R. v. Davidson in the Supreme Court of Victoria,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt held that a doctor  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the New South Wales case of R. v. Wald and others in 1971,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Levine, in applying the Menhennitt rule, held that it would be for the jury to decide whether there existed in each case any economic, social or medical grounds or reason which, in its view, constituted reasonable grounds upon which a doctor could honestly and reasonably believe there would result a serious danger to her physical or mental health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Counsel have been briefed to advise on the current validity of the principles of judicial reasoning and decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt in R. v. Davidson ( 1969) V. R. 667 in which  His  Honour ruled on the circumstances which constituted the ‘unlawful’ use of an instrument to procure a miscarriage, an offence pursuant to Section 65 of the Crimes Act, 1958 (Victoria). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt inter alia, dealt with the element of unlawfullness in the charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With great respect to  His  Honour he suffered from a great lack of binding authority, he did not re-examine the reasoning of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt in R. v. Davidson but uncritically applied the persuasive decision of a Superior Court in Victoria, albeit one based on the repeatedly discredited principle of ‘necessity’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of his judgment,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Anderson said, at p. 539,: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Harris also commented on the defence of necessity in the above case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt made no reference to the leading authority of R. v. Dudley &amp; Stephens and either did not apply his mind to, or dismissed as irrelevant, the elements of unavoidability and immediacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In summary it is our opinion that the legal reasoning of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt, relying on the principle of necessity, as a defence to a criminal charge in R. v. Davidson would not be confirmed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>given by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt in R. v. Davidson is wrong and would not be approved by a Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our further opinion based on the reasons for judgment in the appellate decisions of the Victorian Full Court in Wood v. Rama and R. v. Dawson that the definition of unlawfully’ in section 65 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) given by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt in R. v. Davidson is wrong and would not be approved by a Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The name of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt has been mentioned already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will see that the first phrase that is used in the definition by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt is ‘necessary to preserve a woman from serious danger’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, I stood firmly on the decisions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt and Judge Levine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proper way to go about correcting this is to ensure that the Liberal Government in Victoria and the Labor Government in New South Wales administer the law according to the decisions of either  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt or Judge Levine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us hope that we can decide to act in this House today with compassion and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, certainly for the unborn, but also for the unfortunate women and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no way that 60,000 abortions each year could be described as being within the rulings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt and Judge Levine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Out of that came  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Levine’s interpretation of the existing abortion law in Sydney which has been referred to on many occasions in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Normally accepted precepts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would require such people empirically to prove their case beyond all reasonable doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned that an attack has been made on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt himself on a number of occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me as a former Victorian parliamentarian and a current member of the legal profession in Victoria say this: No judge in the Supreme Court of Victoria has a higher reputation amongst members of the Bar or members of the legal profession than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore the attacks upon the integrity of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it interesting that for many years after that judgment and its implications were known, at no stage in the Victorian Parliament were  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt or that judgment attacked by any member from any party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attack has had to come from the Commonwealth Parliament and we have had to drag in a legal opinion from a couple of barristers in New South Wales, who have no knowledge of the Victorian jurisdiction or of the reputation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt, to try to destroy the efficacy of that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if there is any suggestion- I am sure it would not come from the honourable member- that in case the visit was seen as provocative the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and I should not go to the site, then that is just not on, any more than it is on that I cease to use Commonwealth car No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In keeping with the Government’s commitment to civil rights and administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of Ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reaching a balance in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, protection and equity, one needs a high degree of specialised knowledge of the complexities of this area, and I suggest that that speciality is not the exclusive preserve of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was all that was intended by the honourable member for Macquarie and it is sad reflection on the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> himself that he could not see the wood for the trees and that he proceeded with all due dispatch and reckless haste to place a dark and sinister interpretation on the actions of the honourable member as instanced by his use of the words ‘grave impropriety’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst I have much respect for you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I find it extraordinary that an attack of this nature is permitted upon the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, a person whom nobody here could claim has loyalty to the Australian Labor Party or anything of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are that tonight a member of the New South Wales Bar came into this Parliament to attack the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, that is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore said in granting a full flow-on at the last case which was the first six-monthly hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill makes provision for payments in lieu of long leave not taken upon the death in office or the retirement of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that payments to High Court justices such as those dealt with in this Bill should not depend upon the exercise of executive discretion but on legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appropriate, however, that the provisions for justices of the High Court be made in a separate Bill because of the special position occupied by that Court which is the court established under the Constitution whereas other federal courts are created by the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the payment on the retirement of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> who has completed not less than 10 years’ service, or on the death of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> irrespective whether he has completed 10 years’ service, of an amount calculated at the rate of 5.2 weeks for each completed year of qualifying judicial service or an amount equivalent to one year’s salary whichever is the lesser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If after ten years a <span class="highlight">justice</span> retires or dies in office without having taken any long leave, he, his widow or dependants, as the case may be, shall be paid a sum equal to the amount of one year’s salary as at the date of his retirement or death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If on the other hand a <span class="highlight">justice</span> should die in office before he completes 10 years’ service an amount is payable calculated on the basis of 5.2 weeks for each year of his service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a <span class="highlight">justice</span> retires the payment is, of course, to be made to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer honourable members to the report of the Royal Commission into Matters Relating to Norfolk Island, headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is quite unequivocal that we ought to take up in some form or other the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo that the islanders ought to be represented in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When he went to the highest court in Pakistan, the situation was that of a bench of seven, which originally was nine, three judges were for acquittal, three were for conviction, and the casting vote of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> went for conviction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to men such as  Mr Beach,  who is now a Supreme Court Judge, Judge Frederico and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time available to me I want simply to reiterate the facts, not as alleged by me but as found by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans find? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Sir, it was not open to or possible for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans to indict the Cabinet as such because that was outside his terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the specific case that I mentioned, that of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Beach, he waited longer for appointment than any other commissioner or royal commissioner in modern history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They talk about human dignity, freedom, <span class="highlight">justice</span>, peace and all the other essentials which constitute what humanity is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, sued General Motors as well as all the other automobile makers in the late sixties for a conspiracy existing since 1953 to preclude and prevent the development of any pollution control equipment for automobiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the case was finally settled by a consent decree which, in effect, admitted the factual allegations brought by the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has powers and duties in respect of the maintenance of law and order and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Norfolk Island should be thereby separated from the said Colony of Van Diemen ‘s Land (now called Tasmania) and that from that date all power, authority, and jurisdiction of the Governor, Legislature, Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and Magistrates of Tasmania over Norfolk Island should cease and determine, and that from the said date Norfolk Island should be a distinct and separate Settlement, the affairs of which should until further Order in that behalf by Her Majesty be administered by a Governor to be for that purpose appointed by Her Majesty with the advice and consent of Her Privy Council: and it was thereby further ordered that the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New South Wales should be, and he thereby was, constituted Governor of Norfolk Island, with the powers and authorities in the said Order mentioned: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments in part insert a provision which is intended to ensure proper provisions relating to the granting of pardons, remissions of penalties and the like so that the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system can operate adequately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley said, when the claims came before him, that clearly the campaign to which the honourable member referred was outside the guidelines and in breach of the paid rates award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working party was assisted in its review by specialist reports from the Federal Co-ordinating Committee on the management aspects of the new arrangements and from  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson on the operation of the port conciliator service established under the new arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review reports concluded that, generally speaking, the new arrangements have contributed to better performance in the stevedoring industry and that they have gone a long way towards meeting those difficulties identified by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop as far back as February 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there has been some disputation and argument between the Waterside Workers Federation and other unions which come into contact with it in relation to work that is done in or around the stevedoring industry, the extension of the conciliation procedures as set up by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson may be of some assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, as has been reported by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson, too early to say how successful this system will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Withers  was held responsible for the change of name in the Queensland redistribution, we know from the evidence produced at the Royal Commission conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor that it was  Mr Nicholls  who telephoned  Mr Coleman  and suggested that the name be changed in order to prevent embarrassment for the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Minister reconcile this statement of principle with the breakdown of the public participation process at the recent Sydney licence hearings, the expulsion of public witnesses from the hearings by Commonwealth Police, and the resignation of a member of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Janet Strickland, after stating that the hearings were a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It included a Supreme Court <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, a chartered accountant, an economics professor, an official of the Victorian Treasury, a grazier and, of course, the Labor politician the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  mentioned, the revered Ben Chifley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must ask why this legislation has been introduced at this particular time; that is before the Royal Commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams makes its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  E. S. Williams, fully supported the Government in this approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no mention in the second reading speech of the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams as to this particular legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when the royal commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams brings down its report, it will make positive recommendations about how best drug offenders who are also drug addicts, or even simply drug users, should be treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments that we will be proposing at the Committee stage will provide that warrants for electronic surveillance equipment may be issued only by a judge with the status of a Supreme Court <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or Federal Court <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These increased penalties are essential, not only from the point of view of retributive <span class="highlight">justice</span>- acknowledging the tremendous destruction and ultimate death caused to young people who get hooked on the products of this trade- but also as a deterrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I draw the attention of the Parliament to a statement made in the Criminal Court in Brisbane by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stable on 28 March 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stable saw fit in his position of responsibility to draw to our attention the problem as the judiciary sees it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third part of the legislation deals with the property of people who have engaged in drug trafficking; people who, in an endeavour to defeat <span class="highlight">justice</span>, in an act of defiance of the laws of the country, have sent their money to other countries or put it into real estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will name one judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, who is not going to get any benefit under this Bill because of that provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in relation to the High Court of Australia, as I think the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition will be pleased to confirm, is that there have been times when, because of the illness of a judge or for some other pressing reason, it has not been possible for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court to release judges to take their long service leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with as much force as I can muster that to suggest in any way, shape or form that the Government’s approach to this legislation has been affected by anything  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor has or has not done in recent times is a proposition which I would reject categorically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition did not go on to say, as one might have thought that he would, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor will not get these benefits because of things he put in the report of his royal commission, the people he criticised or the actions that followed the release of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know personally  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor or the Family Law Court judge affected but I do not know that whatever is decided today about this Bill will not necessarily be the final word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken the way out which will not not have much appeal to those citizens in Australian society who believe that there has to be a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our community, that economic sacrifice ought to begin at the highest levels of our community, and not at the bottom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This speech is made in what I believe to be a climate of general acceptance by the community that legal expenses can be so devastating for the individual that in some instances governments must play a role in absorbing some or all of the impact to ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span> is within reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The salary and allowances of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> amount to some $63,717 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a royal commission situation-  Mr Deputy Speaker,  this point is relevant because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor is one judge who has been mentioned in this debate- or in the case of a government inquiry where legal representation is allowed, to pay more than would normally be allowed by the Supreme Court of a State or the High Court, on a party and party basis, is an unforgivable waste of the taxpayers’ money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued also that when government agrees to pay outrageous fees without question it is becoming a pace setter in relation to legal fees and hence it is placing <span class="highlight">justice</span> even further beyond the reach of  Mr and Mrs Average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done; it must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it is positive proof of the proposition that, if we are serious about the employment of Australian workers, it does not behove the purchaser of a particular utensil or piece of machinery to keep those workers in their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proceedings will be broadcast on Thursday and those taking an interest in this matter can tune in and see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not only done, but is seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(a) The decision as to whether an inquest is to be held is not a matter for my Depanment but solely the concern of the State Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who, after he has received representations by the claimant’s solicitors or other advice, has the power to make an application to the Supreme Court for an order that an inquest be held pursuant to section 37 of the Coroners Act (NSW) 1960 (as amended). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On such application by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Supreme Court may order that an inquest be held, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is based on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues in their opening remarks had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been given no explanation why the Government has departed from the recommendations of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and the members of his Inquiry, who joined with him in the production of that very excellent document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no counterargument to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said in that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not the only ones saying that;  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has said that in those clear, unequivocal, unambiguous terms and no honourable member from the Government’s side has said why the Government has disregarded  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have read the article and have had discussions with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, delivered on 20 April 1979 in a matter involving Australia Post and a dispute over postal drivers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is relevant to this debate because the so-called no work, no pay’ direction was applied in a matter involving Australia Post and the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists which has been before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples on a number of occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples spelt out clearly and unequivocably that the Postal Commission acted in an irresponsible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask also that <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done to those paying excess taxation since the year ended 30 June 1978 by making any favourable decision retrospective to 1 July 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would remind those who will make the decision in this matter that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable members opposite, many of whom have had successful business careers and many of whom when faced with questions of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and injustice fall on the side of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that they should take away and examine very thoroughly this legislation to see what it really means to the people involved in terms of dollars and cents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In early 1973  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was appointed to examine the land situation of the Aboriginal people of Australia and to make a recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note, for example, that the Government has extended the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-large for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Safeguards Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is on record in a paper published in November 1978 by the International Consultative Group on Nuclear Energy as proposing quite new approaches to the avoidance of nuclear proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope after a thorough and searching examination of the needs of the nation for a security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation was foreshadowed in the statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the House on 25 October 1977 when he outlined in broad terms the Government’s decisions to implement reforms affecting the intelligence security agencies recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, there have been substantial changes to ASIO since the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward on 9 March 1976 and particularly since the recommendations of the royal commission were accepted in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has instituted a rigorous system of internal checks to ensure that the Organization’s intelligence collection is geared as closely as possible to the assessed national security priorities and therefore that resources are most efficiently deployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can report to Parliament that this new system, recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, has brought substantial improvements to the overall management of the intelligence community and has prompted a range of on-going reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope pointed out that the justification for the existence of a security organization in a democratic country should be reflected in its charter and, in particular, its functions as set out in that charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of clause 20 requiring the Director-General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the work of the Organization is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions and that the Organization is kept free from any influences not relevant to its functions, follow closely the significant recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, in accordance with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendation, the provisions of the Bill relating to the Director-General, particularly as regards tenure of office and the grounds on which his appointment may be terminated, have been brought in line with provisions dealing with statutory office holders in other Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statutory procedures for notification of security assessments and for rights of appeal in large part implement the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope concluded that legal doubts as to the nature of this relationship that had arisen under the terms of the present Act should be removed and the relationship should be clearly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, Australia is indeed fortunate in having an outstanding Director-General and I am sure that members of all parties share that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that it would be abundantly clear to the Committee that, in a situation of excessive numbers, if an individual staff member is affected by an appeal brought by another staff member natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires that the staff member affected should have the right of audience before the appeal tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers tore to smithereens the Industrial Relations Bureau area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill denies fundamentals of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an abuse of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House were to go into recess without a lengthy debate on that very important paper, it would be a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of that Committee was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imposition of additional tax in similar circumstances was recently discussed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith of the Supreme Court of Western <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith held that the Commissioner was incorrect in imposing additional tax under section 226 on the facts of the case before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I said in a statement released last week, we ought to draw comparison with the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> meted out to some Australians in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our utmost sympathy goes out to them, not in charity but in <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those who have adopted a cult of idleness and the proposition that society owes them a debt will be brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Federal Court of Australia on 9 May 1979,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers struck down one of the most important sections of the Government’s Conciliation and Arbitration Act proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers said that that could not possibly work and that the balance of probabilities was never there in the way the Act was drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where can we find conciliation and arbitration in the present statute which has been nullified by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, on the weekend following that statement the matter was settled in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government’s industrial relations policy depends upon bludgeoning unions and workers into submission rather than relying upon compromise and the establishment of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the industrial area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great advantage of the Opposition’s proposal was that it removed the need in emergency situations for face to face contact between the judge and the person seeking the warrant while still providing for the necessary documentation to ensure with certainty that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to have it made beyond doubt by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  that it would be unusual or extraordinary for a <span class="highlight">justice</span> to permit a listening device in the office of a solicitor who was acting for a client providing that in all cases he was not a participant in the commercial narcotic operations taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would satisfy me in relation to proposed section 5a if the Minister could say that a judge or a <span class="highlight">justice</span> is there who is a judicial man belonging to a supreme or federal court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to inhibit the ability of Customs officers or police forces to gather information so that they can bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> those people who are in breach of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian ministers, particularly the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  and the Minister for Special Trade Representations, in addition to the  Deputy  Prime Minister and myself, pointed repeatedly to the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Australian case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a police officer gave a Crown witness advice or attempted to give advice, no matter how sad and how sadistic the crime was, he could be pulled up for conspiring to pervert the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, frankly, too strong for our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> because they contain two provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Leader of the Opposition failed both in his presentation, as he did in his performance in this chamber as Treasurer, and in recognising the real balance of economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 22 May, the  Deputy  Leader commented on the appointment to the High Court of Australia of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While not in any way detracting from the legal eminence of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson, the simple fact is that his appointment was made by the Court Government, rather than the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later stage in the Press statement he went on to say:  the main reason for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson’s appointment is that his conservative views, particularly on constitutional questions, are well known to, and appreciated by  Sir Charles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that is not only an insult to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson, it is also an insult to the smaller States in the Australian Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson has been acclaimed by legal authorities as a judicial event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court building will cost $45m because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Barwick, to whom this Government owes a great favour, has asked for certain extensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Barwick helped this Government get into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that the previous Coal Industry Tribunal,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher, served as a judge of the New South Wales Industrial Commission from 1955 to 1957 and for many years from 1957 as a  deputy president  of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions enabling  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher’s dual appointments were in the Coal Industry Act 1955 and the Coal Industry Act 1957 but those provisions referred specifically to Francis Heath Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should such an appointment be made, the Tribunal would be required to give priority to coal industry matters, as was the case with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a logical, sensible argument in terms of taxation, equity and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if I can put it that way, for the Government taking up a fair share of its burden and not trying to pass it on to the industry just because the industry is now going through a period of relative affluence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Ludeke- will be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lacks any real sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, who was appointed in 1977 by the Government to head a federal inquiry into drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We call on the Government to give  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams these new terms of reference so that this matter can be resolved to the satisfaction of the Australian community and the international drug law enforcement community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the remarks made by the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Bonython about the proposed royal commission or extending the precise terms given to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams are unnecessary complications in a situation where we have to establish a group consisting of police officers who can ferret out the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information that they obtain will be given to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that in late 1977 the royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, was appointed to examine the drug problem and that was in conjunction with, I think, four States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to remove doubts that have arisen as to whether, as a matter of law, the provisions made by section 3 of the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1977 in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s service and salary while performing the functions of AmbassadoratLarge apply to his service under extensions of the original term of his appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s term of appointment was extended from the original period of 12 months for a period of a little more than two months in October 1978 and for a period of some further five months in January 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now proposed, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has agreed, that his term be further extended from 8 June, when his present extension will expire, until the end of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The doubts that have arisen are legal, technical matters and the Government feels that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s rights should not be left in any doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the 1977 Bill was before the Parliament the Government indicated that the time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox would be engaged on his work as Ambassador-at-Large would be at least 12 months, but might well be longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience has proved this forecast to be correct and it has already been found desirable to extend  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox ‘s appointment beyond the initial period of 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work on which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been engaged as Ambassador-at-Large for nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards is, in the view of the Government, work of great national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late last year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox led the Australian delegation to the mid-term plenary conference of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will be able to make his own special contribution to policy in all these fields and will be an invaluable adviser to the Government on nuclear matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that this Bill proposes to rectify some possible deficiencies in the provision of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox as Ambassador-at-large the Opposition has no objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I should say in relation to that is that the Opposition has considerable respect for the professional integrity and competence of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, it was the Australian Labor Party when in government which appointed <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox to head the inquiry into uranium mining and export- generally the nuclear power industryand I believe his report was one of the more significant contributions towards the information of the public mind on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the duration of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second concerns the almost total dearth of information in relation to the cost associated with <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox’s appointment and the discharge of his duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the first matter, that is, the duration of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox’s appointment, it is important to note that already his appointment has been extended on three occasions- from October 1978 to January 1979, from January 1979 to June 1979 and now it is being further extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would prefer that any further extensions of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox should be the subject matter of Bills before the Parliament as has been the practice in the past so that proper debate can take place in relation to this very important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much does it cost to support <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, his supporting staff and, I believe, his spouse, as he moves around the world as Ambassador-at-large- the man, as some have said, with the gold-plated airline ticket? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on three substantial grounds the Opposition is concerned about the conditions of appointment and operation of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the costs involved in supporting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, his staff and his spouse as they fulfil their functions and move around the world in a style which, I would suggest, is far from austere and much more sufficient in the creature comforts provided than are available generally to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is it correct, as we and a great many people in the community believe, that the Government has unfairly set up <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox as a sort of jet-setting front man to reassure a trusting public while the Government ignores the fundamental propositions he brings forward? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox’s paper on international involvement in the regulation of the nuclear fuel cycle and the nuclear energy industry is, in my view, a seminal work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the evidence available is that the Government has totally ignored what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox has been doing and has encouraged him to move about fulfilling functions which it has defined but in which it is not the least bit interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that first ground, the matter of the duration of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, we will be moving appropriate amendments in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that he started by praising  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, who was appointed to the bench by the Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member and a senior Minister, he then referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as the man with the gold-plated airline ticket, the jet-setting front man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those denigratory remarks can be regarded only as an attack upon  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and an endeavour to reduce the influence and authority of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox when he represents this country around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he knows so little about what is going on in this Parliament that he appeared to be completely unaware that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,  (Senator Button)  has a question on the Question Paper relating to the cost of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if the Opposition is so concerned about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and if what the Leader of the Opposition has said tonight has any truth and substance in it, why was it that it was not raised until one week ago and then not in this House but in another place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I cannot speak to the details on it, I can at least point out that if this amendment were to be agreed to, it would have the effect of fettering the continuing operations of  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, as Australia’s Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  has indicated that the Opposition has no objection in principle to the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, on the very important question of an examination of the processes of nuclear industry, we do not believe that the question of the extension of his appointment ought just simply to be an exercise to be taken by the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that any extension of that appointment ought to come back to the Parliament so that the Parliament itself will have an opportunity to review the work, the activities and the achievements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say this: At a time when this Government is talking about cutbacks, and talking about economic stringencies, and is calling upon other sections of the Australian community to make sacrifices, it is not good enough for the Government to say that it will simply give a mandate to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, whatever his excellence and whatever his capacity, to operate at large and that the question of his reappointment for an indeterminate term will be a matter solely and exclusively for the Executive and not for the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the failures in the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox- and I do not believe it is his failure but the Government’s failure- relates to the real benefits of his work, his real achievements and the importance of having him operating as Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that all those areas in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been involved, and continues to be involved, are very much the subject of continuing debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is, whatever the nature of the report that comes from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, that it tends to stay within the ambit of the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if we are spending the amount of money that it costs to have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox operate as an ambassador-at-large, then the information that he gleans as an ambassador-at-large ought not to be available just simply to the executive of the day but also ought to be available to the Parliament and through the Parliament, it ought to be available to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the range of issues which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has pointed out in the past? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox operating as a public relations arm of this Government so that he will prove or substantiate its view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality, of course, is that most of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s recommendations are honoured more in the breach than in their observance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as one of his colleagues is concerned,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox ought to be sacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr)  shows their real attitude to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that so long as it can keep  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as ambassador-at-large wandering around the world he can produce as many memoranda as he likes, he can tell the Government of the problems and the threats that are posed to the people of Australia by nuclear profliferation, he can tell the people of Australia and the Government that we have not solved the problems of nuclear waste disposal, he can point out all these problems, but they will stay within the confines of the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I commend this amendment to the House because what it says is that the Parliament ultimately will accept responsibility for the extension of the appointment or any further appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the amendment to the House because I believe it gives the Parliament some say in the future of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should seek internally consistent packages whenever amendments to either system are contemplated, in order to provide greater <span class="highlight">justice</span>, both for those who receive assistance and for those who currently provide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in his response to our report, does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the amount of work which went into the investigations and ultimate report of the Standing Committee on Expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else Mitchell is still the Commissioner, I would hope that he would take this report and the report of the Queensland officials into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope also made it quite clear that State police special branches should remain an integral part of the overall intelligence system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At that time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Perrignon had been appointed  chairman  of the appeal tribunal to tighten up police discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The police are in the vanguard of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the appearance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and for the protection of the standing of the police, the procedure cannot be left wholly to the police themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that investigations and determinations satisfy the demand that <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not only be done, but also be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, he put the blame on the Aboriginal people for delaying the Ranger development for six years when, in fact, his Government had caused several delays and the whole project was not up for discussion until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox had made his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the 1977 Enquiry under the honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. T. Ludeke, the Government proposed increases less than those sought by the AMA, and opposed some ‘catch-up’ elements in the AMA’s proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government agreed to this proposal and announced on 1 March 1979 the establishment of the 1979 Medical Fees Enquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An application for land at Lake Nash was lodged with the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner, the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, in September 1975 but hearings were adjourned sine die on 10 November 1975 because the lessee indicated a willingness to negotiate with the Aboriginals for a sub-lease of part of the property to be used as a living area for the resident Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1974 Second Report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward commented that ‘this is obviously a very drastic penalty and it is not surprising that it has never been invoked’ (paragraph 218). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s recommendation, the amended provision now provides a penalty of $2,000 for interference with the full and free exercise of the rights reserved to Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will conclude by saying that I thought it was a basic tenet of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> that a man was presumed innocent until proved guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only now by looking at the facts that we have had put before us, not in this Parliament but in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White’s report tabled in the South Australian Parliament on matters of which we have some vague knowledge here, that we know that the intelligence service after Chifley ‘s time were virtually diverted to political actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, on 28 February this year, that is, before this legislation was introduced, the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman)  was able to boast in this House that he had greatly enjoyed the opportunity to cross-examine at length the DirectorGeneral of ASIO,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reeks of the same attitude as that disclosed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in South Australia that anyone who is seen to be to the left of a mythical but very conservative centre is not to be trusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me quote from page 7 of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of statement and this sort of so-called tax <span class="highlight">justice</span> are why this Prime Minister is now a national joke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It restores twice-yearly indexation of pensions- a measure which on the grounds of basic <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play should not have been changed a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The completion of this election promise is obviously the first priority in providing some <span class="highlight">justice</span> for country people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a radio program allegations were made, all of which at the moment are untested by any version of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as we know it in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am asking for, on behalf of all the Jews who were persecuted, hounded and killed without trial during the war, is the kind of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that would have prevented that sort of thing from happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision was brought down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers, I think on 7 August, to grantthe relevant injunctions which the Attorney-General had sought against the selfstyled charge- d’affaires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, yesterday, as is his right under the law of this country,  Mr Despoja  lodged a notice of appeal against the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, let me tell you: We have eased the means test in relation to the TEAS allowance and we have at last demonstrated that we are prepared to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done in relation to students but that money is not squandered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, on this side of the House, do believe in social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before doing so, the matter was brought to me for my reaction by the Acting Leader of the House, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, and I indicated to him that in my view the precedents were that this Parliament should do what it can to facilitate the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the courts and that we could not obstruct that if we could allow a course to be adopted without interfering with the ancient privilege of Parliament, that ancient privilege being no benefit to individual members but the ability of and the freedom for members of Parliament to speak the truth and to demand the truth within the Parliament without action being taken outside the Parliament to challenge what was said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that it is possible, we all wish to assist the work of the courts and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of this new building has been expanded by some millions at the personal whim of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come to my notice that in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 23 August 1979  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Begg issued an order in the case of Uren v. John Fairfax and Sons Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me  Mr Speaker,  that the action of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Begg may have infringed the privileges of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges- The extent to which the House might facilitate the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> with respect to the use of or reference to the records of proceedings of the House in the Courts without derogation from the Privileges of the House, or of its Members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think any petition, no matter which side of the House it comes from, should ever be granted unless the House is unanimous that the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be furthered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot have the cause of <span class="highlight">justice</span> furthered by a majority of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst everyone is anxious to facilitate the cause of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I do not think the motion ought to be on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, the Committee has agreed that it would not be able to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the inquiry if it attempted to rush through a report simply to meet the deadline contained in the resolution of appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner it is introduced the more <span class="highlight">justice</span> we will have for all the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some time the principle of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been explicitly recognised in the Australian wage system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, liberalism stirred strongly again, as expressed by Hayek when he warned the world of a new serfdom, a trend to collectivism, disguised with the trappings of equality and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They came in droves to the front of this House to beg for the 50c that the McMahon Government gave them as an increase, and then, when the Government was forced into recognising that pensioners were entitled to <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the rate of pension, it formalised the procedures of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> has now been restored to pensioners and this Government claims some sort of credit for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All it has done is correct an injustice which was perpetrated upon the pensioners of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With one stroke of the pen, the Liberal Treasurer of this nation  (Mr Howard)  could strike a blow for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and give the opportunity for the continuing separate existence of the only regional trading bank in the Australian private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are part of the reason for the Labor Party’s commitment to social <span class="highlight">justice</span> which unfortunately in this day and age is not shared by the Government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the previous members for Grayndler have always been men who have fought for social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their State, in their Party and in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget has been a responsible Budget, a measured Budget, one that takes account of the economic circumstances of our time and one that extends social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me tell honourable members what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said in the last decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no sense of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and it has no understanding of the extreme problems that Australian families are facing today trying to make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No measures ever submitted to any legislature offer greater prospects of the establishment of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the removal of inequalities . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, we are striving under a government that has the responsibility and is prepared to accept it, to look after all sections of the community and to try to dispense <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One month ago yesterday, on 13 August, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron completed the hearing on Metro’s application for a Federal award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the debate was interrupted, I was talking about comments made by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in the report he made on the Special Branch in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we find  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White making this point: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White used to describe the security recording system of South Australia were that it was ‘wasteful’ and it was ‘objectionable’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in talking about departures by ASIO from the principles of propriety and legality, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government’s two appointees to ASIO were  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the present appointee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we want to provide for retrospectivity in relation to appeals on security assessments, as was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the honourable member to resume his speech but it might be as well if he withdrew his remark in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report on intelligence and security  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope continued: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope was very discreet, but let us not pretend that we did not have our own McCarthyism in this society in the 1950s, that we did not have our own anti-communist hysteria and we did not have ASIO involved in the slime of those events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope points out, there was much bias, inaccuracy and sheer waste involved in the material collected by ASIO in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was also made very clear in the examination done by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in South Australia when he looked at the work of the Special Branch in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, much of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White’s report indicates that anything slightly left wing was treated as subversive and therefore worthy of the surveillance of the Special Branch agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not prepared to leave this legislation unchallenged because the present operators responsible for ASIO, the Attorney-General,  Senator Durack,  and the Director-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, are men of integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, more importantly, neither  Senator Durack  nor  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is immortal and there will be other men working under the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think it is more difficult than was recognised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if this relationship is satisfactorily solved, if both the Nixon danger and the Salisbury danger are avoided- that is, if we get a satisfactory balance between the Executive and the agency- the problem is not solved because, as <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope notes in his third report, often the Executive becomes very perfunctory about its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it must be said of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope that he is rather cavalier about the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope dismisses all of these proposals for the Parliament to play a role in ASIO- he says that none of those things are possible and that Parliament cannot play a rolebut at the same time he maintains that ASIO has a role in supervising individual politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, because of what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope said, in this Bill the Government gives no role whatsoever to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak as one who recalls very vividly the raid on ASIO by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we are lucky, as I think previous speakers on both sides of the House and speakers in the other place have acknowledged, that the current Director-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, is a person of great integrity and a person who will carry out his duties as this Parliament would like to see them carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the history of ASIO goes back to 1949 when the then Prime Minister sent a letter to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed appointing him Director-General of Security and requesting him to establish and operate a security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed had been replaced by the then  Colonel C.  C. F. Spry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope indicated at paragraph 1 17 of his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of situation was also the subject of very strong and adverse comment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White, in his inquiry into the situation in South Australia, found as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was concerned to hear him argue so illogically that the same sorts of standards and prescriptions that apply to a company or a trade union- which is a public organisation, a voluntary organisation, like a company, with rules laid down- ought to apply to a security service, in the face of the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and in the face of all the body of accumulated evidence that the laws have been broken and the rights of the ordinary citizen have been transgressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But are we proposing anything more than a periodic investigation of the kind made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, an updating of his report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reports from that meeting indicate that one of the main opponents of the motion was  Senator Lionel  Murphy, now a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in paragraph 10 of his fourth report, stated:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope also stated that he rejects the view that espionage is not a significant problem in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially we must remember that ASIO is an intelligence organisation; it is not a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope warned: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope also said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found that in the final analysis Ministers are the ones for whom intelligence advice is produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope implied that ASIO may have exceeded its powers and engaged in activities irrelevant to its functions and which may have impinged on individual freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do believe that we could quite easily have recourse to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court of Australia- not to a Supreme Court of a State or anyone else but to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court of Australia- in matters such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said about the general level of political sophistication inside ASIO that he saw little evidence that the qualities of mind and expertise needed in intelligence assemblies were recognised in any large measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That royal commission, under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, brought down its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that we should accept the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also told that we should accept that the present DirectorGeneral of ASIO,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, is a man of integrity and that we can trust him not to carry out any of the excesses of his predecessors in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have great admiration for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and can only express my amazement that the Fraser Government has left him in his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me give honourable members a horrific example from a democratic country of how an essentially paranoid view about secrecy can create general hysteria and distort and pervert the traditional norms of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask leave of the House to incorporate in  Hansard  paragraphs 208 to 221 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s fourth report on the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the key paragraph, paragraph 208, in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope says:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude from my reading of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report that ASIO in its present form lacks the sophistication and capacity to evaluate that we should expect from an intelligence organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope’s third report and to several quotations which I think the House ought to take careful note of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 5 of the third report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in summing up quotes Professors M. S. McDougal, H. D. Lasswell and W. M. Reisman on the intelligence function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One page 6 of the same report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope wrote: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, referring to what ASIO was doing in the trade union area, wrote: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, after a most thorough investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that the Bill does give effect substantially to the second and fourth reports of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The published and unpublished- I stress the unpublished partreports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope are a disturbing documentation of a security service that had been in disarray, a security service that lived on a reputation that was undeserved in the 1960s and early 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking for the Opposition, we believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has done much to rectify those deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope established this- ASIO was a badly demoralised organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, in the published reports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope it is clear that ASIO had been engaging in illegal activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 1 8  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 20  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that we have a great deal of confidence in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and what he can do, but what about after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ordinary <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that the public must be protected against the misuse of information gathered by ASIO for sinister and often petty political vendettas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found that ASIO’s financial procedures are capable of some improvement, though we are not told why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the 344,000 Public Service applicants who, according to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report were subject to ASIO checks over the last five years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one doubts the integrity and sincerity of the present Director-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, but some powers of his office which the Minister cannot override may require some final check or audit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I close in congratulating the Royal Commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope for its deliberations and findings, the governments which initiated the inquiry and accepted the Commission’s reports, and those who have, in the public interest, examined the implications and voiced their fears and concerns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had proposed to ask the head of my Department to seek the assistance of the Public Service Board in this review, but I was aware that the Federal Narcotics Bureau falls also within the terms of reference of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and that the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, therefore, could be making recommendations in relation to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than wait until then, I raised with the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  the question whether we might seek  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ views on matters relating to the organisation and control of the Narcotics Bureau ahead of his final report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government raised the matter formally with  His Excellency  the Governor-General and with the Royal Commissioner with the result that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams agreed that he would provide an interim report dealing with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is an interim report and the subject will be fully covered in the final Royal Commission report, and because the Royal Commissioner has included in the interim report a number of matters of confidential evidence and observations which ordinarily would not be made public,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has preferred that this interim report be treated as confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government appreciates very much the assistance and co-operation that it has had from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think it wise that the Government used the services of the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been extremely unwise if the Government had made decisions without the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams in this sensitive area being made known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition accepts the Minister’s assurance that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has asked for this section of his report to be treated as confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that we accept that this interim report from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams is of a confidential nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has asked that it be kept strictly confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a full report later that will contain all of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a long lapse of time there was a judicial audit of that State ‘s intelligence organisation and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White clearly indicated that there had been a failure to understand what intelligence organisations are supposed to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As evidenced by the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White, files were collected on people simply because they went to a meeting suggesting that peace might break out in the world or they went to a communist book shop or they belonged to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in the last 18 months, in the New South Wales courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, we had a learned Queen’s Counsel asking a plaintiff whether there was a security report about a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White gives, for the first time, an independent analysis of what was happening when this organisation or its equivalent was endeavouring to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White made the point that a significant proportion of the files related to political, trade union and other such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated in paragraph 266 of his fourth report, volume I: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then goes on, and I must say I disagree with this statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will sum up my feelings by referring to the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, which reflect exactly how I felt at the time and what I hoped would be the way in which he would report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point that was made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was that ASIO had been guilty in the past of departure from its basic functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other matter to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred was also a worry to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer again to the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, who expressed my views perfectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in these cases there should be an authority that scrutinises the exercising of those two powers to see whether they have been exercised in fairness and in <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the responsibility for drafting the definition should be taken away for the moment from the Parliamentary Counsel and submitted to an independent senior counsel, either in New South Wales or Victoria, to draft clauses which would bring these powers within the total concept of the Bill and ensure that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that there is proper control of the exercising of these powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard I would have liked to have seen the use of words much the same as those used by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  in the amendment he moved to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, that is, that there should be periodical judicial audits- again I emphasise that they should be only by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court- to ensure that the work of the Organisation complies with its charter and the law, that it does not unjustifiably infringe civil liberties, which is the most important matter of them all, and that it operates effectively and efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following previous speakers, I should like to add my warm congratulations to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward for the excellent manner in which he is performing his duty as Director-General of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill before us today constitutes for the most part the Government’s response to the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a variety of ways, the Government’s Bills do not accord with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, I have great regard for the fine work  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has carried out since his appointment by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my Leader the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  asked in his speech earlier today: What happens after  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward retires? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investigations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and in South Australia by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White and  Mrs <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mitchell provided salutary lessons in the value of a judicial audit or a review of our security processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like now to refer to <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell’s report on the dismissal of Special Branch Commissioner Salisbury as an example of the sensitivities which exist in the area of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell sums up her own views by saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would then be relying on the merits of the judiciary- not on some pimp or minor individual but a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court- to look at what has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope endeavoured to say: Subversion does mean overthrow and ruin; it does have a direct relation to activity associated with the immediate overthrow of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the term ‘low grade operatives’ because there is a tendency when speaking of ASIO to feel that all is well because it has a DirectorGeneral of integrity in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have abundant evidence of that in what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White said following his investigation in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The product of the kinds of attitudes to subversion contained in this definition leads to the abuses described by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in his report on the South Australian Special Branch in the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads the Hope report one will see that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was not at all impressed by the calibre of the ASIO agents who would be seen to exercise judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, if honourable members read the Hope report they will see that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did not have any confidence in the ability of employees of ASIO to reach such judgments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Whitlam Government established the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without straying too far from the clause, I remind honourable members that they should bear in mind that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said that the most dangerous groups happened to be the right wing radical groups that existed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he looks at the Hope report he will find that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred quite specifically to numerous occasions on which, for reasons which he made clear in his report, he was not prepared to enumerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable gentleman to look at the details of the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was not wanting to take up the time of the House, but let me inform the honourable gentleman that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White did explain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not mind accepting the judgment of the present Director-General of security as to how that might be read, or the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope or somebody like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is this: If one does not look at organisations and envisage them as being in due course led into a situation in which they can create problems then one does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the duties of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, let me take a moment to refer to some of the things said by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard for the individual rights and freedoms of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to another statement of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, particularly to answer a statement made by the honourable member for Fadden  (Mr Donald Cameron) Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that no man or woman in this world is perfect and therefore it is understandable that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, it was, in fact, a recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope that the word be used in the juxtaposition of the three fundamental elements of the meaning of subversion as provided for in clause 5 ( 1 ) (a). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had to say on the question of intelligence skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the whole course of ASIO has been changed since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made those remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should look at what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said about adverse reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said, this creates injustice that can flow on for a lifetime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of an accident of numbers some years ago which denied the then government a majority membership of the Senate and, I think it is fair to say, because of the reformist zeal of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy when Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and of other members of the Senate, the Senate’s procedures have changed dramatically over the last 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope the second definition of ‘subversion’ is given as overthrow by force and undermining by unlawful means and the definition of ‘subversive activity ‘ is given as overthrow of the Constitution by revolution or sabotage, overthrow by force or violence and destruction of Commonwealth property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one also looks at the section of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report as to trade unions one will see that it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upshot of the conclusion by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is that intelligence collected by ASIO could be referred to the Department of Industrial Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that it may be fair enough to collect intelligence on the activities of people within trade unions, but I do not think that our amendment conflicts in any way with what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said about the communication of intelligence about trade unions or with what ASIO said when it put up some definition of subversion to the Royal Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, the trade unions are performing very creditably indeed, thank you very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made a damning indictment of ASIO’s past activities when he said:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is little wonder that we of the Opposition do not trust the objectivity of ASIO’s agents when we look at that sort of material which has been written by the learned <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope and, I add, the report on which this legislation is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite take pride in having appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if there is to be <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all then these two areas should be seen in parallel and should be given some recognition in unison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the shadow Minister in this area I have developed a comprehensive program for lowering telephone costs across the community, reducing the problems faced by country subscribers and bringing the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of community need, not the greed of private capital, into the forefront of government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be quite clear that they are abusing the principle of insurance, which is that those who are in need can gain a transfer from those who are not so much in need, and that they are abusing the principle of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> within a tax system where some pay and some benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that has been put forward from time to time- namely, to pull the young and the healthy out of the health insurance system- is an abuse not only of Beveridge ‘s principles but also of reasonable principles of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the dispute was in its infancy  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, in criticising both the Government and the Telecommunications Commission, referred the parties to the dispute to a conference in an endeavour to find a way around a legitimate claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-<span class="highlight">Justice</span> demands that some explanation be given by the Government of the affairs that have taken up so much time of the Parliament over the past two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-12-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If for no other reason but in the interest of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it is the correct thing to do to wait until the report that is referred to as the Finnane report is available for the perusal and consideration of all members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-12-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has already said that the unions have sought to get the Commission to do indirectly what it has no power to do directly, namely, prescribe conditions on matters which do not pertain to the relationship between employers and employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and an anomaly in the law which should be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that argument is seriously put forward, then it follows that members of the Labor Party, trade union officials, are quite justified in believing that if they went before the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who went from a senior position as a Liberal Minister in this Parliament to the position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, there would be no fairness nor any <span class="highlight">justice</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any member of the Labor Party or any trade unionist appearing before him would be justified in believing that there would be neither fairness nor <span class="highlight">justice</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a good form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country and he has every opportunity to clear his name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to look at the political colour of everybody who sits in <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refuted allegations that have been made and really highlighted the point that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has to be done in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, that is proof of an innocent man wanting to see <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a perversion of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a prostitution of the laws of this country to carry out a conspiracy of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say, and I will say it whatever it means on either side of the House, that whenever there is political interference in the administration of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> there are grave dangers to our democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the whole of the discipline of the law was directed towards the meticulous observance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in its clear sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any person who has any feel for history and fairness and who has any capacity to identify with <span class="highlight">justice</span>, should feel outraged that this proceeding has gone on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to my honourable friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding),  without any hostility from one to the other that surely we have not forgotten the great principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very properly the Leader of the Opposition said: ‘Well, does that mean to say that if you appeared before the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia who sat in this House as a Liberal member and Minister, you would complain about that?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not have the slightest hesitation in appearing before  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, in any jurisdiction, but I say that if  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Finnane  has despised two of the great principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and nobody seems to care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister will give the Opposition sufficient notice of the announcement of the Government’s response to the recommendations to enable us to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the debate which will take place in this chamber and in the community at large on this very important issue affecting the city of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>254,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor of the High Court said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitution therefore authorises Parliament to legislate for the establishment of a tribunal to which the parties to industrial disputes of the specified character are compelled to submit their differences and which, in the exercise of its arbitral functions, is bound to proceed, according to the principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to hear the parties and to determine the matters in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem, therefore, that the process of conciliation and arbitration contemplated by the Constitution involves the application of the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In normal circumstances, natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires that he who decides must also hear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the requirements of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> are not fixed but vary according to all the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> which apply in respect of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are offended by the requirement to consult as proposed in new section 22A will require determination by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a recent decision in the case of Costain Australia Pty Ltd and the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union of Australia,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission commented that there was no proper basis for payment for time lost as a result of industrial action unless the actions of the employer were so extreme that the refusal to work was the only reasonable course left open to the employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members read any of the works that have been produced in relation to the effects of the compulsory arbitration system, such as those by  Foernander  and Portus, or any of the other individuals, or even by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He again simply criticised the Minister and the Government and, like other speakers, quoted as his guide and philosopher a previous man from the Bench in the person of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course he said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby had put the view that this legislation was adverse, that it was contrary to what would be the wish of the bench, and that it was also contrary to the wish of those who understood the requirements of industrial relations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of fair play, honesty and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the ALP consulted, for instance,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples when it wrote its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the lesson of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the lessons of the rule of law that were taught last week in this House by the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  would have registered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the rule of law which honourable members heard about from the lips of the Minister for Defence would have made them understand that in this legislation the Full Bench makes the decision, not the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually, on 19 September, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission handed down a decision against the employers justifying the claims of the men to work under a State award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this hearing <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron handed to the parties two telegrams that had been forwarded to the  Deputy  Registrar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This report contained a draft Defence (Discipline and <span class="highlight">Justice</span>) Bill, prepared by the working party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members I present material received in January 1979 from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples concerning human rights together with the text of a statement by the Attorney-General relating to the material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where does the Minister find <span class="highlight">justice</span> for putting forward the argument that there has to be total consistency in the decisions being made by the Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be seen to be done is if anybody making a decision- in the civil courts or the industrial arena- makes it on the basis of having heard both sides of the argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from its being an obvious insult to the commissioners the question of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">justice</span> also is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a presidential member is to make a decision not on the merits of the case but on questions of general policy, I put it to the Committee that that is contrary to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions by both the High Court and the Privy Council in the boilermakers case are based upon the fact that section 51 (xxxv) requires the establishment of a tribunal which will proceed according to the principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and hear the parties before determining the matters in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority decision handed down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke read:  a law which enables a body of persons to settle a dispute by issuing a decree arrived at by discussion amongst themselves without any hearing or determination between the disputants is, in our opinion, not a law with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and is not authorised by sec. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there will be cases when this will deny substantial <span class="highlight">justice</span> to any parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole traditional concept of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> meant that the parties had an opportunity to be heard, to present evidence and to rebut it before the person making the judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the ultimate judgment is to be part of a consultative process in which A who has heard the evidence is forced to justify himself before B who has not heard the evidence there will be a complete upsetting of the tradition of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there have been allegations by the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  that the requirement was offensive, and by the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  that it would infringe natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of the settlement of industrial disputes in this country harks back to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins and the principles that have been built up over years and years of discussion and people applying themselves in an endeavour to resolve industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were so obvious a breach of the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the matter might be challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This then raises the question of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that it can be justified is because the Commission itself- <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudronoverturned the sentiments that were expressed by the Prime Minister in this House some months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the most recent case of the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union of Australia v. Costain in 1979,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley stated the position of the Commission when he said that there was no proper basis for payment for time lost as a result of industrial action unless the actions of the employer were so extreme that the refusal to work was the only reasonable course open to the employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that, as with the preceding clause, the clause before the Committee represents a real limitation on the powers on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to bring about effective <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is very far removed from the concept of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we were talking about earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the Government is able to stand down people who are not gainfully employed and it can ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done by the revenue which is provided by the taxpayer, who is the ultimate employer of people in essential services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, I cannot remember whether he is a knight or not - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we ought to recall the way in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers summarised the actions of the Builders Labourers Federation at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did a tribunal headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke which investigated doctors’ fees recommend an average increase in fees of some 13 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister taking any action to enforce the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Prime Minister whether he has had private discussions with the Catholic bishops on the report on unemployment prepared for them by the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and I did have discussions on that document with representatives of the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace and with three Catholic bishops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is this sort of personal approach to the question of administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the depths to which the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has deteriorated in New South Wales under the Attorney-General,  Mr Walker,  who has become the John Mitchell of Australian politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very much at variance, in fact, with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell’s statement in 1972 when the Grants Commission was originally set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice, and it is very unfortunate, that a lot of bitterness is creeping into the reasons for the preparation of the document prepared by the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace for the Catholic bishops of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, the statement was a letter which I understand  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples circulated to his Conciliation and Arbitration Commission colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not consider anything said by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples in his statement as warranting any reexamination of the legislation that the Government has before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was one of the matters referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and the Government still believes that it is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister for Industrial Relations give this House a firm assurance that no member of his staff was responsible for the distribution of copies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples ‘ letter referring to the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to people outside his office such as representatives of the Press? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Government has sought to put a noose around the impartiality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and its practice in conciliation and arbitration procedures in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any government propose that legislation which is to provide the essentials of <span class="highlight">justice</span> can function when the people who have to administer and to deliberate upon those principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> have no confidence in it and condemn it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 28 September  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples circularised his fellow commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 October or 2 October the Minister’s office received at least one copy- it is suggested that there were three copies- of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 1 October, after the telex from the commissioners had been received in the Minister’s office, a member of the Minister’s staff circulated copies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter to his fellow presidential members, to commissioners of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and to members of the Press in the Press Gallery in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was all part of an exercise designed by the Government to try to destroy the credibility and standing of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government did was to embark upon a program of vilification based on fictitious assertions in a desperate effort to try to undermine any credibility that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples might have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote another case from earlier this year when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Matthews,  President  of the Queensland Industrial Court, called the court into special session and from the Bench castigated the Premier and the  President  of the National Party,  Sir Robert  Sparkes, for their attempted interference in the affairs of his court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was subsequently disclosed that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Matthews had instructed the Crown Law Office to commence necessary proceedings against the Premier for contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street and  Sir Garfield  Barwick neither advice was given from the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been an expedition to blacken  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government panicked after it received the telex of 10 October and on 11 October it sought to gag debate and at the same time embarked on a program to blacken  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a question asked of me at Question Time today by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  in which he asked whether any member of my staff made available copies of a statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples dated 28 September 1979 concerning the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that were then before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to what the Leader of the Opposition said about allegations regarding  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ comments, namely, that there was an implied threat to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples in my mentioning that I referred  His  Honour’s letter to the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  for the Attorney-General’s comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the questions raised about the constitutionality or otherwise of the amendments, naturally I wanted the Attorney-General to look specifically at the points raised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have now received the Attorney-General’s comments and he has reaffirmed the advice which I gave earlier and which he gave to me; that is, that there is nothing in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ comments in his letter which would lead the Attorney-General to change his advice to the Government that the amendments are in fact constitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that the legislation will stand up to a High Court challenge, and has dismissed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ criticisms by pointing out that he is a former member of the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said today that he did not release  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter until PM had exposed the letter in its program last Thursday night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in those events the criticisms of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and the commissioners fall on very deaf ears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples said of what happened in New South Wales: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In April 1 979, 26 judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court including the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Laurence  Street signed a letter which was critical of a proposal by New South Wales Attorney-General  Mr Walker  to create a new Criminal Law Division in the Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the impartiality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and talked about the damage to the conciliation and arbitration system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He kicked the communist can, he attacked the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Commonwealth and talked about the denigration of the Government in wanting the Commission to be the puppet of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The courts have to administer <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all, the Government has frequently relied on the authority of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to note that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his very comprehensive suggestions for the definition of subversion’, did not include in that definition the words ‘promoting hatred between different groups of persons in the Australian community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, insofar as the Government itself has relied very much on the authority of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, it is not justified in doing so in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went through very carefully the various possibilities of this definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus this House should support the Opposition amendment because inciting hatred between groups is very difficult to define; secondly,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has not recommended this in the definition; and thirdly, it strikes at the heart of the conflicted political system that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said in his report, volume 1, page 219, paragraph 461, on the question of a bipartisan attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope quotes what Rebecca West says in her  The New Meaning of Treason :  and this (to lift matters out of party politics) is indeed necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed new clause is completely in accordance with what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said about bipartisanship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the House to the very strong and principled statements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on this very issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White’s report on the special branch in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White goes on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White makes the point that members who were interested in, for example, university activities and civil liberties were all brought under notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that there was a very real difference of approach, for example, between the late  Senator Greenwood  and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy in the discharge of their roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come back to these words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my home State at present a retired <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a senior police officer are going through the process of extracting and burning the files on some hundreds of thousands of perfectly reputable citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the Hope report, on which this Australian Security Intelligence Organization Amendment Bill was supposed to have been based, they will see that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope contradicts himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may trust  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there anything to say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward will always be the same person that he was when he was appointed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward could be as susceptible to that old saying as any other human being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was contradicting himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly obvious in these matters that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope expected that the Executive arm of government should have the final control over the DirectorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals are an endeavour to work out that authority in some more detail following the comments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Cunningham said that we had taken no notice of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He quoted  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the few instances, as we see it, in which the Government has departed from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations in a more liberal rather than illiberal direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s recommendations - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations as allowing too much room for limitation of the scope of ministerial power and responsibility, allowing too much residual authority to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the very personal qualities that make  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward an admirable Director-General of Security I believe are wrongly put about in this debate by honourable members saying: ‘There is nothing to worry about in the legislation; do not worry about it because we have such an excellent DirectorGeneral, somebody appointed by the Labor Government and kept on by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are making laws and we have to consider what those laws are and what the situation would be like if, for example,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spry were resurrected as DirectorGeneral and if, say, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  were the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One notices the position in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not give us any guarantee of that, but  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his report, said: ‘Well, look, I can visualise in some cases a DirectorGeneral using his discretion and not giving any information, but the Prime Minister has to get that information’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Minister that we have received advice that last June or July the Government asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to re-examine the ministerial control clause and he came up with a different formula from what is in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I think  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope eventually decided to climb out of the narrow opening that was still left to him by saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it can be seen that 
 Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope is moving the matter into that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also inform the honourable gentleman that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was not asked to review clause 8. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is significant in view of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said in relation to the direction and control of ASIO and whether Ministers should have access to certain information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had to face up to the difficulty of how much information should be made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition wants ministerial accountability;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said that he wanted it too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is the exception to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was proved obviously by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in South Australia that it never really would happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron ruled against the company and in time enabled those men to go back to work after all that time under all the conditions that they had enjoyed before that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here a copy of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron ‘s judgment and I seek leave to have it incorporated in  Hansard, just  to prove the point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the handing down of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron’s decision, the men went back to work under a State award, which was the decision of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron knocked back those telegrams, just as I refute the evidence given here tonight by the honourable member for Hume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will recall that yesterday several questions were directed to him asking him directly whether he was responsible in some way or another, either through direct action or instruction to a member of his staff, for the distribution of a copy or copies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter to fellow commissioners of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, I had no intention of making this document public until it had become public, because, as the honourable gentleman would appreciate, there is no mileage in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter so far as the Government is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope travelled the world to gather information on how an intelligence organisation should be run in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night just before the adjournment debate I made the declaration that a tap had been placed on the private telephone of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the weekend just passed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples phoned me at my home to ask whether I knew whether there was any truth in the newspaper reports that the Minister for Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  had been the person responsible for leaking to the Press a copy of the letter of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cite no better case than the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lionel Murphy, as he now is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allegation was that a phone tap had been put on the private phone of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in volume I of the fourth report at page 2 1 9 said that he thought that that practice should continue except in very special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other allegations concerning the conduct of ASIO and  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, it is a matter of rehashing what was a great political scandal at the dme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made it clear that in the past ASIO had frequently broken the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two such audits have been held, one by  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White in South Australia and the other into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we are told that this Bill was, in a large part, a response to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could add to the report being done by  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White in South Australia the fact that the former  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nelson of the Victorian Supreme Court is performing a similar exercise in Victoria by going through and destroying files of the Special Branch of the Victorian Police Force when they are not considered to be relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost like tick-a-box <span class="highlight">justice</span> if we say to the judge: ‘We trust you so little, Joe, that we are going to make you say on which ground you have relied’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now have a copy of the letter circulated to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One after the other the newspapers said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples likened the legislation to Nazi Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the amendment curtails a provision in the Act which is intended to serve the interest that <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples sent a copy of some criticism of substantive matters to members of Parliament, including members of the Opposition, as I understand he did, or to the Minister for Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  I do not believe that he should have done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was delighted this evening to receive from the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  a full copy of the letter by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples,  Deputy President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, about the Government’s proposed changes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his wind-up,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples has stated his view quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This honourable <span class="highlight">justice</span> has complained that the Government is going to strengthen the powers of the  President  of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that they had done that with someone who was close to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, and confirmed to my staff that the extract from the transcript- ‘The judge’s letter, a copy of which came into our hands today’was correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some time later that night- about 9 o’clock- I authorised the distribution of those comments by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of nonsense has been spoken about these matters over recent days- nonsense as to what happened about a letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just to set the record straight, at the time we went to air on Thursday evening and broke the story of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘and broke the story of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples ‘ letter’- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not the slightest doubt that the Labor Party had copies of that letter, the document, from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples some considerable time before it was broken on the Huw Evans program,  PM,  on 1 1 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to read one section of the document from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, which I hold in my hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was part of the second last paragraph of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have met  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples only once, for a period of about 10 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not discussed with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before I was interrupted the point that I was making was that I have not at any stage discussed with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples his view of the proposed amendments to the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the ALP consulted, for instance,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples when it wrote its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had a fixation with the alleged benefits and the alleged qualities of <span class="highlight">justice</span> associated with the free enterprise system and the so-called free market forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to argue as the Minister does that these shortages must be forever filled by importing skilled tradesmen is a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to every unemployed young Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all people, not just a special few who continue to get privileges at the expense of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indicative of this success has been the increase in the total number of  recipients  of social welfare which is theirs injustice, not in charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those funds are theirs in <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I associate this thought with the recent statement made by the Australian Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is a government of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government has sought to do is to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> and order into a situation of utter chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we turn to what is being proposed in this legislation tonight in relation to unemployment beneficiaries, we see that it is simply a continuation of that kind of story of welfare, not in terms of the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, not in terms of delivering to people what is their right, but rather in the form of an attempt further to harass people and make them feel that somehow they have to get more into line and that somehow they are being deviant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not an ounce of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this Government in any real sense whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if that is the reason, does the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  intend restoring some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to our elderly and disadvantaged citizens by making retrospective adjustments to pensions due to the Government’s miscalculation of the rate of inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families at risk in this country need economic and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to prevent crisis situations which so often occur unnecessarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with a simple principle of economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> and applying the very logic or reason that has compelled this Government to urge and apply increases for the higher income earners in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates that are involved as so-called amendments to the Bill, in my view, having regard to the claims for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to the delay in payments, are nothing less than a public scandal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been told of the injustices that occur and, as I said, it has been the recommendation of the Commissioner for Employees Compensation that that situation be remedied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that in terms of economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> and increases in rates the Government has approached this matter in a mealy-mouthed way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they are just as important in principle in providing effective social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for employees of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the Commonwealth faced up to its responsibilities in this matter and that real <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done to what is, after all, our own work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in these payments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How in <span class="highlight">justice</span> can we justify these anomalies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had hoped that some members on the Government side would have some sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to them if they have any sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> at all they have second thoughts about it and support the amendment moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to an excellent paper given by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron at the Australian College of Education in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Catholic bishops, through their Commission on <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, have also produced a stinging indictment of the policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The report of the Commission on <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace points to the very guts of the unemployment problem in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in working communities are going to fight the fight because they know that, essentially, deep down in the Australian people, there is a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The apparent intention of the Federal Government, however, to deny unemployment benefits in the future to workers stood down as a result of a strike if the union to which they belong does not condemn the strike is a threat to the right to freedom of opinion, a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to taxpayers, and a perversion of the conventional definition of what constitutes unemployment <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This appears to have been the view of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in the St George County Council case of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of Mikasa v. Festival Stores,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen stated that the past participle often applies equally to the future as to the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When former  Senator Murphy,  now  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, moved in the Senate on 19 March 1970 for the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, he referred to the series of company crashes that had occurred in the 1960s and to the widespread evidence of improper practices during the speculative boom in mining shares in the late 1960s andhe specu early 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Emir … of Bokhara, son of the infamous Nasrullah … A pious Moslem, he had the reputation of enforcing both civil and religious laws with severity, but also with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the honourable member for St George  (Mr Neil)  not only traversed issues which by their very nature are sub judice but also, in so doing, was concerned to attack the Attorney-General of New South Wales and  Mr Finnane-  he agrees with that- as part of an ongoing campaign which suggests that company investigations which have been carried out in that State have been unique in as much as they have involved bias, prejudice and procedures which were completely at variance with any principle of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government members are the people concerned to raise these great matters of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that someone is in any way responsible for industrial action taken at another plant over which he has absolutely no power of decision making, of course, is to deny <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the person who is stood down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is always refreshing to hear someone express some sentiments from the heart, as the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock)  has done, particularly when speaking about <span class="highlight">justice</span> being done and whether some injustice appears to have been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me also put it on record that a relative of somebody who felt that there had been injustice and who had some beneficial interest in a company was repeatedly asking people, particularly members of the Press and members of parliament, to raise the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the softness of the answers in relation to the amounts of money involved in some cases, one will wonder whether <span class="highlight">justice</span> has always been done by supporters of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ministers of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, judges, criminologists and leading figures in the fields of correction, police, social welfare and generally related areas were to be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government authorised the inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope which set up a task force which brought down this remarkable report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the world-wide protests against this mockery of <span class="highlight">justice</span> perpetrated in Prague and in view of the public statements of  President  Carter,  Mrs Thatcher,  the Italian  President  and the European Parliament, will the Minister now indicate Australia’s attitude to this travesty of basic human rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court shall consist of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and so many other Justices, not less than two, as the Parliament prescribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Judiciary Act 1903, which provided for a High Court consisting of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and two other justices, included the provision:   on and after a date to be fixed by Proclamation the principal seat of the High Court shall be at the seat of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 23 provides that, in the event of there being an equal division of the High Court upon the hearing of an appeal from a judge of the High Court or from a supreme court of a State, the decision appealed from is to be affirmed and that in any other case the opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or the senior <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court present shall prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, in appeals from all courts created by this Parliament, if there is an equal division of the High Court the opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> determines the outcome of the appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has always been anxious to deny what he calls wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not make any comment upon them, but I end by saying that if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be done in this area the position of Federal members of parliament should not be confused with that which applies to State members, and I imagine that State members of parliament would not want to be confused with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Matthews in Queensland ignored the Commowealth law and made an award on the basis that the Aboriginal ought to be entitled to the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the essential features of this report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Harvey Bates, the celebrated drug trade buster, has little to sustain his reputation, or that which has been contrived by the fictitious public relations efforts conducted by him and others in the face of this searing indictment that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has brought down as only his interim report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the finding of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’s findings and recommendations are very judiciously worded, but what he is saying here- and I base this assertion on evidence publicly available from the transcript of evidence to the Royal Commission, on work hearing cases, and so on- is that fictitious results were concocted by the Narcotics Bureau and by  Mr Besley  in his evidence to the Royal Commission to mislead the Royal Commission and the public into believing that the Bureau was more successful than it had been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things, this is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams says of the Narcotics Bureau: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams also says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interim recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams make it clear that the effective functioning of anti-narcotics activity in this country in future will depend upon, first, the termination of the Narcotics Bureau; secondly, the absorption of that role by the Australian Federal Police; and, thirdly, an integrated effort between the Australian Federal Police or Commonwealth Police and those sections of the State police forces responsible for narcotics law enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams shows many parallels with the series of reports conducted by his brother judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, into Australia’s security services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as anybody talks about social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, equality, fair shares or a return for work commensurate with what others get for a return for work he is talking about some intervention in the market system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that one bad apple was identified by the Bureau in 1975, which then spared no effort to track him down and bring him to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dispute centres around the matters of substance which demolish the Bureau’s reputation and which are outlined in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams of the Supreme Court of Queensland who headed the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ reporting to the Government, at its request, within the authority of the terms of reference laid down by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are merely some of the findings which are devastatingly presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he ensure that these people receive elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the new South Australian Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will recall saying in his answer that he instructed the Narcotics Bureau to extend full co-operation to the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More specifically, did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams make any complaint to the Government about difficulties in obtaining information or the forthcomingness of witnesses from the Bureau who appeared before the Royal Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs been drawn to that section of the report on the drug inquiry by the New South Wales Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, which strongly criticised the Commonwealth for its lack of operation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister approve a policy which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward described as the Bureau ‘avoiding giving evidence’, which gravely hampered and restricted this Commission’s inquiries into heroin trafficking’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs been drawn to the finding of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report to the New South Wales Government that the Bureau of Customs has intercepted ‘probably less than 10 per cent’ of the heroin illegally imported into Australia each year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward referred to what he calls the ‘relative ease’- those are the Judge’s words- of importing heroin into this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said that new Federal Government checks were unlikely to affect significantly the flow of heroin into Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been made abundantly clear by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, as it has been made abundantly clear by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward today, not only in terms of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s condemnation of the failure to extend co-operation to his inquiry but also his assertion that he had established on the evidence available to him, the hard facts presented, that there was an absence of co-operation between the federal authority and State law enforcement authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister wants to stand by that, I challenge him to table all of the documentation that is attached to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is reported in the Royal Commission report as finding: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the considered judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the Narcotics Bureau did not measure up to the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s criticism of the lack of cooperation by the Government, by its agency, with the Royal Commission, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he has a cheek to come into the Parliament and say that, because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night the Minister sought to belittle my criticism, based on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ report, that the Federal Narcotics Bureau acted with obsessive secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister well knows the sort of secrecy of which I was critical, and it is well documented in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know now what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams said about that kind of solution to the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from any highfalutin explanations of ministerial responsibility, it would seem to me to be an outrageous breach of common <span class="highlight">justice</span> if this House were to censure a man who on three separate occasions initiated inquiries and investigations which led to the decision announced yesterday by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  to begin the disbandment of the Federal Narcotics Bureau and its transfer in the first instance to the Commonwealth Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be a very odd breach of ordinary, common <span class="highlight">justice</span> for that to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not always <span class="highlight">justice</span> to say that everybody would draw a reasonable inference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to differ in the kind of judgment they would make in respect of Brisbane airport compared with that which they made in respect of Tullamarine airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the  Deputy  Prime Minister received telexes from the New South Wales Premier requesting talks with the Commonwealth on the establishment of a centralised drug intelligence system and requesting Commonwealth co-operation for a planned visit to Bangkok by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Wran also sent me a telegram yesterday notifying me that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was thinking of making a trip to Bangkok to investigate drug matters in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it ought to be known that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has already made a trip to Bangkok. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think the sensible course at this stage would be for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to consult each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams will provide  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward with all the information that he has already obtained regarding Bangkok, and give advice as to whether such a trip is necessary and, if necessary, what matters might be looked into, when the visit might take place and what the composition of the visiting party might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second point is that there has been an inference that the Finnane inquiry is of the same status as two royal commissions, one under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams and the other under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the conduct of these trials the Soviet Government ignored its commitments in the 1977 Constitution as well as natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless we are of the opinion that the Parliament does not do itself <span class="highlight">justice</span> nor are Australia’s international relations advantaged - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is  Mr Finnane-  had not given  Mr Sinclair  and the other directors and their respective lawyers, the unprecedented degree of opportunity to place submissions and propositions before him that he did afford them, he would have been pilloried as an enemy of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer a tax system that, because of its <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, did not require indexation to maintain its partial acceptability in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the question of whether that decision would stand or whether the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> would be allowed to have a casting vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there is a vacancy in an office of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Attorney-General shall, before an appointment is made to the vacant office, consult with the Attorneys-General of the States in relation to the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not say too much, but it looks as though we are building some grandiose structure which does not seem to have much to do with <span class="highlight">justice</span> but has a lot to do with image or status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the case of a matter awaiting or under adjudication in a court of law, the House imposes a restriction upon itself to avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum to the court and to ensure that its proceedings are not permitted to interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the judges ceased to be removable at the Royal pleasure they lost a motive for regarding the Royal wishes in their administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and when at the same time they were made removable on the address of both Houses, they acquired a motive for carefulness lest their conduct on the Bench should fall under the scrutiny of the High Court of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s involvement iri the Labor lawyers conference is reported as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy’s position was made even more untenable when his former parliamentary colleague, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McClelland of the New South Wales Industrial Commission, delivered the so-called captivating after dinner speech to the same gathering of Labor lawyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to put this matter in perspective, let me ask honourable members opposite what would be their response should the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia have been invited and accepted an invitation to give a keynote address to a convention of the Liberal Party or to a conference of Liberal Party lawyers so designated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I have not received <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the law or from the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have received <span class="highlight">justice</span> from people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have received <span class="highlight">justice</span> from a jury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 feel that it is important that more people should enter this High Court debate because we are discussing the High Court which is responsible for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Real <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the people in this country is just not on at present through the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ordinary person cannot afford <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish that the narrow minded, petty and degrading honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Roger Johnston)  would understand that I am fighting in my way for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people everywhere, no matter where they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Injustice anywhere is a threat to <span class="highlight">justice</span> everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Wherever injustice is brought about I will struggle for the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we really have to talk about and to think about is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the courts for people in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they try to libel me again they will finish up in court before a jury of 12 and I will fight for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in my case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court shall consist of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and so many other justices, not less than two, as the Parliament prescribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are formulating the <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we seek we do not have control or rights over aspects that are changing within our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention as an example  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  William O. Douglas of the United States Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remarkable fact about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  William O. Douglas was that he travelled widely throughout the community both within America and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here was a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Supreme Court of the United States talking of the human problems that were going to confront us in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be a High Court <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the Constitution, one does not need to be a lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black was an appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States by a conservative administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He turned out to be one of the greatest justices in the history of the United States Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not delude ourselves into believing that <span class="highlight">justice</span> comes from the legalisms associated with the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The jury system is the major vehicle which will dispense <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we will get <span class="highlight">justice</span> from our people, the ordinary people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be planning in the long term for a building of significance in its contribution to the beauty of this city and at the same time provide a place in which the ordinary Australian may obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Victor  Windeyer was on the Bench at the time when perhaps Australia’s greatest ever Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Owen  Dixon, presided over the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Harlan of the United States Supreme Court was at that dinner as a guest of honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That meant that despite his age and, in the last years of his term as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, despite poor health,  Sir Owen  Dixon ensured that that Court went to Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we know that there will be no more sittings in Melbourne or Sydney after the new High Court is opened in Canberra, except for the purpose of taking evidence, and those hearings will take place before a single <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may say so, I think it is a proper application of the sub judice rule, both in the public interest and in the interests of this Parliament and, furthermore, in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as it is administered in the courts of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sub judice rule will prevent discussion of trial proceedings in respect of those 2 1 people and maybe another 1 32 people if they do go before the court, and for the very good reason that the sub judice rule is intended to protect the national interest- if I might put it this way- in the purity of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, against it being subverted by comment within this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that recent events would have made this Parliament very cautious about seeking to avoid the sub judice rule in a way which can taint the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have demonstrated to this House that a judicial inquiry into the circumstances related to the use of listening devices and the interception of telephone conversations by Commonwealth Police would in itself impede or hinder the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Greek conspiracy case now before a magistrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very important rule of any parliament which adopts the Westminster system that proceedings in parliament ought not to be allowed to taint, as I have said, the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the courts of this country, in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as we know it, have equal importance in our democratic processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point I would make is that in respect of committal proceedings- perhaps I have a higher view of magistrates exercising their responsibilities in those matters- my own view would be that anything that was stated in this Parliament would not affect a magistrate making a determination on the basis of the evidence before him, any more than it would affect a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Supreme Court or, indeed, even of a Full Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether a single <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be affected by any debate or anything that is said in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the sub judice rule is to protect the process of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am not interested to learn whether or not a possible injustice can be to the prosecutor as distinct from the accused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it must be the purpose of this Parliament to uphold <span class="highlight">justice</span> being performed, whatever the outcome of the courts is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not inconsistent with fundamental rights and duties, the House should avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum or body of inquiry or permit its proceedings to interfere in the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from particular matters such as criminal cases, courts material, civil cases and matters referred by a legislature to a judicial body, the rule has application to other hearings, inquiries or investigations in which the rights of individuals or a community group or the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct you also to the view expressed by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales in 1937. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a working member of the Australian Journalists Association I have sympathy and understanding about the difficulties of rendering both <span class="highlight">justice</span> and mercy to members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also agree that the legislation climaxes or finalises negotiations which have been going on for some two years and which I believe mean not only a solution but also <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the Australian sugar industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come back to the basic point that the industry is getting <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent that dance from occuring it was decided that money spent on education ought to be so spent and ought to have a role in developing fair shares and a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a sense of fair distribution, we must look at the distribution of public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government: What type of security can a retired public servant feel and what sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is operating when, because he was a Commonwealth public servant rather than a State or authority servant, he is falling further behind in his standard of living, which even under the new rates that recently came into force can hardly be called affluent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that, following the bombing at the Sydney Hilton Hotel in February last year,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the New South Wales Supreme Court was appointed to conduct a review of the whole area of protective security in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has now completed his task and recently presented his report to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope received full co-operation from all these persons and the Commonwealth Government joins with him in thanking them for their assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I record the Government’s appreciation of the valuable contribution that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s review has made to our consideration of the important field of protective security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We attach very considerable importance to this joint Commonwealth-State body and share the view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope that much can be achieved through it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first issue to be decided has been the extent to which the text of the report may be made public, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has made recommendations in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope also stated the view, which we endorse, that as much of the material in the report be published as is possible without endangering security or the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect it will be recalled that the Government followed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations regarding publication of the reports of his Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security in 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth endorses the general rule, enunciated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, that in any battle against terror the local law enforcement authorities in the normal processes of the criminal law must be in the vanguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, as he has done on previous occasions on matters of great public responsibility, where he has had a brief to carry out a review of such matters, has again in this report performed his task diligently, intelligently and with considerable beneficial effect for those people in the community, in government and other institutions serving government in the community who have to take decisions in these matters and have to respond to actual problems which may arise affecting security or prepare for the potential that may rest within the community from whatever cause for that sort of threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in this report, has very nicely made the distinction, in my view, between the role of the police force and that of the armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope makes the distinction that the circumstances in which the armed forces should be called into operation are in what would very largely be a civilian problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distinction that is asserted in those paragraphs by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is a very important one and one that we must not lose sight of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no sense of equity or <span class="highlight">justice</span> except in an inverse way, as a consequence of which it believes that lower income earners should pay more tax and higher income earners should pay less tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a simple matter of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the child and the mother should be entitled to the same rights as a civilian widow with a child on a social security pension, without having to accept the penalty that she must surrender her entitlements as a war widow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say that the building seems to be intended as a monument, either contemporary or posthumous, to the learned Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Prime Minister who insists that ‘<span class="highlight">justice</span> must be done and must be seen to be done’ when he seeks to protect the interests of an international corporation, but who conspires with his Cabinet for three months to try to bury allegations of electoral boundary rigging made against one of his Ministers by a member of his own party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: The Narcotics Bureau, which has been demolished, the Commonwealth Police scandal which is not a Greek conspiracy but rather a conspiracy of Compol against the Greek community which has resulted in the Commonwealth Police being discredited, and the damage done to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation last week with the tabling of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report on security arrangements in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an internal security agency which is seriously damaged by the latest disclosures and the latest criticisms by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope as to the way in which it operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ASIO can no longer have any respect as a result of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s disclosures last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members could not explain how on the one hand  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward warns what everyone knows in the community- that is, that major ports like Sydney are wide open to access by hard drugs like heroin and that Sydney is about to be flooded by the drug- when there are repeated reports over extended periods that hard drugs are coming into Australia from the Golden Triangle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Protective Security Report of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope said a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It behoves us in this debate and throughout the course of this week not to transgress that rule by trying to get behind it through the back door because it is a very important rule in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that anything concerning criminal prosecutions that are before the court and that would in any way taint or hinder the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not be debated in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was this Government which substantially accepted the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope from an inquiry into ASIO instituted by the former Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That cannot in any way be a dereliction of duty but rather in the strongest possible way the carrying out of the responsibility of the Government towards ASIO in the face of the recommendations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also point out that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams at first considered that the interim report should be withheld- that is, kept confidential- until such time as his final report was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government in consultation with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams thought it appropriate that we should act on it with promptness before the final report was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is based on the second interim report of the Company Law Advisory Committee chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, the present Commissioner, has expressed the view that the Minister has the power to accept all or part of a Land Commissioner’s recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That proposed sub-section is altogether too precise and would take away the discretion of the judge or the <span class="highlight">justice</span> who was hearing the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem arose as a result of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have before me some of the views expressed in what I choose to call the edited version- not the final version- of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 8  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wiliams states- this is of vital importance to us all and is the reason why this Bill was brought into being: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope which has been tabled in the Parliament, he outlined a list of their weaknesses, ranging from scandalously bad cooperation between police forces to fragmented intelligence collection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams in respect of drug trafficking- and that is what this legislation is all about- states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, if we had not appointed  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams I wonder whether we would have found out how ineffective and incompetent the Narcotics Bureau has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, of the New South Wales Royal Commission, is going overseas, to investigate drug problems, and we welcome his endeavours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had a permanent appraisal of the situation we would go very close to giving these criminals the <span class="highlight">justice</span> they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(b) The Government approved a recommendation of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although that legislation did give effect to many of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, there were some differences of opinion between the two parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view was taken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report- he was asked to report only on the Northern Territory- that an examination of the State position would take much longer but that what was done in the Northern Territory would provide something of a precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, if we are to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the work of the Joint Committee and other committees in this place, we ought to be given the opportunity in a reasonable way to receive reports and to comment on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the Committee thought that does not help the situation and I am surprised that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Federal Court of Australia would create the impression, probably unwisely, that members of Parliament would take lawful or unlawful means to avoid publicly declaring their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures do not include the costs, met by my Department, in respect of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to countries which may not share the basic criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system applicable in Australia, very careful consideration would have to be given to the basis for any transfer arrangements to ensure that persons transferred from Australia not only received treatment in accordance with our notions of penal <span class="highlight">justice</span> but that they would also be required to undergo imprisonment for a sufficient period, in accordance with their Australian sentence, to deter them from breaches of Australia’s fisheries legislation in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps have been taken to reassure  Mr Roberts  and the Barwon Community that non-involved responsible decision-makers will ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and seen to be done in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-71">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that and because of the fact that the Bill as drafted is not capable of coping with all the irregularities which were brought to attention by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, the Opposition will be moving to widen the terms of the Bill to provide against further abuses such as those outlined in the interim report which we will be discussing at the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>I hope that the Minister will carefully watch the operation of the Act in regard to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of a particular area, say the Northern Territory, issuing a warrant relating to the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></li>
