<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that with the co-operation of the Minister the <span class="highlight">justice</span> we seek will now be found in this legislation and any offender who would do damage to an aircraft or its passengers will be punished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the numerous suggestions emanating from Government senators on how the trade unions should operate in accordance with the principles of elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the national interest, how does he reconcile those objectives with the type of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> that exists iu the commercial world, as exemplified by last Friday’s meeting of Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd at which the majority of Australian resident shareholders who sought to slop this industrial giant ravishing the Colong Caves region of New South Wales were crushed by a large group of overseas shareholders who regard Australia as only a mineral harlot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate select committee that unanimously recommended that the payment to patients in Queensland public hospitals should be $2 a day, in all <span class="highlight">justice</span> I cannot now oppose that recommendation to which I was a party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this recommendation and that there is unfair discrimination against the people of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that their expertise and their knowledge of professional practices and the circumstances would constitute a far more effective tribunal to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the assessment of fees than a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I make the suggestion, so it will go in the record, that this would not necessarily do <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it may well produce an injustice because commonly one expects that in these cases there will be a reduction in the earning capacity and that there is then a reduction in the capacity to work long hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply to deduct overtime earnings from the preinjury earnings as well as the post-injury earnings may well do a very great injustice and I think would almost always result in an assessment which is not fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the future welfare of the children will be belter served by residence in Australia, no matter what sin one of the parents has committed, will the Minister temper <span class="highlight">justice</span> with mercy and withdraw the deportation order? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no fear whatsoever that the contractor in this case will not meet all the obligations of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> that are awarded by industrial tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that all other parties will take the determinations of those tribunals as the criteria of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask: If a wage increase is awarded by the courts, will the contract be adjusted to ensure that the men working on the project will secure wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, thereby guaranteeing continuity of employment and the building of the runway free of the worry that proper adjustments of wages will not be made by the employers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background to the inquiry of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers is fully dealt with in the joint statement of the Attorney-General and myself of the 21st September 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the fees of hospital fund members are to be increased, will consideration be given to ensure that people who have made no claim on such funds over a long period are not denied the economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> which subscribers to the Hospitals Contribution Fund suffered recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Lieutenant Calley, the mass murderer of helpless Vietnamese, being removed from prison and  treated  like a hero while decent young Australians - Geoff Mullen and Charles Martin - are in Australian prisons for refusing to bc involved in this filthy war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 2,000 years ago Christ died so that men may live, yet we have a heretic in this chamber who is repudiating all Christian principles and advocating kilting, all in the cause of so-called <span class="highlight">justice</span> or freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a newspaper report only yesterday  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki concluded hearing an application for a certificate which will enable the matter to be referred to the Commonwealth Industrial Court for the imposition of sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In earlier legislation relating to similar Bills the Parliament debated certain causes which called into question matters of ‘law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no doubt about your sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play, or your capacity and ability, to discharge your duties with the utmost satisfaction to honourable senators and with credit to yourself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of a judgment given yesterday in the Northern Territory by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster relating to the constitutional powers of parliamentary committees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Has he now had an opportunity to read the judgment that was given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster in the Northern Territory Supreme Court last Monday relating to an interpretation of the powers of the Northern Territory Legislative Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had an opportunity to read the judgment that was given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory on Monday of this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister tell us where there is even-handedness and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the situation whereby the Government fails to do anything effective to oppose price increases, such as those imposed by Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, and yet intervenes actively in cases in which the unions seek wage increases because the real value of wages is being eroded by the price increases which the Government fails to do anything about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Laws and regulations are made to ensure that airmen have the right to certain procedures in order to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but in such an organised Service it is often impossible to implement those procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not forgotten that the Government declined to accept the decision of the same arbitrator,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, in regard to salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a most important departure from what was done in regard to the last matter on which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr arbirated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In earlier legislation relating to similar Bills, the Parliament debated certain clauses concerning matters of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned to ensure the effective operation of the Medical Benefits Scheme based on most common fees and has recently appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason to determine, for the purposes of the Scheme, fair and reasonable fees for general practitioner surgery consultations and home visits in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has already been announced, if, after implementation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I table the report by the honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Norman Jenkyn on the operation of the English Divorce Reform Act 1969 and I seek leave to make a statement in connection therewith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J call  Senator Greenwood,  one time Associate to the late Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the AttorneyGeneral seen the statements attributed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox about the urgent need for a major overhaul of the criminal law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware from Press reports only of the decision which was made yesterday by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make the observation that honourable senators do themselves less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> and put themselves in offence against the Standing Orders when they quote from a newspaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  I  pointed out, there is an old adage in jurisprudence which should be well known to  Senator Byrne,  namely: ‘<span class="highlight">Justice</span> must not only be done it must also appear to be done’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will it, as a matter of urgency and in the interests of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, establish a public inquiry to ascertain all information relevant to the execution of the 3 former Croats and their notified punishment by the Communists in Yugoslavia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The questions are not likely to prejudice the Australian case before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> because 1 do not propose to answer them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - I inform the Senate that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise  (Senator Murphy)  left Australia on Sunday, 13 th May, to present Australia’s case against French nuclear testing in the Pacific to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, the Chinese Government does not recognise the jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government, in the light of its proposal to refer the question of French nuclear testing in the Pacific to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, also be prepared to do likewise on the question of nuclear testing by Communist China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) is an effort by the Government to bring some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> into the inequitable electoral laws which apply today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the ludicrous situation that has been exposed again by the results of the Victorian State elections, where the Victorian Liberal Government had 46 members elected to the State Parliament by 42 per cent of the vote, whereas 42 per cent of voters supporting the Australian Labor Party enabled that Party to obtain only 18 or 19 seats, will the Minister consider having a White Paper issued by the Commonwealth Electoral Office to point out the grave inequity of the Victorian Electoral distribution and so inform the people of Victoria and the rest of Australia of facts that the Australian Press has suppressed of a cynical, opportunistic, perversion of democratic electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I lay upon the table a statement made by me to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in The Hague on 23 May 1973 in connection with the report of a meeting between Australian and French scientists in Canberra from 7 to 9 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the smaller States who depend upon that one plank of power against the larger States of the Commonwealth for exertion of our rights of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be recreant to our faith to pass over the balance of power in this place to what is a segment of New South Wales, now greatly inflated and enriched by its unique proximity to the Federal Government and with all the advantages of enrichment that we have seen over recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the estimated cost of the current appeal to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of Honourable senators I present the report on restructuring the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system in the Northern Territory dated 20 July 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that I have to inform the Senate of the death this morning of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Walsh of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to say that, of course,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby was not a judge and therefore it did not apply to him as a matter of strict equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It received very intense consideration by the Constitutional Review Committee from 1956 to 1959 when I endeavoured to have established what I think would be the system advocated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon- that is to say, the unitary system, ignoring the division between State and Federal jurisdictions, and having one system of judges to administer the law whether it be State or Federal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may say, however, that it is a well-established rule of law that the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> require that a person adjudicating on a dispute between parties should not himself have an interest in the subject matter of the dispute, or to have otherwise been personally involved in the matter under dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate would know, even if not all members are aware of it, in considering whether to take action as Attorney-General one considers what will be the effect generally upon the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and whether it is to the public advantage to take such action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, a Governor-General on retirement will be eligible for a pension equivalent to that payable from time to time under the appropriate legislation to a retired Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the AttorneyGeneral’s remarks in the Senate on 27 October that he would make sure that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is aware of the situation, I ask: Has he performed that undertaking and is he now in a position to say when the High Court judgment is likely to be handed down? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>106-109 of the official transcript), which implied that the terms of reference restricted the Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry to the environmental aspects of making a decision; and (b) did the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> also state that it would be an impertinence for the Commission to make any recommendation as to whether or not export permits should be granted or whether or not mining should proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will ASIO discontinue the use of State Police for security information purposes, in view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s opinion, expressed in paragraph 1 8 of the Second Report of the Royal Commission on Security and Intelligence, that he was not attracted by submissions that the tasks of ASIO, or parts of the tasks, could be left to bodies such as police forces of the States, and his further statement that serious questions of civil liberties could arise if any ‘secret police’ organisations were instituted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister announced on 23 February 1978 the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to undertake a review of the whole area of protective security in Australia and this will include discussions with State Governments on Commonwealth/State liaison arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor’s report, including findings as to the meaning of impropriety, been accepted by the Government in totality, in view of the Prime Minister’s statement on 8 August 1978, that: ‘We (that is, senior Ministers) were of the view that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor’s report had to be accepted. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is this a fact and does the Minister agree that the basic rule of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to obtain evidence first and then make the necessary arrests later? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of a question recently we elicited from the Attorney-General information that the man appointed to head the royal commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, was a man who could receive a benefit of many thousands of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They threaten confrontation over what they see as some form of injustice in the socalled penal provisions in legislation, which has been enacted by universally and freely elected governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that it is used in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me read the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey which was handed down in Alice Springs at 2.30 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, it has always been the policy of the Government that this should be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister not agree that if any persons who were guilty of these most monstrous crimes were to escape <span class="highlight">justice</span> on the grounds of such a technical reason as the statute of limitations, this would be an affront to the conscience of civilised people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1236, which indicates that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done- at least half way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh engaged in some political comment and denigration about the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that is hardly worthy of comment when one compares the status of the shadow Minister for Primary Industry with the most elevated status of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose if we were to speak of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as having some political taint we would not need to go very far- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the second reading debate I indicated the Opposition’s concern that this appointment is floating not only in the sense that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox seems to be floating around the world but also in the sense of the uncertainty in relation to the duration of the appointment and in relation to extensions which might be made to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has not succeeded by that time in achieving some of the Government’s stated intentions in relation to this matter then a full explanation should be given to the Parliament and an effort should be made either to amend this legislation again or to introduce new legislation to cover any further appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I simply point out that the purpose of this legislation is not to authorise the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, which I think was in October 1977, was contemplated for a period of 12 months or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I ask the AttorneyGeneral on how many occasions  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has had his appointment extended to this date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister not agree that if any persons who were guilty of these monstrous crimes were to escape <span class="highlight">justice</span> on the grounds of such a technical reason as the statute of limitations, this would be an affront to the conscience of civilised people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-68-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, on 2 January 1 979, the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, was officially informed that Australia hoped some means could be found to ensure that former war criminals would not be permitted to escape <span class="highlight">justice</span> simply because of a lapse of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-68-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am always annoyed when I hear Government senators severely criticising trade unionists for going on strike to get some <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as the very same senators who are so vocal and critical of the trade union movement were quite happy to go on strike in the Parliament and hold up a duly elected government, a government that had been elected twice within three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the Whitlam government, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron was appointed to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and Chief Judge Elizabeth Evatt to the Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the present government, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Kemeri Murray, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Margaret Lusink and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Josephine Maxwell have been appointed to the Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is completely different from the statements that have been made by the former  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, who has gone on record as saying that in his opinion the Government was trying to tell the Commission how to conduct its business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby seems to be in line with the statement made by the Minister during the course of his second reading reply that with the exception of deregistration - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman,  at the time you rose to your feet I was saying that in the opinion of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby by these provisions the Government was trying to tell the Commission how to conduct its business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby said that the legislation was setting out to destroy the independence of the Commission and that as far as he was concerned it was probably unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did it do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Government’s position or to the committees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have some information on that matter, I think that to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the question asked by the honourable senator I should get a proper reply from the Minister for Transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Commissioner of Taxation instituted any inquiries into the tax liabilities of any individual mentioned in evidence at the New South Wales Royal Commission into Drugs, chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, or mentioned in comments by Counsel assisting the Commissioner,  Mr Fisher,  Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister have an inquiry instituted and a report made to the Senate on the erosion of human rights which was observed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court when he said that the appeal of Marrilyn Lee Sernach had brought to light a rather unhappy and unedifying situation in which an instruction to the Australian Capital Territory police force as to when fingerprints were to be taken was unlawful? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It so happens that I read the report which appeared in this morning’s ‘Canberra Times’ of the remarks of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 have perused the report only once, and although I have it in my hand I could not pretend to do full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to it in relation to all the scientific theories that it has examined, but it is not within my memory that that specific theory has been put forward as a hypothesis to explain the plague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we have heard reference to the report of the Committee headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, never once have we heard the Minister for Health  (Dr Forbes)  or the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  mention the report of the Senate Select Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government reluctantly was forced to accept most of the recommendations contained in the report presented by the Committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go all the way wilh the honourable senator in saying that the practice of holding court proceedings, especially court proceedings involving charges involving penalties, is a cherished fundamental of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which there are some special exceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I, as one interested in reform and in trying to restore some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Aboriginal people of this country, to give them opportunities to share in the affluence of our society, might differ to some extent with the methods that have been adopted by the Government, I would never go so far as to say that its intentions were not sincere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only remedy available to the business people in those seaside resorts w ho would stand to lose - the operators of hotels, motels, guest houses and flats, and the people who provide meals and those who run the other businesses which cater for the large number of people at those resorts - would be to sue individually the owner of the ship at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee consists of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, as  Chairman, Mr J.  M. Rodd, a Melbourne solicitor and  Mr P.  C. E. Cox, a Sydney accountant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I don’t imagine I shall ever be able to do anything in this matter as a personal action against the directors of Poseidon would be very dangerous and costly - but I feel incensed that no one raises their voice against this apparent lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that such actions which I regard as blatantly criminal are permitted to continue - actions where directors can get away with dishonest statements to the detriment of their shareholders while they themselves are feathering their own nests to the tune of millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to have the historical and developmental story of this matter before us, let us remind ourselves that in the Australian scene the Company Law Advisory Committee presided over by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, whose experience in this field is very special, issued a report in October 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this idea of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s committee of a single companies commission the Standing Committee of AttorneysGeneral developed studies as to whether or not the American Securities and Exchange Commission had elements that should be adopted in the Australian scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commission that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s committee recommended had for its primary purpose something altogether different from the American Securities and Exchange Commission, namely, that in special cases in which companies were embarrassed by the comprehensive nature of the legislative provisions as to accounts and filling in forms the commission should exercise the function of granting exemptions to them from the statutory requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston is the  chairman  and  Mr Cox,  who is a Sydney accountant, and  Mr Rodd,  who is a Melbourne solicitor, are members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If solicitors sent circulars to clients or to prospective clients informing them that they would not act for them unless the minimum costs to be received were 1,000, that would mean that the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would become a complete mockery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If my objection was valid enough to justify an amendment and the amendment has not covered the objection and in fact has done nothing to meet the objection but has merely limited the occasions on which the principles of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> may operate, then the Minister has failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all trying to reach a point at which there is a balance between <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the persons charged and the necessity to ensure that there is no undue impediment to bringing them to trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is inherent in the British system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that 9 guilty persons may go free rather than 1 innocent person be convicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is, therefore, confined to proceedings for offences under the Crimes (Aircraft) Act, and provides expressly that a magistrate or court shall not admit documents of the type we are discussing where it appears in all the circumstances it would be contrary to the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that if the occasion arises for the application of this provision, a court will faithfully observe the traditional concepts of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and ensure that a trial or committal proceeding is conducted in a manner which is scrupulously fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the circumstances, therefore, it appears to me proper that such matters should be left to the determination of courts whose function it is, in our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to determine these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proceedings under the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963 the magistrate or court hearing die proceedings shall not admit in evidence a document referred to in the last preceding sub-section, or a part of such a document, unless it appears to the magistrate or court that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be contrary to the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> not to do so.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I equally shared the concern which both  Senator Cavanagh  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy)  expressed that it should not be mandatory upon the court to accept this evidence and to give it an undue weight; that <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be denied in cases where an individual would be under hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could visualise that the only circumstances in which it would  be  contrary to the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> not to do so would be where, by withholding the document, an individual was to  be  prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that when one looks at it in the sense in which  Senator Byrne  has mentioned that would be a fair rendering of the words, but I sense that when one comes to construe them in the way - as he would appreciate - in which courts are inclined to construe them what is contrary to the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is looked at, as properly it should be looked at, from the viewpoint of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have the very strong feeling that the rendering of these words, if they ever should be called upon to be rendered by a court, would be that this document shall not be admissible unless having regard to all the circumstances it would be contrary to the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> not to admit it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the provision stands now the court would be faced with the evidence and would have to say: ‘We will not admit this evidence unless you can show us that it would be against <span class="highlight">justice</span> not to admit it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be contrary to the ordinarily accepted notions of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tribunal says: ‘I will not admit it unless it appears to me that it would be contrary to the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> not to admit it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prosecution perhaps could satisfy the tribunal that it would be unjust not to admit the evidence, that it would go against the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we must not forget the question of community rights and that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all, not only to an accused person but also to people who have been injured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that  Senator McClelland,  who knows the area concerned very well, would agree with me that if a levy of a few cents was imposed on every barrel of oil that came into or went out of Kurnell there would be a fund from which people with claims could receive economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a desire to ensure that not only is <span class="highlight">justice</span> done but also that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is seen to be done, will the Attorney-General see to it that charges arising out of the demonstrations relating to the Vietnam war and the National Service Act, controversial political questions, will not be heard by a magistrate with  politicaparty  membership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my association with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and various trade unions I cannot remember an occasion when a union has threatened industrial trouble because it was dissatisfied with the salary being paid to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby or  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as 1 said before, I believe that there is a point of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition I move the request for this amendment in the hope that it will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a large number of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these facts I oppose the amendment and urge the Committee not to be governed by emotional issues but rather to seek a solution to a complex problem which will give satisfaction and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been impressed by the strength and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of their case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Labor movement believes in a fair economic return to all sections of the community, and that as a matter of common <span class="highlight">justice</span> this amendment should be carried by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend that if the Commonwealth has those powers it has power to ensure that the people on Moa or Banks Island receive the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which they are rightly entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that in <span class="highlight">justice</span> this ought to be cleared up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen recent reports of a statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations advocating the establishment of a permanent United Nations police force to enforce orders of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and generally to enable the United Nations to become more effective as a peace and law keeping body? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that because this is recognised by the Government under section 37 if the doctor, in connection with the disallowance of a claim, thinks that there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, this could quite easily be overcome by a right of appeal to a Supreme Court being vested in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that this amendment be carried and I have therefore moved it on behalf of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reference is made to a judge of the court, but 1 think that that expression would be construed to apply to the person who is exercising the function - a <span class="highlight">justice</span>, judge or magistrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These statements by the Minister are strong reasons why perhaps, on a very rare occasion, a doctor might feel that a great injustice has been done to him and therefore he should have the right of appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe it is an important matter of principle and an important matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section which is proposed by the Government says that if be grants the application he shall register the organisation accordingly and what one has therefore is an application accepted and a registration made, and an organisation is registered subject to such conditions as the Minister determines.I would have thought that that situation, even if it is called an administrative act, has with it all the elements which can work <span class="highlight">justice</span> or injustice according to the way the Minister looks at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this Government’s policies when people at the bottom of the scale, like the transport workers, have to go on strike to get a few dollars more to meet additional commitments caused by inflationary factors outside their control such as increased interest on repayments of home loans and hire purchase? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston who, with 2 assessors, Professor D. P. Derham, C.M.G., M.B.E., and  Mr M.  C. Timbs, was appointed in March 1970 to advise the Government on the levels of academic salaries that might now be used by the Australian Universities Commission for the purpose of recommending grants for the recurrent expenditure of the universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Eggleston submitted his report on 7th May 1970 and his main recommendations are that the salaries for professors should be increased from $ 1 2,000 per annum to $14,400 per annum, an increase of 20%, and salaries for readers and associate professors should be increased by a like percentage from $9,900 per annum to $11,880 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Eggleston also recommends that in future there should be automatic adjustments in academic salaries following national wage case decisions and states that the percentage increases recommended in the report are calculated on the assumption that automatic adjustments will be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations are in keeping with recent changes in salary rates payable to other categories of workers with which it is appropriate to compare academic salaries in universities and the Government has decided that it will contribute its normal share of any increases approved by the State governments up to the limits proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, with effect from 1st January 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Premiers and State Ministers for Education have received copies of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s report and have been informed of the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for each State government to decide whether it will support the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston makes certain suggestions about the manner in which future inquiries should be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the subject, and is inappropriate and inopportune in view of the business we have on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will she request the Postmaster-General, on behalf of the postal clerks and telegraphists throughout Australia, to accept the principle  of  a 5-day working week, which has become accepted in so many industries and establishments throughout the nation, thereby doing something positive towards giving these employees <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister draw the Postmaster-General’s attention to the fact that the policy of treating them as second class employees by denying them the rights and justices to which they are entitled will result in further discontent and disruption in post offices throughout the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I heard  Senator McClelland’s  speech 1 thought he did less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> in referring to the degree to which the Government had accepted the Council’s general concept on this matter and, indeed, the interim report by the film committee of the Australian Council for the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is that what it thinks is social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, or ought it not direct its action into areas where it really thinks the economy ought to be dampened? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Senate to the amendments to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Bill which we discussed today and to other amendments is that one must always have access to law, if necessary, for the purpose of obtaining <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should make a determination, not only by ourselves, as to the provision of resources and facilities: we should have the assistance of others who are expert in these matters when it comes to a general reconsideration of salaries and allowances, so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be done to members of the Parliament and to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is just as much <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their having an allowance as there is in heads of departments and Service chiefs receiving one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we ought to have is a consideration of these matters in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and in fairness, lt is not right for the Government to just brush these matters away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remarks that I have made about the need for faim ss and <span class="highlight">justice</span> apply equally well to members in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I too commend the Government for having seen the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the proposed amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could not see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of discriminating against hospitals and paying them only 80 cents per patient per day as against the $2 per patient per day that was being paid to public hospitals in other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of a recent statement by the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, advocating the establishment of a permanent United Nations police force  to  enforce orders of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and generally to enable the United Nations to become more effective as a peace keeping and law enforcing body does the Australian Government support the general principle of the establishment of such a police force and, if so, will Australia contribute personnel to such a force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that the interests of appellants are met by the present arrangements under a system which requires the determining authorities namely the Repatriation Boards, the Repatriation Commission and the Entitlement and Assessment Appeal Tribunals to determine claims and appeals according io substantial <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the merits of the case and not be bound by technicalities or legal forms’, lt may be of interest to the honourable senator lo know that ex-servicemeu’s organisations have not, in general, favoured legal representation before Tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance we believe that, despite the claim of the Minister that the expense and delay of an appeal is not warranted, a matter of principle and elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> is involved here and that any person is entitled to appeal against an arbitrary decision of a Minister when that Minister has a discretionary power vested in him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why in <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not that provision remain in the Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> does the Government think can be achieved by setting these things up within the hands of the brokers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in its wisdom, should do all in its power in framing the Budget to see that these youngsters get some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have asked that it be referred to one of the newly appointed standing committees so that a proper investigation, in appropriate circumstances, can be carried out to see whether <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be granted in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True it would need the approval of this Parliament but I do not think that a fair measure redressing the injustices of the past would find any difficulty in obtaining the approval of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had thought that the Commonwealth was trying to write some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> into the Schedule whereas it becomes perfectly obvious that it is quite prepared to collect the excise on cigarettes and beer, the sales tax that is paid upon school requisites and the turnover tax as well on behalf of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But unfortunately in recent years he has found that it takes a very long time to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the arbitration court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood  mentioned earlier tonight that the action adopted by the unions in taking direct action is not the proper approach for getting industrial wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me give 2 examples out of the hundreds that there are where trade union organisations would not have received <span class="highlight">justice</span> without taking industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is great acclamation in the chamber that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been granted on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why, in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, should the fines and costs against that trade union continue to stand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These so-called former Labor men have no desire to see <span class="highlight">justice</span> granted to those people who have to earn their living with their muscles and their brains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Legislation is introduced and then a change is made and we think that everything will be all right and how well off we will be; we think there will be peace and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and there will not be any abuse of the provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bodies concerned with this legislation are principally public bodies - trade unions and organisations of employers - created, as was said by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs in the Australian Shipbuilding Board case, for great public purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the things the Australian Labor Party has been complaining about - The inability of various sectors of industry to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arbitration system awards can be obtained without any conflict, but over award payments are necessary if the workers are to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> om of their contribution  io  industry and they find it necessary to take industrial action to achieve this <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the workers seek to exert their rights and to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> the penal clauses in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are invoked by the employing class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were lo be the practice and principle for some reason good and sufficient that the nominees of these gentlemen should be there, I can see no logical reason or no reasion in <span class="highlight">justice</span> why the leader of the second nongovernment party should not be on the committee if that principle is adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My interpretation is that this as a safeguard to ensure that some <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to the independent member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For each of the years 1968 and 1969, what percentage of cases (a) before a single <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and (b) in the Full Court, of the High Court of Australia, has originated in each of the Slates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major part of that time was devoted to reading to the Senate extracts from statements made by the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,  Mr Hawke,  when he declared that the trade union movement would strongly resist efforts by employers to use arguments on the cost price squeeze to stop workers getting wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In typical fashion and according to conservative thinking the Minister seemed to adopt the attitude that when something goes wrong with one section of the community or some economic area the blame has to be cast on the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the working class generally because of their attempts to get wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is the man who has to see that the workers get <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their wages and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were breaks in the sittings and other difficulties which confronted the Committee in its very intense desire to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to give full and complete consideration to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The old case of Dignan, reported in 46 Commonwealth Law Reports, has, in the judgments at least of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, as he then was before becoming Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of’ the High Court of Australia, and of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich, passages that suggest that ceasing to have effect under the Acts Interpretation Act would have the same effect as formerly  -  I stress the word ‘formerly’ - the repeal of a statute would have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him: Under what authority was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers appointed to conduct an inquiry into whether or not Brian Ross, at present in Sale gaol, holds conscientious objections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 cannot believe that any honourable senator in this chamber would think that, he could do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a study of that subject and the delivery of a responsible report upon it after less than 12 months consideration, when it is to be remembered that he must concert his activities with those of his fellow members of the committee and, following joint consideration in the time that is available to the 8 members of the committee, reach a responsible conclusion on such a pervading national subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Government recognise the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of Aboriginals’ claims for land rights, or does it still subscribe to the belief that they are essentially second class citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers may be, will the Minister inform this imprisoned peace advocate that in the Government’s view he is misinformed and his best service to mankind would be to kill, to accept laws which force him to kill, and to support our wrong and cruel invasion of Vietnam and our equally wrong reasons for being there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those whose policy is <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the family man will support that policy with their votes there will be enough votes in the Senate to defeat these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  this community we have workers organised into trade unions which are trying to do their best to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for those workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of doing that, it is much easier, because they are an easy chopping block, to turn around and attack the trade union leaders and to say that they are terrible men, when they are trying to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for their own members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators may have noticed recently that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, who did a very important job for the Government recently, said he was shocked and appalled because he had come to the opinion that there were 1 million people on the poverty line in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware that at a ladies Liberal Party meeting this week <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Roma Mitchell, Australia’s only female judge and a most distinguished feminist, warned that because of the continual increase in the cost of living all women in the very near future would have to .work to provide a second income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the Government Whip presented a petition which fully expressed the terms of the resolution carried by the Young Liberal League in South Australia, that the Budget does not give satisfaction and fails to provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> for Australian pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ACTU places as much importance on this Budget us  it  does upon an application to an arbitration court which seeks wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> or a fair  share  of the wealth which its members help to produce in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as the Government has failed lamentably in this direction, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission now finds it necessary in order to give wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to enter a field which should be a matter for government - that is, a consideration of the profitability of industry and the placing of some of the profitability of industry in the hands of those who create the profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what the final outcome was but I understand that the parties fronted up to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher and it is possible that the insurance company was told to be a little more patient in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>[t is gratifying, at least to the people of South Australia, to know that even though they cannot get <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the Commonwealth Government the Grants Commission has seen the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this country is to progress and if we are to have any kind of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, then this destructive Budget ought to be defeated in this place and in the other place also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I look closely at the Budget Papers presented by the present Treasurer, I see in them no evidence that this Government believes in social <span class="highlight">justice</span> or that it is prepared to face up to the need for social reform in our society of the 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, who was appointed by the Government to preside over an interdepartmental committee to inquire into voluntary health insurance in Australia, said a month or two ago that the evidence presented before him in that inquiry showed that at least 1 million Australians are living not only below the poverty line in Australia, but miserably below it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo said that about 1 million Australians are living miserably below the poverty line in this country: that is to say, about I. in 12 Australians, or about  8i  per cent of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In March, at the time the Minister for the Army on behalf of the Prime Minister rejected the request of the pensioners,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston was appointed to inquire into the salaries of academics throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston recommended that in order to keep pace with the cost of living that had taken place in the community, an increase of 20 per cent in salaries should be awarded to professors and a 17 per cent increase should be awarded to lecturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might give some indication of the manner in which  Mr Gregory  conducts himself if I were to refer to part of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hugo Black of the United States Supreme Court, which was delivered on 10th March 1969. lt refers to the episodes which took place in Chicago at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know I cannot convince him because he has been so long in the cut and thrust of politics and has for so long determined his own policy that he is unconcerned about principles, rights and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, believing that the only proper principles, rights and <span class="highlight">justice</span> are those of  Senator Turnbull. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> should have been applied in the granting of taxation relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it is too much to expect of this Government that it should apply the ordinary rule of <span class="highlight">justice</span> when it comes to providing for the needs of the ordinary people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I spoke a long while ago -  I  think 3 years ago - on my personal belief that the time had come for a study of direct and indirect rates and that there was some <span class="highlight">justice</span> in following the more advanced countries of Europe and the United Kingdom in looking at the indirect tax scale because it provided an opportunity for the taxation burden to be shared more equitably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this is a matter of importance to the local community and deserving of a very close investigation in the shortest possible time so that some sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is given to the local population, and so that departmental officers, members of Parlia ment and others will be able to go about their jobs with the speed and efficiency to which they should be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are entitled to <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but get none; they are entitled to security, but get none. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is reasonable to assume from that statement that  Senator Murphy  was saying that, were we the Government, we would see that the pensioners- received more <span class="highlight">justice</span> and more security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Nimmo, in opening Salvation Army week last July, pointed out that during the health insurance inquiry of 1968 he had discovered that, apart from pensioners, 250,000 low income families, representing 1 million persons, were living below a miserably low poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Conditions today might cause some union leaders to believe that now is a very propitious time to engage in some alternative scheme, but if the day comes when full employment does not obtain they will seek refuge in the arbitration court where they can hope to receive reasonable <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Could inquiries be made into this matter and could necessary action be taken in order to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I hope the honourable senator will understand, any honourable senator in this chamber representing a Minister is most anxious to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his colleague and to be accurate and fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a suggestion is completely unreal and a procedure of that kind would do scant <span class="highlight">justice</span> to honourablesenators on either side of the chamber, lt is hoped that the establishment of the committee system will enable honourable senators, as committeemen, to seek information on points of detail, information which in the past has been sought during the Estimates debate by the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that one of the most effective testimonials that could be directed to the Committee was given at a public meeting held at the Sydney Town Hall at 8 p.m. on 27 August under the chairmanship of  Sir Garfield  Barwick, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court and  Chairman  of the Australian Conservation Foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers commence hear-  ing the case of Brian Ross 3 days before the regulations were gazetted and came into operation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is the fact - a fact which has escaped my scrutiny - that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers was invited to undertake an inquiry 3 days before the actual publication of the statutory rules, that would indicate to me only the eagerness of the Minister to have the earliest judicial determination which a judge could give, strictly in accordance with court process, on whether this man who was lingering in prison for some 11 months was  considerd by the judge to be a conscientious objector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had therefore been arranged for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, to determine whether in fact the defendant held those beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers make any finding in the case of Brian Ross as to whether a question had arisen, as defined by legal interpretation and as required under the amended regulations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I explained that the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers could not be made pursuant to the regulations because the person to whom the inquiry related had been convicted and imprisoned for some months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the point of whether a question had arisen as to whether the man is a conscientious objector was not relevant to the process pursued by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers be made available to honourable senators? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in answer to the only part of the honourable senator’s question which I think it appropriate to answer at this stage I say that the report of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers was attached to the statement of the Minister that was made public in recent days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the State parliaments should determine issues of this nature if there is no comparable wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> or there are no comparable payments between one State and another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is not prepared to support the proposal of  Senator Gair  for the setting up of an independent tribunal because it would mean that the pensioners would be delayed in receiving the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the discretion is applied in such a way that a wealthy company is deprived of some entitlement, the company takes the matter to the High Court and sometimes as far as the Privy Council for a determination of the question in order to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> under a particular Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that in the immediate term what the Returned Services League and the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association have asked for is good enough to give rough <span class="highlight">justice</span>; that is, to use the 1950 review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government did that on every occasion and restored the relativity of the pensions, at least it would be conferring progressive <span class="highlight">justice</span> on the people who should receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the references that have been made to a learned professor and other liberal - with a small T - minded persons who have called for an investigation into the allegations against the police, and in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those gentlemen will the Minister take notice that they did not call merely for an inquiry in regard to the police, they called also for an inquiry simultaneously into the political influences behind the Moratorium which caused the trouble? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: As the activities of the Moratorium last Friday have given rise to charges and counter charges and the South Australian Government is seeking to institute an impartial inquiry into activities in South Australia, will the Commonwealth assist the South Australian Royal Commission - the Royal Commissioner is a learned <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the South Australian Supreme Court and he is assisted by an accepted Queen’s Counsel from Victoria - to examine all the evidence and come to a proper decision by making available to the Royal Commission officers of the Commonwealth Police Force and members of the Commonwealth Security Service who were in Adelaide at the time witnessing the demonstration, as well as films and photographs taken of the activities in Adelaide last Friday by members of the Security Service and Commonwealth Police Force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will not cost the country a fortune, but it will give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those people who most need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are so restrictive that in the opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, whose views I have quoted, they would prevent the law being applied in other territories of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have only people in public office who can speak on their behalf and the responsibility comes right back to the Minister and the Department to see that some sort of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> is granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation was confirmed by inquiries made under the direction of  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who was then the AttorneyGeneral and is now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know,  Sir Garfield  Barwick went off to the High Court and became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While workers are trying to get some industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  addressing a dinner at which the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was present, warned the Commission that the economy could not stand wage rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, as an industrialist and a former trade union official, appreciate that there are times and circumstances in which labour may be forced to deny management its services in order to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those spokesmen are denying that which the Federal Conference acknowledges and on that aspect acknowledges one must say, with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that this matter will be investigated again by the appropriate department and that, even after these years, this man will be given the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which he is entitled as a former member of the Services and to which he as an Australian is entitled to receive from an Australian government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the greater part of the expenses of persons who are seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the courts is the cost of barristers and solicitors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same Board administers <span class="highlight">justice</span> to ensure proper discipline and proper conduct within the profession whether one practices as a barrister, or a solicitor and whether or not one is a member of a firm and one member of the firm is actually practising as an advocate and the other member is practising as a solicitor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had recourse to a book  by  the late  Sir Arthur  Dean, who was for many years a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I particularly respect  Senator Greenwood’s  comments and his references to the history of the Victorian bar made by the former  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been argued - I think with some <span class="highlight">justice</span> - that if a person does not wish to exercise the present rights he has under the National Service Act for classification as a conscientious objector, and if he is prepared to take the consequences which follow for a person who refuses to comply with the Act, he should be entitled to refuse to comply with the Act subject to his taking the consequences of that refusal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the request of the Minister  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers held an inquiry into Ross at the Sale Gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By ignoring the public trial, sitting privately in chambers and having a conversation with Brian Ross and his parents  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers came to the belief that Ross had a conscientious objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate additional grants to meet the Commonwealth’s contribution to the costs of the new levels of academic salaries in universities that the Government agreed to support from 1st January 1970, in accordance with recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amounts are also in line with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who say this should read the report of a royal commission which was conducted in New South Wales by  Mr <span class="highlight">justice</span>  Cook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few years ago woo) growers were told by the inquiry into the industry, chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cook in New South Wales that those who were selling wool at auction were, to use a phrase of the man in the street, putting it over the wool grower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore 1 think that not only in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian Wool Commission but also in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness to the Minister the word ‘Commission’ should be deleted and the word Minister’ inserted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, who headed the Government Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance, came to the conclusion - I think everyone will recall his statement, which was widely publicised - that 1 million Australians were living below a miserably low poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Fund continues to deny this opportunity, especially when there is a surplus, then I say that it is denying <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the public servants and denying a service which all insurance companies supply to their clients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in any of these areas: Firstly, the non-disclosure of investments; secondly, the non-availability of loans for home building purposes, and thirdly, the discrimination against dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, it will be headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, who is a judge of the Supreme Court of the A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo conducted an inquiry into the existing health services;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney conducted an inquiry into salaries paid in colleges of advanced education;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston for many years has been connected with the Company Law Review Committee and, as 1 understand it, has not been occupied at all with Industrial Court activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do not have the information which would adequately do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a statement of either case and thereforeI do not propose to discuss them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to go back to May this year and by way of explanation refer to an article headed ‘Black <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’ written by  Mr James  Hall in the ‘Bulletin’ on 26th September 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the Government has forgotten that in introducing a Public Order Bill it is necessary to consider the <span class="highlight">justice</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the life of me I cannot see how an Act which enables police to apprehend without real cause - as appears to be so in New Guinea - has any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has failed to impress me as an Act with any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in it when it is possible for Administration officers in New Guinea to expel or exile a man from a town or prevent a man from entering a town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot for the life of me see any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Administration officers in New Guinea having power to disband political meetings and declare them illegal without reference to the normal procedures of law as they exist on the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to point out in good faith errors or defects - (i) in the government of or the laws in force in the Territory; or (ii) in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, with a view to the reform of those errors or defects; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Opposition are of the opinion that a territory which comes under the supervision of this country should produce some sort of reasonable enactment to achieve the end which the Administration is supposed to be achieving, which is, I would imagine, law and order and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">justice</span> part has been forgotten, as I have indicated previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is in effect saying is that it has no confidence in the magistracy or in the Supreme Court, which are the independent arms of the judiciary emanating from this country as an appropriate place for British <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers, which included details as lo the examination which was conducted into  Mr Brian  Ross’ beliefs was issued with that same statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On being imprisoned for failure to obey  a  notice calling him up for service with the military forces,  Mr Ross  had no further liability for national service.In view of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers the remainder ofthesentence imposed by the court was remitted and he was released. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Colin Tatz, in his article ‘Queensland Aborigines, Natural <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Rule of Law’ (Australian Quarterly, Sept. 1963) quotes many documented cases of breaches of similar regulations in the act then in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The procedure is similar except that the first court of appeal is the District Officer, and the second, the Visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great many people throughout the world and a large number of similar bodies in Australia, particularly those connected with the World Council of Churches and the Catholic Eucumenical Commission on Peace and <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, believe that one of the principal methods of improving the living standards of people is through trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill provides for additional payments to the States in order to provide for increased salaries for academic staff at universities as a result of the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party believes that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s reports obviously would he soundly based, well considered and wise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government which has never been noted in the past for being unduly generous, clearly must also have been compelled by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston’s arguments, otherwise it would not have introduced this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I inferred there was a grudging assent to the levels of remuneration that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston recommended and we approved for the university community of this country: a professor, $14,400; an associate professor, $11,880; a senior lecturer, maximum $10,500; and a lecturer, maximum $8,760, minimum $6,318. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man who puts a long period of his life into an apprenticeship qualifying himself to teach as a lecturer in a university will receive a salary, as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston - this Bill is a recognition and the Commonwealth supports that recommendation - of $6,318 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is a massive advertising campaign being carried out by the Postmaster-General’s Department against its employees, who are seeking wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>; if so, are the expensive advertisements being financed by the Postmaster-General or is the cost being met by the use of taxpayers funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement could be interpreted to mean also that the Government is content to allow the pensioners to live in their stale of penury because the economy might be disturbed by a dispensation of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the aged, the invalid and the widowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969 we had before this chamber the Judiciary Bill by which the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia was increased from 24.000 - a real bread-line salary - to $30,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave me a similar answer in a previous case in which he probably was right, but this case is different, ff he would only emulate the practice of the British Minister and set up an immigration appeal tribunal there would not be the miscarriages of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that have occurred in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Appropriately for a document that proved too hot for the OECD to handle in its original form, the report contained a dire prediction of the social and political consequences of continued inflation: ‘Because resentment against inflation is incoherent and diffused through the community, it provides favourable terrain for extremists at both ends of the political spectrum, lt gives ammunition to those who favour more authoritarian forms of government relying on extensive wage, price, and production controls, and to those who hark back to earlier times before governments had accepted their present responsibilities for growth, high employment, and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent exposition of immorality and drinking on Palm Island is probably true, but is it not more important that we ensure the chance of life for babies on this reserve, and every other reserve in Queensland, and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the adults who, by bureaucratic processes, are refused permission even to visit wives, families and other relatives, sometimes for a period of years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> of India who was in Australia some years ago at a law conference said: ‘Sometimes you need procedural methods in the law under which some individuals will suffer, but these persons are almost sacrifices for the efficient conduct of the law.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tt is a flagrant breach of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that a magistrate is justified in imposing the maximum penalty upon an individual because a person lays a complaint, whether or not he is an officer of the department, and states that to his knowledge this person has not held a licence to operate the radio he has in his residence for the last 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For such people to be convicted and restricted in their right of appeal certainly does not accord with my sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could go along to a court and it would decide whether all the conditions- were satisfied - that he was convicted in his absence, that he did not receive the summons and in effect was deprived of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the point of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as I understand the proposed amendment a defendant has an absolute right lo have the conviction set aside if within 2 years he satisfies the conditions set out in sub-section 4 of proposed section 132a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>agree that every effort should be taken to bring the person responsible to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Manning and from the developments that have taken place, it is obvious that the Act should be amended because most business operations of banks are conducted by cheque now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that there is an abortive effort generally by the law to bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> an individual who issues a worthless cheque - one which at the moment of issue was not in fact backed by any credit whatsoever - because provided the payer cun assert that he expected funds to be available upon presentation of the cheque he can avoid the consequences of legal restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances, as we have expanded the Australian sugar industry following the report some years ago of a committee chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs and as a lot of capital has flowed into the sugar industry, it is most important that by one means or another we retain and expand the present level of production and that we retain the present level of commitment to the industry in personnel, in capital and in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very famous Australian,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell, has taken a great interest in this general question of land tenure, the leasehold system and so on in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell has given a great deal of study and thought to this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that it is an example that should be followed by the rest of Australia, a step which might very well be taken in the future, consistent with recommendations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was decided that these injustices could be avoided only by having a complete look at the present structure of the leasehold system in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another aspect of the matter is this: In this new generation we have militant mothers who want <span class="highlight">justice</span> - not merely on Vietnam - because they feel that there has been a bungling by State authorities on whether enough traffic lights have been provided, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that more power should be given to them to demonstrate because, whether the Government likes it or not, they appear to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> that they would not otherwise have obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring to the law reform concept, I turn to the remarks of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, made in an address to law graduates at the graduation ceremony at Melbourne’s Monash University in May 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is not altogether a fanciful consideration because I think people generally would accept the view that there was a probable miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Timothy Evans case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why I think that probably in the worst of crimes there is a greater danger of a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> than in crimes which are not so dreadful and which can be approached dispassionately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She did not spare herself for one moment and, as a result of the deliberations in which we took part, I came to have the highest personal regard for her and her desire to see the health standards of the Australian community improved.I said in June 1970, which is the last occasion on which this matter was debated before the Senate, that the report - the document which is now known as the senate Select Committee report on Health and Hospital Costs - should be referred to as the Wedgwood report in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the work thatthat senator has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to this matter I would urge the Minister, having regard to the attitude that not only must <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done but <span class="highlight">justice</span> must also appear to be done, to have a look at the composition of these Boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we must be concerned to ensure is that liberty does not degenerate into licence and that the needs of public order, the preservation of the rights of others and the fair and efficient administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall, from time to time, permit actions to be taken which change laws that have their sole justication in their antiquity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted that  Senator Wheeldon  referred to the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black in the case of Gregory v. The City of Chicago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to a greater part of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black said because [ have seldom heard expressed words which more aptly convey what I feel is the thinking of Australians and which is embodied in this Bill than what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black said, whom  Senator Wheeldon  called in aid for his own purposes by extracting one small section of his speech and leaving aside the pith of what a very great man said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sentiments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black are the sentiments of all thinking Australians because what he said reflects the aspirations of those who want to live in peace and yet give to their neighbours the right to do as they please, seeking only that they be left in peace from the excesses of their neighbours’ engagements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have an independent judiciary and a system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which I believe can stand up to scrutiny from anybody anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Minister ensure that the reasonable claims of the Association of Civilian Widows are placed before the Minister for Social Services and Cabinet before the next Budget is decided so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be given to civilian widow pensioners and their children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing this I would like to refer again to the judgment of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black in the case of Gregory v. the City of Chicago which was heard in the Supreme Court of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his reply to the second reading debate yesterday  Senator Greenwood  claimed that I had quoted some of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black’s observations out of context and had in fact given a false picture of the position that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black took on the matter of unlawful assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then proceeded to quote some of the dicta of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black to the effect that one could not allow assemblies to be of such a type whereby people were not able to carry on their normal business and whereby churches were invaded by hordes of people wanting to have meetings while the church services were in progress and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would submit that in fact if one merely looks at this aspect of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black’s judgment in isolation this is taking his words out of context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established the principle that freedom of assembly is guaranteed under the law of the United States, the law then must look at what restrictions must be imposed upon freedom of assembly so that the undesirable consequences, such as those which were referred to in the part of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black’s judgment which were quoted by the Minister could not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black and other members of the Supreme Court of the United States, but in particular  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black, used the phrase ‘meat axe ordinance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister was at pains to claim that in some way I had misrepresented the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black, I would ask him whether he does not agree as a lawyer - not as a member of the Liberal Party or as a Minister - that if  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black, whom he quoted with some reverence last night, was correct in finding that the ordinance of the City of Chicago relating to unlawful assemblies was a meat-axe ordinance, this definition of ‘unreasonable obstruction’ in this Bill is not ever so much more a meat-axe provision than the ordinance of the City of Chicago ever could be upon any construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, he wants to take issue with something which he believes I fairly said last night in regard to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black said in the Supreme Court of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black simply because I thought he gave a very fair statement of the sort of privacy which individuals ought to be entitled to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to hear that  Senator Wheeldon  does agree with what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black said because, as I see it, that is what this Bill is designed to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today  Senator Wheeldon  again quoted what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black said in the case of Gregory v. The City of Chicago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was a vague provision and I think it is fairly entitled to the castigation which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black gave it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not deny that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black used, in a general way, the expression ‘meat axe ordinances’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black because I accept broadly as a principle worthy of emulation what he said and I turn to what this Bill says in the context of what  Senator Wheeldon  has been criticising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point of the definition is, in the language of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black, to narrow what is the conduct with which we are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well understand that, within the terms of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black which has already been referred to, certain provisions have to be made within the framework of a free society allowing free assembly to prevent certain things from taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what we put to the Minister is that once again this is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Black described so unfavourably in his judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Opposition is concerned outside World War T and World War II we have seen many instances where genuine radical causes for <span class="highlight">justice</span> have culminated in some serious conflicts with the law when there was no need for that to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not for me to say whether the courts were sufficiently severe in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That they are bound is in the law books but it is not the standard that prevails under the Anglo Saxon system because that is where the people in the community are involved in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the ACTU and the federal officers of the Federation have done their utmost to ensure that the undertakings which they gave in the proceedings before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore were honoured, I want to make 2 points perfectly clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, if we have gone through so many trials and tribulations and very serious occasions in the history of the Anglo-Saxon people to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>, should we make this an offence even where it has nothing to do with country properties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have been given the assistance of the judgment to which the Minister referred of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr on the word ‘offensive*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that what the Opposition is contending for is a quite unreasonable position which, if it were to be accepted and applied in other areas, would make nonsense of the whole system of administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as there has been a sensible system of administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, not only in Australia but also in England, there have been some offences of a relatively summary or trivial character which have been tried by justices of the peace or in latter days by magistrates, some who are qualified in terms of legal equipment and others who are not, but who in either case have had common sense every day experience of the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be enhanced by demoting and degrading the status of a jury trial to cover all those offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that we must prevent the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> from being clogged completely by vexatious litigants bringing mala fide prosecutions and clogging up the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know the old saying about not only must <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done but it must manifestly appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>There is then the maintenance in the best possible way of the view in the community that an impartial system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the court is put in the position of determining whether the particulars that are supplied are reasonable particulars, I for one believe that the court will do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the defendant by ensuring that he is not prejudiced in regard to what is relevant to the case which is before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo also adverted to the problem of the poverty which exists in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to ensure that we will get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these people and the only way we will shock the Government into a realisation that it may be forced to an election upon this topic is to pass now the amendment I have moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will give the Government formal notice that unless it corrects the difficulties that exist, unless it corrects the social injustices that exist, unless it does right by those persons who are in receipt of social service benefits and unless it carries out the wishes which have been expressed time and again by a majority in the Senate its Budget is going to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) the following words be added:  but the Senate is of the opinion that the social services of the Commonwealth are so inadequate as to constitute social injustice and is of the opinion that, unless the inadequacies are substantially remedied in the Budget, it should be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would point out to the Australian Democratic Labor Party, which agrees that there is social injustice in the community and has been demanding that there should be legislation to overcome this injustice, that now is the time to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate can give notice to the Government before it formulates its Budget that if it does not agree to remedy these injustices the Budget will be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But honourable senators know and the people of Australia will find out that it is not prepared to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done by saying to the Government: ‘We will join with the Australian Labor Party and reject the next Budget unless <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to people in receipt of social services’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My appeal to the Mataungans is to cooperate because the present Administration will not be in power much longer in the Territory, certainly not later than about November 1972, at which stage electoral and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> will come the way of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition everywhere he went was received with open armsand with pleas for political and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we all believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not only be done but must also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this would be a salutory provision because again, whilst it is desired to protect the consumer, there must also be, in the concept of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a fair recognition of the right of the trader who has built up his practice, sometimes with years and years of laborious dedication to his small business which has grown and grown, and he is entitled to the protection of this legislature just as the consumer is entitled to the protection which he will get under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is highly relevant that the debtor made an application to the Court for the deed to be terminated and this application was heard by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Chambers at Launceston on 18th August 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It can only be hoped that for their part as a matter of fairness and common <span class="highlight">justice</span>, some redress will be afforded to  Mr de  Jong and to the officers of the bankruptcy administration, by providing at least equal prominence to this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will see that greater <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done than the Federal Government has given to workers in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that this Bill will be sent back to be re-drafted so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be done to the pupils of Australian State schools, to the parents of pupils of Australian State schools and to Australia, which is sadly lacking in any sound education system at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal and State governments of this country saw the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of spending at least portion of the funds allotted from the public purse for education on children attending private schools only when they were driven to it by sheer necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that would bring a substantial measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to that section of the community, that section of  my Australian brothers and neighbours who have paid their taxes for a lifetime for the education of their children and have then paid out of their own pockets as well for that education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that does not offend the honourable senator’s sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> it offends mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my lifetime in the political movement I have fought for equality of educational <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all school children, and I do not care whether they go to a state school, a private school or any other school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all <span class="highlight">justice</span> let us examine these things carefully, without prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, not recognising the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of all these things, sees some disparity in the division of the $43m over this 4-year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are pleased at the fact that some <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done but I do not want anyone on the Government side to believe that the millenium has been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must develop before we reach the stage where <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be given to workers who compare themselves with workers in industries where the employer has recognised their claim that there should be no monetary loss as a result of an accident suffered while serving the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Possibly it will see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done eventually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Bishop  has said, we think of the industrial relationships, we think of the people; and not only should <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done but <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the results of this legislation, in view of the lack of union representation for those, such as servicemen, who will be covered by it, will be that these matters will come more within the realm of the politician who will have to be the adviser and advocate of those whose injuries are covered by this Bill, in order to sec that some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is meted out to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cannot discuss them they will be swept under the carpet and no <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be obtained by the workers involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition there has been a tremendous amount of propaganda of a political type directed by the trade unions against the Federal Government for its failure to do what is rightly conceived to be social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was in  1904,  when this country, through its legislature, established the means of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> for industrial organisations whether they were employer or employee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that industrial organisations had their being and were created under Austraiian law for the purpose of facilitating their audience before the arbitration commission in order to give them industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here in the Australian Capital Territory a group of most distinguished people, skilled in the fields of law, politics and parliament met under the leadership of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-85-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Evidence Ordinance is an up to date set of rules designed to produce the best possible <span class="highlight">justice</span> under all circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-85-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The names of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason of the New South Wales Court of Appeal have been mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-85-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether his attention has been directed to the reported statement of the New South Wales Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Maddison,  on the need for a critical examination of State laws concerning infringements of the privacy of the individual? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well understand the concern which  Senator Murphy  is experiencing because of the view which he adopted last Thursday in supporting the disallowance of this Ordinance and because of the practical problems in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which that action has caused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should stress that the provision of legal aid is essentially a matter for the State governments because it is in the State arena that most of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 can assure him that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parole Board in New South Wales consists of a judge of the Supreme Court, a judge of the District Court, a person who is the Registrar of the University of Sydney, a retired former UnderSecretary of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Comptroller-General of Prisons, and a businessman who, in this case, happens to be the personnel manager of the Leyland Motors organisation and who also is on the executive of the Prisoners’ Aid Society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, one of the most important considerations, especially in the sphere of criminal law, is that in the eyes of the public at large, and especially of people who fall foul of the criminal law, there should be the appearance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as well as the existence of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator James  McClelland indicated, the Parole of Prisoners Ordinance introduces a desirable and progressive step in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are not obliged to observe what in certain areas would be regarded as the canons of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in what way is the cause of <span class="highlight">justice</span> served by having an inexpert AttorneyGeneral handling the matter instead of an inexpert parole board? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if he will not now give consideration to extending <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who cannot comply with the National Service Act, perhaps tomorrow on reflection after having a rest from his busy day he might adopt some other attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can it be inferred from this rejection that the Government is not interested in <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the pensioners and intends only to continue with minor pension rises if the Australian electors are unfortunate enough to be saddled with the same government by the time of the introduction of next year’s Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee has always shown to this chamber a rather due sense of proportion and a due sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as to what should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It only perpetuates the injustice in the method of last year’s tax reductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year’s increase in the levy only maintains that injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government with a real conviction on social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> - with a realisation of the one million people on the poverty line - would have completely restructured the tax scale so that the upper income earners and the wealthy would pay more and the person on the average wage would pay less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to achieve an equitable tax structure as a basis for economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to change the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not even meet cursorily the need for income <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has denied social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can anyone fairly say in the name of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the extremely wealthy should be subsidised from moneys garnered by taxation imposed on the little people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where is the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not the proper approach to be made by any government aiming at social <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite any honourable senator to stand in his place and challenge us in any respect on any one of those items and say where, with prudence and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, we could have budgeted for a lesser expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These steps are inadequate in terms of the full <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we would desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been saying in this place for years that until pensions and social services are taken out of the field of politics we can never hope to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us get to the point of this motion which, as I have said, has been moved in order to rectify a situation in the Australian Capital Territory, a situation which, unless it is rectified, will play havoc with the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the conduct of criminal trials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By carrying this motion for rescission of the disallowance resolution of last Thursday the Senate will be achieving 2 things: Firstly, it will be indicating that it believes ordinances are an appropriate method for deciding what shall be the manner of enacting laws in this Territory and, secondly, the Senate shall be determining that it shall move an end to the impasse in the Australian Capital Territory forthwith which hitherto, because of the disallowance last Thursday, has prevented the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not wish to seem to be responsible or to be responsible for any breakdown in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also examine whether the enactment of such legislation in Australia would have more beneficial results than the Government’s mad desire at present to penalise workers who find it necessary to take strike action in order to obtain industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due notice having been given, the matter is properly within the forms of the Senate, and if it is proper to be reconsidered natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> may demand that it be reconsidered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To fail, in those circumstances, so to act is a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, in this matter there was a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There having been a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the operations of a tribunal acting judicially, the proceedings, insofar as there has been a denial, should be quashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> was this: When the report was presented to the Senate it was adopted in toto on 13 th May by resolution of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adverse impact of a discretionary decision on the interests of an individual may nevertheless be such that  a  refusal by the courts to insist that he be given an opportunity to be heard may be considered an affront to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision to deport an alien (in respect of which the courts have declined to require observance of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>) probably falls into this category, even though the Home Secretary’s decision may be based on considerations of national security or the maintenance of friendly relations with foreign States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, although it may be inappropriate for the courts to impose procedural duties on a licensing authority exercising a discretion to grant licences, <span class="highlight">justice</span> may call for the imposition of such duties on the same authority before it decides to revoke a licence, especially if the revocation of a licence places a slur on the reputation of the person aggrieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a conflict between two parties, two people -  - a view that may have been based on an oversimplified interpretation of the cases on natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> decided under the Housing and New Towns Acts - overlooked two relevant lines of cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, there arc the cases in which a duty to act judicially in accordance with the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been held to arise by implication from the nature of a power and its impact upon the rights of individuals, despite the absence of any express duty to follow a procedure analogous to the judicial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if the violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> lay in the fact that they had not been given an opportunity after the verdict had been brought in to be heard on the question of punishment or why punishment should not be inflicted upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">justice</span> and one that calls for rectification by the body that was responsible for the imposition of the penalty and the only body that can correct the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person, having been found guilty of an offence, is then denied the opportunity to be heard, does that constitute such a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as to amount to a violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> which requires either a quashing of the conviction or, for that matter, a retrial of the offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authorities are clear and unmistakable that if that right is denied, a violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> has’ occurred which must be rectified through the legal tribunals of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a condign and appropriate step to take, That step, if denied, is considered a violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court, in the case of Coward and Stapleton, did not use the term ‘natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>’, but it quashed the conviction of the person concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of Davies and Griffiths, reported in Kings Bench Division 1937, the court consisting of Lord Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hewart, and Justices Macnaghten and Singleton upheld in substantially the same terms that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of their judgment, the Justices recited what the Justices sitting in original jurisdiction had said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>failure to give counsel for the defend an opportunity to be heard on sentence was, without more, a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that thereby there was at that stage a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the defendant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there is no section of the Justices Act which specifically gives to a defendant the opportunity to be heard upon sentence, but we are led to the firm conclusion that such an opportunity should be given and that if it is not so given then there is a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and the evidence adduced, the said <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or Justices shall consider and determine the whole matter, and convict or make an order upon the defendant or dismiss the information or complaint, as the case may require.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my view that there was clearly a breach of privilege; that the Senate was entitled to deal with the matter; that the offending journalists were dealt with fairly; and that there was no miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Byrne, as a lawyer, should know that the common law doctrine of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> must cede to express provisions in a statute, even if the Parliament were to be regarded as a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would hope though - and I believe - that it has acted according to the laws of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and I would hope that when the Privileges Committee gets down to an examination of its procedures it would spell out all sorts of protection for witnesses who are called before committees and for people in the position of the journalists who were called here on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision states that, on an appeal to a court from the decision in a trial at which the accused person has been found guilty, the appellant may appeal to the court to set aside his conviction on the ground of a wrong decision on any question of law or on any other ground that there was a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided that the Full Court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised  in  the appeal might be decided in favour  of  the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has actually occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 would have thought that, whatever might be the views which lawyers hold in a very technical sense about the matters  Senator Byrne  has raised - and I for one do not share them in this context - if there was no injustice in the result that was arrived at it would not lead to the conclusion to which  Senator Byrne  asks the Senate to come, namely, that the decision should be rescinded- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were clearly established, and I believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done and was fairly done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, taking what 1 think was a proper, fair and broad view, the Senate has tempered <span class="highlight">justice</span> with mercy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It imposed it fairly, with <span class="highlight">justice</span> and with propriety, and it was a proper decision for this Senate to come to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us go back and in the name of conscience have another complete discussion on whether at all stages we have given these people natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were worried about the question of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not enter this debate as a lawyer because I am not one, but as one who has some respect for natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, particularly as it applies to the rights of honourable senators to bring before the Senate matters that they consider to be in the interests of the Senate and the citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact that we have these rights, does not give us the power to ignore the ordinary concepts of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the forms of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> which have been found by the courts of England and Australia over the ages to be necessary to carry out natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to establish the right of this Parliament to express its own rule of law for the examination of members of the public by its committees, surely we do not want to make all the mistakes which were made by the courts of law in England as it developed the principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that apply in the administration of law today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a legal man and must realise that this is an established case of a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne  never suggested that there had been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that such procedures are applied in some countries that have a different concept of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a different concept of human rights from those that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands at least that before a sentence is passed a person found guilty should be given the right to speak at the eleventh hour in his own defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all those reasons,  Senator Poke,  I believe that those who have disagreed with  Senator Byrne  and who have complained about the time that has been consumed by this debate have not done proper <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the dignity of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not fail to take every precautionary measure to protect the natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> that should be afforded to citizens who may at any time offend and who may have to appear before us, as a judicial tribunal, when we may be called upon rightly to impose sentences upon those people to protect the rights of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, therefore, gives us much higher responsibility to ensure that our forms shall not be lesser than those of the courts but instead will be even more powerful in protecting the natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the rights of somebody who even wishes to plead, when guilty, for the mercy of those who are about to sentence him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise only because I think it is a tribute to the Senate’s sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that it has listened to everything that has been said on behalf of the mover of this motion with an appropriate patience and quiet of attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them had taken legal advice, ls it any wonder that when questions of miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> are canvassed  Senator Little  says that that is not  Senator Byrne’s  proposition and that the claim is that the Senate has made a mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate affirms that decision, as I hope it will, I believe that that will be a satisfaction to everybody who took part in the proceedings in May, because 1 for my part would not relish the situation if it were thought by any considerable number of honourable senators that we had lacked a sense of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and had not been scrupulous to observe every precaution which would ensure a proper and just adjudgment of the situation so far as the editors were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, we were under an obligation to have regard for judicial procedures, and it is in our departure from the observance of those procedures that, in my submission, a violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be no discredit to the Senate if on a calm consideration of the proposition it should find that there has been a violation of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the economics of this, it is hardly social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this chamber a spokesman for the Australian Democratic Labor Party used the term
          natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that I have ever in my lifetime heard the term natural
          <span class="highlight">justice</span> used so extensively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time while that debate was on doI recall any spokesman for the
          Democratic Labor Party appealing for natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> on behalf of Ronald Walsh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may
          well be argued that, strictly speaking, the term natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> does not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I
          am of the opinion that men of goodwill would have extended the term natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to
          the Ronald Walsh case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If members
          of the Waterside Workers Federation withdrew their labour in support of a friend, a mate
          or a co-worker then I believe that that union was only carrying out its traditional role
          - a role which has ever been the role of the trade union movement wherever injustice has
          been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nimmo and Professor Downing of Melbourne University have estimated

    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Nimmo went further and
          said there were 250,000 low income families in a self-perpetuating poverty belt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have, on
          repeated occasions, put before the Australian people proposals to remove the injustices
          that have been built into the Australian economic system during 22 years of Liberal
          government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to put those proposals to the Australian people, and we

          economic, to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It never ceases to amaze me that, although we are so capable of socking the taxpayer in this way and we have  a  total Budget of about $9,000m, we are not able to apply some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in marginal cases in such fields as housing and pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>wants to peruse it - even a layman - will see there indisputable evidence that there is an obligation on the Government to see that this man receives some sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should say to you,  Mr Deputy President,  that I personally hold the strong view, and have held it throughout my lifetime, that capital punishment should never have found any position at all in British law, that it is indeed antipathetic to the whole spirit and conscience of what we call the ‘British system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo with whom I spoke this morning was another who served on that Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner the DLP takes stock of itself and acts in a sensible manner and applies a sensible consideration to the social service proposals advanced by the Australian Labor Party the sooner the hardships of the people will be dispelled and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> be restored to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  wish to continue by referring to some sections of the Budget in which the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  when presenting it, claimed that <span class="highlight">justice</span> had now been done to all those who are required to survive with the aid of social service payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a clear need in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to rectify the number of anomalies that exist in pension payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the child endowment scheme is the only way in which we can maintain any measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the fellow who is married and who is sincerely trying to do something for his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this situation must appeal to people, but unfortunately it goes overboard with so many and is overlooked for too long by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before I move an amendment to  Senator Brown’s  amendment I would say that in this matter of social services each and every one of us, irrespective of the party to which we belong, must at all times be conscious of the necessity to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to sections of our people who, because of circumstances in many cases beyond their control, are in a state not far removed from poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest.,  Mr Acting Deputy Chairman,  that it would be a sheer impossibility for anyone to introduce a contentious matter in 20 minutes and do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect, no-one could possibly do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a subject such as that in 20 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all is said and done, 30 minutes is not a particularly long time but an honourable senator could do reasonable <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a subject he wanted to introduce if he were allowed 30 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he had had 20 minutes he could not have done <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his argument for the simple reason that the topic he was referring to in the debate yesterday was of great significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  am aware that a decision was given in the Northern Territory Supreme Court yesterday by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster in regard to an action which was brought by the Attorney-General against certain members of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory who had purported by resolution to appoint persons with what might be described as ombudsman-like powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is despite opinions expressed by many eminent lawyers - none more eminent, I suggest, than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer, who was a senator and sat in this chamber and who gave a legal opinion in relation to section  47  of the Act which specifies quite clearly and properly that the onus of proof is on the Commission when rejecting a claim made by a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view a legal opinion submitted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer-  -Senator the  Honourable J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These claimants sometimes leave a tribunal knowing full well that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not properly been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I may be wrong, but I believe that there has been an apparent injustice done or that there has been a neglect to dispense <span class="highlight">justice</span> to deserving individuals while less deserving individuals seem to get more than they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the public servant, or, for that matter, anyone in the community believes that he can maintain his standard of living and not contribute to it by his own personal effort and by giving a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay, which is good old Labor policy, he is not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to himself, his fellow citizens or the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that some of the great superannuation funds operating in the community are probably unable because of inflation to meet the demands of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and will be unable in the future to provide the same value of pension as they have provided in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it to be the principle that the person assaulted has the right to kill but if the criminal succeeds in his purpose and gets in before the victim, society, preserving as it most carefully does one of the most cherished systems of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in human history, scaling the evidence and giving ali care before a jury is invited to convict, is not entitled to visit on that criminal the condemnation which would have been fully justified at the victim’s hands? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that is contrary to our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which requires that a defendant should have notification of hearing, trial and anything relating lo court proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Government dicided to invite the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  P. B.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is fortunate to secure the services of this distinguished gentleman and I wish to record my appreciation on behalf of the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  of the action of the New South Wales Government which has agreed to make  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose has a wide legal and Army background and is eminently suited to the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had a distinguished career at the Bar which culminated in his appointment to the Supreme Court Bench, firstly as an acting <span class="highlight">justice</span> in 1966 to 1967 and subsequently to a permanent appointment in June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose served throughout the 1939/45 war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am confident that the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose will be well received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, who has been appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, had for some 5 years before his appointment been the Senior Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are relatively unsophisticated, as compared with the procedures in the Supreme Court, but are reasonably well suited to the purpose of achieving <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the parties where the amount in dispute is small and where more thorough and expensive procedures are unwarranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is something not so superficial that it should be jettisoned in order to save a few dollars; if so, will he order these outback visits to be resumed immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I am making is if we had regional groups to analyse some of these decisions we would have speedier <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister make an immediate statement, in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness, unequivocally clearing the Mataungan Association of the innuendo of complicity which the Administration is unashamedly seeking to fix on it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The necessary procedures under that Act have been complied with and, following hearings by the Industrial Registrar together with certain appeals before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aird, have resulted in the request being granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn has been giving a great deal of his time in assisting with the judicial work of the Court, but it is desirable that he should be able to devote most of his time to his duties as  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those honourable senators who want to understand this should go to the Library and get the report on Tibet of the International Commission of Jurists, of which our own  Sir Owen  Dixon, then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia and the greatest jurist in the free world at the time, was a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that regard it is necessary to provide some element of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that view is generally held, but I think it does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to  Sir Garfield  Barwick ‘s proposals to regard the current Bill as so different from them as not really to be part and parcel of what he initially proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Attorney-General may elect, instead of proceeding by indictment for an offence against this section, to institute proceedings in the High Court by way of civil action for the recovery of the pecuniary penalties for the offence; in which case the action shall be tried before a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of that Court without a jury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is because a judge knows that he is there to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> as between the parties, and if there is any impediment which would prevent him from not only doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> but also giving the appearance that he is doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> he will make that apparent to the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon said that this was a legislative trick; the legislature does not say what the law is and then say that you make an application - you can do it in the one stroke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Murphy  compared this provision with the situation that existed in the days when the monarchy reigned supreme, when the monarch decided whom he would prosecute and whom he would not prosecute, when he would dispense <span class="highlight">justice</span> and when he would not dispense <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> it is prudent from time to time that some prosecutions should be launched only with the authority of the Attorney-General, the Crown Solicitor or some person who represents government so as to prevent a constant avalanche of private prosecutions being instituted by people who feel that they have some crusade in which they must engage but which is designed purely to harass people in a way in which they should not be harassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it must be acknowledged, because of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the situation, that those judges who were previously appointed on an anticipation that like Federal judges they would have life tenure, will have that life tenure preserved for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that honourable senators will welcome the opportunity that Australia has been afforded through the initiative of the Government of Fiji, to co-operate with a Pacific neighbour with which Australia looks forward to having an increasingly close association.I am sure too that honourable senators will be pleased that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo has accepted the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill now before the Senate has therefore the short purpose of excluding the application of sub-section (2) of section 103a of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo’s appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji.I am sure that the Senate will cordially welcome the appointment that it has been my pleasure to announce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

      <li>The Committee’s conclusions and recommendations are too numerous for me to read in full to the Senate and I believe ;o extract just a few would not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-47">[More…]</a></li>

    <p>lt could well be, as I have said, that there is too great a difference between the salaries of heads of some departments and those of officers of lower rank, lt has been stated publicly that if political heads followed these departments it may be a restraining influence on wage fixing authorities giving <span class="highlight">justice</span> to heads of departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A notice appeared in newspapers throughout Australia in mid-November in which the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  P. B.

    <p>A major legal difficulty encountered by Officers of the Narcotics Bureau in bringing drug traffickers to <span class="highlight">justice</span> is the necessity to produce direct evidence that drugs seized have been imported into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of the settlers were brought in South Australia and judgment was given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 6 of his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bright said that properties purchased for the settlement of ex-servicemen had been zoned according to the similarity of the types of country and until all holdings had been allotted and re-valued in accordance with the War Service Land Settlemerit Agreement the rental could not be finally fixed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bright in his judgment also found that the proper method of fixing the rental for the petitioner’s land was to assess the value in terms of paragraph 5 of the conditions set down by the Department; that is, to take  2i  per cent of the capital value with the adjustments provided therein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee now has a responsibility to the Senate and to the Australian public to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the material that has been amassed and to ensure that its conclusions and recommendations are sound and practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is very much in our wishes that the salaries appropriate to these very distinguished public officials should have been proceeded with unimpeded according to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and relative to other determinations which have been made by arbitral tribunals and bodies that have the power to fix wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest it would be an injustice for parliamentarians, for instance - that is what we are - to be extending this situation into the non-political arena in the way that has been suggested in the speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that we will mete out summary <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as apparently it is thought to be, to some people by means of a Bill related to a matter which was introduced into the Parliament before we actually did anything about the Kerr report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr was to separate the Parliament- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Kerr was put down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Government spoke about dispensing summary <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he moved outside of the field in talking about dispensing summary <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Government referred to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr on parliamentary salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me tell  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson that it would not have mattered whether the report was made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr or by any other person; I had intended to raise an objection to large increases being granted to these people whose salaries are determined by statute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">justice</span> had been done our salaries should have followed suit and we should have receieved an additional $3,000 a year then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fairness of the case must appeal to anyone with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a sense of fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was that a demonstration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Senate - this is the main reason I rose to speak - that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s report has no bearing on my decision in relation to this issue at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am extremely anxious that <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be done and that we should end up with a result which is satisfactory and not subject to challenge or innuendo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-58-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to the appointment of an Australian judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, who is to travel to and take up residence in Fiji and, there, to act as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fiji is a fairly equally divided multi-racial society of Indians and indigenous Fijians and perhaps it is because of that that the Fijian Government has required a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to come from another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who know Aboriginal thinking about their relation to land with which they are associated, or those who have read the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn in the Gove land case, will know that the traditional Aboriginal relationship to land does not fit in with what is known in the Australian system as ‘freehold”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were following the procedure adopted in the United States, Canada and in other countries we would say to the committee dealing with constitutional and legal affairs: ‘You will consider all matters of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, bankruptcy, copyright, the Judiciary Act, administrative review matters and so on’, and then leave the committee to deal with the various aspects which were important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, does he not think that the advice given in evidence last week by the Federal Secretary of the Merchant Services Guild, Captain Sam Benson, if accepted in full, could have  saved  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Frank i from having belatedly to discover today that the vessel in question is defined as a maritime maverick since it requires a permit to operate off the Australia coast? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hearsay rale, in its present form, with its numerous exceptions, is said to lack rational basis, to result sometimes in injustice and often in avoidable expense and to introduce much unnecessary complication in the preparation and hearing of civil actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The object of the whole Bill is to facilitate the proof of the real facts in issue both in the interests of proper <span class="highlight">justice</span> be ng done in court and in enabling proceedings to be disposed of as quickly as they properly can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>provide means whereby the court, if it considers it necessary in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> so to do, may require the witness to answer but only with the protection of a certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the court may be able to obtain the evidence it needs in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the case before it, but at the same time prevent the witness from providing a later prosecutor with an admission or confession that would be admissible against the witness if he were the accused under the exception to the hearsay rule relating to admissions and confessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Zelling in a recent case, R. v.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was because British <span class="highlight">justice</span> has always held fairly strongly to the belief that an accused should be tried on the evidence of the commission of the offence presesented by the prosecution and not on his past record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two justices of the High Court in the case of Bridge v. The Queen (1964) -38 ALJR 280 drew attention to several factors which make the New South Wales position unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer pointed out that it is unreal to think that a jury these days is unaware that the accused may testify on his own behalf and that it is unaffected by the accused’s failure to offer an explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer also noted that there is no prohibition on the jury drawing an inference from the accused’s failure to testify which may be adverse to the accused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all, therefore, it is considered that the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> will best be served by allowing the judge to comment on the accused’s failure to testify. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, British <span class="highlight">justice</span> has gone to great pains to allow a person on trial for his liberty to present his case as best he can and not to impair an accused’s right to discredit or attack others unless the attack is of little or no relevance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Adrian  Knox, dealt with the extent of the responsibility of the Attorney-General in law cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A famous English judge, Lord <span class="highlight">Justice</span> A. L. Smith, sated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the existing Ministerial Arrangements Order the Attorney-General is responsible for law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He must not intrude party politics into the consideration of any case - the reason is obvious - because it becomes impossible for him then to exercise calmly and judicially the various discretions which it may become his duty to exercise and, more important still, the public tends to lose confidence in the impartial administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great judges have made it clear that a statement is prejudicial and a contempt of court if it tends to prejudice a fair trial - that is, if its tendency is to deprive the court of doing that which is the end for which it exists; namely, to administer <span class="highlight">justice</span> duly, impartially and with reference solely to the facts judicially brought before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But with equal <span class="highlight">justice</span> we could do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So casual is the Attorney-General in his approach to the truth, so casual is the Attorney-General in his approach to <span class="highlight">justice</span>, so casual is the Attorney-General in his approach to the spirit of the rule of law, so imbued with fanaticism for selfadvancement and for the denigration of the Australian Labor movement is the AttorneyGeneral that not only does he set out to discredit people who are awaiting trial but also he falsely maligns in this Parlia- meat people who have been tried already and acquitted, and never once do we find sufficient character in the man to apologise for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that action which is being criticised without a word of implication as to what would have happened if  Mr Johnston  had accepted the processes of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> and appeared before the court with all the opportunities of having the case heard and then making submissions to show his own innocence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We cannot have a society where some people say that the only laws which people have to obey are the laws which they want to obey or, as members of the ALP say in their curious language: The only laws you have to comply with are the laws which meet your own personal ideas of <span class="highlight">justice</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He asked how I, as Attorney-General, could sit here listening to all the mud and abuse which is flung at me time and again by members of the Opposition and be expected to be dispassionate, to sit as a judge when he administers <span class="highlight">justice</span>, just sit here and take it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is not a matter of what the numbers are; it is a matter of what the truth is and what the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the issue is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I want to say in that respect is that I. will yield place to no-one in my insistence that employers carry out such obligations as are associated with national service and give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those of their employees who are required to enter upon national service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposal was rejected by both the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the Government on the grounds, firstly, that the suggestion was far too wide to be handled by a committee of this sort and, secondly, that there were not enough bodies to go around; in other words, that the Senate’s committees were so cluttered up that we would be unable to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the motion that I moved on Tuesday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those who appear before it I suggest it would be a kind of tribunal which manifestly would not be very capable of giving an objective view or of giving any kind of reasonable <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. R. Kerr, C.M.G., has been appointed as the arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, has for some time teen  chairman  of the Committee of Inquiry on Pay for the Armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s finding will be accepted by the Government as determining the appropriate fees for general practitioner consultations and home visits in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The formal terms of reference and final details of the procedures to be followed by the arbitrator will be settled after I have further consulted with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 should like to inform honourable senators of the circumstances in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr was able to accept the appointment as arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr came to this decision on the ground that there is no need to continue his full-time involvement with the Committee’s activities at this stage of its advanced deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government today asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr to postpone his return to judicial duties until after the end of April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accepting the appointment of arbitrator in relation to medical fees,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr made clear to me that, in view of the timetable for the medical fees arbitration, the finalisation of his deliberations in the Committee of Inquiry on Pay for the Armed Services would not be delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no other way can <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done to pensioners and other lower income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the only point at which it seems to me that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done to this young man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that most unusual steps have been taken by the Commonwealth Police and the courts to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will not be done when one thing that this country supposedly prides itself on is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but must appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having put down the broad pattern of the appointment of the arbitrator and the broad pattern of the terms of reference, as I said last, night there are still some discussions that I, as the responsible Minister, need to have with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr before the precise- terms of reference are put down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost impossible to convince them that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done when the opportunity to ask that particular question is denied by the court or is not available under the rules of evidentiary law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact it often appears to the lawyer that the cause of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not being served by that denial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if, with all the affluence of wealth,  Senator Cavanagh,  as an applicant to the court for an order, felt that courtesy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> required that the bank manager should be served before he made an application, then - notwithstanding what would appear to be a breach of the prohibition contained in clause 24 (2.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after such an accident occurs, it is the practice for a safety officer or an industrial officer employed by the company to investigate the circumstances of the accident, to take statements often with the assistance of an interpreter and to reduce those statements to writing, have them signed and witnessed by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and preserved against the possibility of just such litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think for one moment that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is a person who is concerned to treat lightly the right of accused persons in trials in the courts of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the other persons who participated -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason,  Mr Harding,  Professor Waller,  Dr Cross  and the officers of the Attorney-General’s Department - have achieved in their approach to this a fair result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was at the first Commonwealth Law Conference to be held in Australia that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of India said that the law is full of technicalities and necessary procedures and that sometimes the observance of these technicalities or procedures leads to injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that one cannot expect perfect <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but that if we are to have it done with a degree of efficiency, if we are to provide that injustice is not done the other way by providing so many avenues of appeal and so many protections, etc., one has to accept that there will be certain injustices through the operation of procedural rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not deny that on occasions this may work some injustice but we feel a terrible breach in this court prin ciple would occur if we were to make spouses compellable witnesses and compellable to disclose communications made between them during the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>committee has decided in this instance is justifiable, prudent and in accordance with what ought to be facilitated in the ends of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the society in which we now live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How that aids <span class="highlight">justice</span>, 1 do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it did not elaborate philosophic concepts  it  did indicate the changing patterns, the changing standards, and how from the idea of the sancitity of marriage as a prime consideration we are now moving to an area in which pursuit to truth and doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> are the primary considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would create a dichotomy which I feel would work against the ends of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which litigation is designed to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where, in a proceeding, a person called as a witness or required to answer an interrogatory declines to answer a question or interrogatory under the last preceding sub-section, the court may, if it is satisfied that, in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the person should be compelled to answer the question or interrogatory, inform the person - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that if a person is before a court - maybe unwilling before a court - because he is able to give evidence in the court proceedings it i in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that he be compelled to answer the question or to accept the penalty for not answering If it be said that that is a difficult situation into which to put a person because if he answers the question he may incriminate himself, what is fairer than to say to him: ‘If that is the difficulty you have in answering the question, any answer you give cannot be used in any proceedings which may be taken against you afterwards and in respect of which you have this fear of incriminating yourself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prerogative of mercy has been exercised in this field with what I would think was fairly general satisfaction to the sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable senators, not for the first time, but now in about my 22nd or 23rd year in this Parliament, and still persevering - not always in a cause in which 1 know I shall win, but, as heretofore, persevering in a cause in which I believe there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> - that we cast a great deal of disadvantage and a great deal of injustice on the Armed Forces if we relieve the traitor who commits the offences that I have mentioned form the supreme penalty simply to gratify a sociological generalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in the Parliament formulate the law so that courts will have a law capable of being applied with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At all events, I maintain that it needs very scant consideration of the factors involved in maintaining a police force or a force of prison guards to see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of applying this deterrent against anybody who would be minded to murder a policeman or a prison warder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that policeman had not successfully dealt with his victim as his victim would have been dealt with by sentence of death if he had come before a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, can anybody say that <span class="highlight">justice</span> wou’d not have required that the death penalty be imposed as a deterrent against that sort of conduct, in defence of the police? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me add that all members of the community who have a potential for crimes of violence would be deterred, and the police would have that encouragement which comes from <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that al least they would feci that their assailant had the deterrent of capital punishment if he thought that he would murder a policeman whose duty it is to secure him and arrest him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does not this contrast with the separate decisions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr granting orders nisi for these very actions to be heard on 26th April? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should avoid action of that kind, but at the same time I would hate to see a situation arise in which through our zest for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if I may put it that way, we create so many escape hatches that witnesses may not be inclined to give the evidence that is wanted from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Bonner  thinks that is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which his people are entitled, I do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Attorney-General: Is this trial regarded as one in which Australia has a considerable interest to see that the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is duly carried out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who argue for a means test to be applied to assistance with recurrent expenditure in independent schools have not been able to establish principles or criteria which can clearly be applied with equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the range of independent schools and to their students and parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Democratic Labor Party welcomes the spirit of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the allocation of Commonwealth moneys for education which is embodied in these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember times when the question of assistance - I prefer to call it <span class="highlight">justice</span> - to independent schools was brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am prepared to say that in my State the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party is as completely and totally opposed to any form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for independent schools as ever it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the general body of the community is concerned, gall up polls have shown that the great bulk of the Australian people are fairminded enough to endorse the principle that independent schools should obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even parliamentarians and economists who are not entirely in favour of it as a principle have recognised that economically it is necessary for the state because, as they have seen, unless <span class="highlight">justice</span> and assistance are given to the independent schools to keep them in being, governments would be in the position of having to pay the full cost of students who attend the independent schools instead of, as at present, only a portion of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, thanks to the pioneering of the Democratic Labor Party, thanks to the decision made by the Government parties to follow in the same strain and thanks to the final agreement of the Australian Labor Party - but only with considerable blood, sweat and tears - to recognise the electoral significance of this question, we reached a stage some time ago when it could be claimed and it was claimed that all parties were in favour of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or aid for independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that if the system, as practised in South Australia under the Dunstan Labor Government, were brought into being in the Commonwealth sphere by a Whitlam government it would destroy the whole principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which has been evolved under the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It offered no <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the independent schools and it had given them an amount of money which could be described only as humiliating while at the same time concentrating the immense volume of money available for education on government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he saw to it that the amount of money that it received to operate was such that independent schools were almost completely denied <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, he destroys the principle of fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span> which ought to be the basis of any arrangement in regard to these schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doing what it believes is right and proper in terms of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and assistance to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, will the Minister for Health advise whether there will be lack of continuity in the New <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that I made a statement in the Senate announcing the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr to conduct an inquiry concerning items 1 and 4 of the schedule in respect of general practitioners in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After holding a preliminary meeting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr was appointed by the New South Wales Government as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Designate of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason was appointed to take over the inquiry from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very happy to be able to say that we were able to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason to take over the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason yesterday held the second meeting of the inquiry, on the day on which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr would have held his second meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not completely sure of that, but I think that was the timing planned by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not anticipate any delay in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason’s taking any evidence that he wishes to take, interviewing witnesses he wishes to hear and making a report to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be a variation of a day or two but, in general, I do not anticipate any significant alteration of the timing from the original proposal for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr to report to the Government at the end of April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason will be doing everything possible to get his report to the Government as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members are aware of the work of the committee headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr which has made a comprehensive review of the fundamental conditions of service in the forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he indicate to the Senate what action will be taken to deal with the pay dispute and what steps he proposes to take to ensure some relativity and some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the lower paid employees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the honourable senator talks about disputes with technical air crew he will understand that in the end these are referred to the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal -  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Coldham - which deals with the disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr has been promoted to another position, but about 7 or 8 months ago he recommended that the Canberra allowance be raised to $22 a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of the statement made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court on 16th February 1972 in which he criticised the serious under-staffing of the Social Welfare Branch of the Department of the Interior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An increase in staff had been in train for some time when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox made his comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With all due respect to the honourable gentlemen who comprised the committee headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, as the Attorney said, different people have different approaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The authorities in Western Australia advise me that, under the Liberal Party-Country Party Government in Western Australia, the terms and conditions for the release of prisoners were very restricted and that the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> would not agree to any liberalisation of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we want to argue about the need for an equal sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> I have a file of correspondence between myself and the former Minister for Immigration,  Mr Lynch,  which relates to a Spanish migrant whom the Department would not naturalise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that  Senator Mulvihill  did not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the broad plea which he is making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say in conclusion that the lactic used by  Senator Keeffe  is a tactic which ought to be disowned by his colleagues because they have made some play from time to time on the claim that they believe in certain standards of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONWhen this inquiry was originally set up under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr - it is now under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason - I thought I made it clear that I did not think it would be proper for me to be reflecting on matters which were before the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The honourable senator should either put his question on the notice paper for answering after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason has put down his report or accept my answer that 1 cannot comment at this point of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> I ask the Minister whether he will examine the transcript of this hearing and if necessary consult Judge Hewitt to ascertain what deficiencies exist, if any, in the National Service Act which prohibit or inhibit a judge from exercising his judicial judgment and discretion based on the evidence placed before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House are still very concerned that although ostensibly the Government has increased the rate of repatriation pensions in the case of invalid and age pensions, it has not given full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all those who at the present time are receiving war pensions or are entitled to receive them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A situation cannot arise in which the Government treats public servants in the way in which it intends to treat them, namely, as a separate class of workers to whom it will not give the same measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as it gives to workers generally under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have an instance following an opinion by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Garfield  Barwick and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer in what is known as the La Macchia case that the State jurisdiction finished at the low water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as soon as the Senate referred that matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, the Government established a private inquiry into the repatriation system to be presided over by  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose will be presented to the Minister for Repatriation, not to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Noone has considered how much it has contributed to welfare or social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister not acknowledge that such an alteration to the income tax laws should be applied in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those people who are self-employed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he make representations to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to expedite its consideration of this matter as in many cases <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he acknowledge that neither <span class="highlight">justice</span> nor equity appears to exist for those parents who find it necessary to place children in child care centres and pay fees for that service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry was carried out at the request of the Government by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason who took over from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr on his appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason has now determined that the following fees were fair and reasonable as the fees to be adopted for the purpose of the medical benefits scheme for the period 1st July 1971 to 30th June 1973: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mason has, however, noted that the result of his determination would be that doctors in New South Wales who have charged the most common fee have, since 1st July 1971, in effect lost income equivalent to 10c for each surgery consultation and 40c for each home visit during almost half of the 2-year period for which the fees should apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mason has emphasised that, if it should be decided to add a further 10c to the most common fee for item 1, thereby bringing it up to $4 for the balance of the 2-year period ending on 30th June 1973, subsequent calculations of the most common fee for the next 2-year period, that is, 1st July 1973 to 30th June 1975, should proceed as if the amount determined for the entire current 2-year period ending on 30th June 1973 had been $3.90. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has given careful consideration to the determinations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason and has decided that the following most common fees will apply in New South Wales for the period 1st July 1972 to 30th June 1973- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: What are the Federal conciliation authorities doing to reinforce the attempts by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cahill of the New South Wales Industrial Commission to settle the dispute, which attempts by him have been specifically rejected by the newspaper proprietors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to a statement by  Dr Peter  Arnold of the General Practitioners Society that the new medical, fees recommended by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason will make little difference to doctors and that the Society has no intention of recommending to its members that they change their fees in any way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that as far as New South Wales is concerned a great number of doctors for some time have been charging much more than the new fee determined by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason and that, therefore, the patients under those doctors still will have the burden of bridging the gap between the fee charged and the refund payable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  has put this suggestion informally to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer to see them be big enough to make that apology than force a young man without resources to go to a civil jurisdiction to seek <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take the heat out of the debate by saying that the protection of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> is no monopoly of anyone in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day we do this will be the day we do a disservice to Parliament and to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no doubt at all that as far as I am concerned, and I hope I speak for all honourable senators on my side of the House, if any citizen in this country feels that he has been denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> let him come forward, produce the evidence and we will help him to get the full recourse of <span class="highlight">justice</span> under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee consists of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, as  Chairman, Mr J.  M. Rodd, a Melbourne solicitor, and  Mr P.  C. E. Cox, a Sydney accountant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely contrary to the British system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These laws and <span class="highlight">justice</span> provisions have been discussed previously with the Attorney-General’s Department during the debate on the pig and dried fruits research legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned at the time that one of their greatest grievances was in relation to the principle of comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, no <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been meted out to those who tried to deceive us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his 1971 report did  Sir Richard  Kirby express the urgent necessity for a new appointment of a commissioner and a further judge to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his Report for the year ended 13th August 1971 the  President  said that the need for another Commissioner still urgently existed as well as a Judge to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 23rd May 1972  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki, a  Deputy President  of the Commission, became a Judge of the Com monwealth Industrial Court and as from the same date  Mr J.  T. Ludeke, Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He drew attention to the fact that the success of those claims materially defeated the ambitions of those in the less glamorous jobs in the airways industry of receiving industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators asked me to crystallise my main objection to this legislation I simply say this: After a prolonged national wage inquiry and after judges have determined a percentage increase that can be met by industry - I am dealing solely with wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> now - if there were a price freeze for 6 or 8 months we would not see the flow-throughs which occur when people realise that within 3 weeks the prices of basic commodities go up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in Britain when the Wilberforce report which brought <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the power station workers of Britain was presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of this situation we find in the legislation before us an attempt to put the clock back, as I have said, on the matter of machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes and in the matter of sanctions which the Government seeks to have at its disposal to enforce its will on working men seeking wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those procedures are being juggled about in some endeavour to prevent flow-ons and to prevent real wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> being done throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have some effect, namely, in creating injustices in relation to small unions and groups which cannot really cope with these procedural difficulties which are being created by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Griffith referred to that section, which was then section 58, and said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will find that in that case the High Court - in particular,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullagar, with whom the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kitto concurred - set out in the most clear and definite terms that the trade unions which were registered organisations under this Act were, by the very section to which I have referred, made corporations under Federal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the scale of charges payable to general practitioners under the Repatriation Act also the subject of review by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr in his consideration of general practitioner charges to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those were the words of the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullagar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were concurred in by the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Owen  Dixon, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kitto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we examine the composition of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, I think it must be conceded that any trade union organisation and particularly the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that has been able to achieve any gains for its membership from that august body must have produced  strong arguments to convince it of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of union claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is remarkable that the trade union movement has been able to overcome some of that conservatism and has induced members of the Commission to grant some <span class="highlight">justice</span> in respect to wage claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to refer only to the statements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby to establish quite clearly that the trade union movement in this country has acted responsibly and has not put on strikes willy nilly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The costs that are the cause of union members seeking economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> are pushed up by other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that situation is corrected, this escalation of costs and prices will continue and will lead to further just demands by workers, whether they be farmers, shopkeepers or anything else, for economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concern of the DLP, and particularly of  Senator Little,  is to place impositions on the worker and to complain continually about his demands for wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know how it has come about that an error which was evident in a case heard in 1959 by the Full Bench of the Commonweal th Industrial Court, constituted by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Spicer and Justices Dunphy and Morgan, has taken until 1972 to be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby,  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in his 1970 report to the Parliament commented on the need for 2 additional commissioners to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his 1971 report did  Sir Richard  Kirby express the urgent necessity for a new appointment of a commissioner and a further judge to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report for the year ended 13th August 1971 the  President  said that the need for another Commissioner still urgently existed as well as a judge to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 23rd May 1972  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki, a  Deputy President  of the Commission, became a judge of the commonwealth Industrial Court and as from the same date  Mr J.  T. Ludeke, Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August 1970  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby had reported that there was a need for 2 commissioners if the Commission was to operate properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was that the reason in 1970 why we could not fill the position that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby said should be filled so that the Act could be properly administered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A factor which we have to bear in mi’nd very carefully is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the remuneration which is given in the public sector in comparison with that received in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to have the profession so divided and so fragmented that it is an encumbrance upon the proper administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a very great inconvenience and cost to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that if there was a responsibility on the Parliament to interfere with the recommendations of an independent tribunal and to reject the wage levels that were suggested for top public servants 6 months ago - those public servants are in exactly the same category as these conciliation commissioners - the position of commissioners should not be placed before the Parliament until the whole issue is brought before the Parliament and <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was right to penalise some people in the interests of setting an example to the community in relation to wage restraint, I believe we should be consistent and continue with that approach until we feel that the danger of inflation has abated to such an extent that complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be done to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe - I can only stress it strongly - that there ought to be a responsiblity in the Senate, as one of the two Houses of Parliament, to recognise that the conciliation commissioners are entitled, as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to have an increase in their remuneration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate has asserted - it has so asserted, and I agreed with the assertion - that the salaries pf statutory office holders should be fixed by the Parliament and not by the relevant Minister or by administrative action, there is a correlative obligation to ensure that we do <span class="highlight">justice</span> and do not wreak petty vengenance - if that is what it be - on the Government by denying conciliation commissioners that to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us recognise that plain <span class="highlight">justice</span> entitles persons who have not had any salary increase in 4 years, in a job that was well but not highly remunerated in 1968 and at a level to which no exception was taken at that time by the Labor Party, to an increase over the intervening 4 year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the conciliation commissioners not having received a salary increase for 4 years, where do we start imposing this restraint? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kind of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is it when we discriminate against a small number of people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is their <span class="highlight">justice</span> when a handful of people are picked out and punished? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I challenge members of the Labor Party to say that, as a party, it will accept  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s recommendations in full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  referred to the matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose everybody can make a decision as to what is <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all have our views on what is <span class="highlight">justice</span>, whether it be in relation to wages, salaries or something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might think that as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> I should be getting 3 times what I am getting now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another person might think that as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> I should be getting half of what I am getting now, as that is all I am worth, and that person may be right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not think that this reference to a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is an argument that convinces me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There must be some reasonable relativity and some <span class="highlight">justice</span> across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the right way to correct the injustices that exist, after we in December made clear our point of view that there had to be a proper relativety amongst the salaries of these people, by presenting a Bill of this kind and apparently another Bill which is to be debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> is long overdue, not only in relation to the people I have mentioned but also in relation to the ordinary worker who has just been granted $2 a week by a decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest that it aggravates and points up the inequity and injustice of the situation that we should be faced with a proposition that we increase the salaries of conciliators from $9,500 to more than $16,000 and increase the salaries of conciliation commissioners by some $3,000 or $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am one who does not always give compliments easily to the judiciary, but I say that under the existing Act  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson played a notable role in the way in which he alternated meetings with the union and with the New South Wales transport department representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did evidence provided last week by the Federal Secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, Captain Benson, disclose that the ‘Texaco Scandinavia’ lacks a permit to operate in the Australian coastal trade and can be termed a ‘maritime maverick’; if so, would the acceptance of this evidence have avoided the need for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki to reach a similar conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is with very great regret that I have to inform the Senate of the death on 7th July last of  Sir Owen  Dixon, a former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, at the age of 86 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1926 he became Acting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1929 he was appointed as a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court from 1952 until his retirement in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 12 of those years, he was Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 trust that the portrait of  Sir Owen  which hangs in one of the lobbies of this Parliament the only portrait I can recall hanging in these halls of a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court who was not at some time a member of this Parliament - will be transferred to a more public position so that those who see it and who may not know may ask who this man was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was at no time a member of this Parliament, but he was a great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia in which is reposed the judicial power which the Constitution establishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  work as a member of the High Court over a period of some 35 years, for 12 of which he was Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, has left an indelible impact on the development of Australian constitutional law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the occasion when he was sworn in as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> he said that the function of the High Court in constitutional matters was to interpret a constitutional description of power or restraint upon power and to determine whether a given measure falls on one side of a line or on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Parker of England, Lord Chancel-‘ lor Simmons and judges of the Supreme Court of the United States of America have gone on record to say that he was acknowledged as pre-eminent as a jurist of the English-speaking courts of his period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I venture to say,  Mr President,  in the presence of my fellow senators that it was in application of these principles to our own specially important Constitution that the late Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> made his most substantial mark and contributed to the building of a body of doctrine which, in my assessment, will stamp his as an era of exposition superior in importance to the great constitutional decisions of the Stuart period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Knowing the temper of some of my colleagues and friends in State forestry services and the State Ministers responsible for forestry, I would think that there will be very considerable resentment that this has been set to one side for a series of observations and comments that they will believe are not necessary and which do them less than <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that the general principle is that, in circumstances such as those raised by  Senator Cavanagh,  where a question arises about the matter being within the terms of reference of the Independent Enquiry,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose is prepared to hear argument from the person concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think it is altogether appropriate to equate the need in the legal area to something approaching a national health scheme, but 1 do believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be available to everybody and that it should not be denied because of lack of means to assert rights before the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why I and other members of the Opposition have no confidence is that when we turn to the detailed inquiry that was conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo we find that among his recommendations was the proposal that the whole concept of health insurance should be transferred from the Commonwealth Department of Health to a national health insurance commission of 5 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox who delivered the leading judgment concluded the latter part of his judgment with these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a clear statement from the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before completing my speech 1 wish to make reference to a question that I asked of the ‘: Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  today about the need for British <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be available to every Australian citizen regardless of social or economic status or age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that I make the suggestion that perhaps some sort of insurance scheme would make it possible for people to feel that British <span class="highlight">justice</span> is within their reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Producers should unite more and demand that <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish that it had been declared so that we could get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for some of these young men who have returned from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years successive governments have endeavoured to find a way in which to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the needs of pensioners and at the same time provide a national retiring allowance on a basis which would not discourage prudent saving during a lifetime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is dispersed over the whole continent, particularly the eastern part, and is very active in its attempts to secure some measure of educational equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> for children in these parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, the senior judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other aspect of the judgments to which I will refer is what was said by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor who, in a separate judgment, concurred with the view expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many questions concerning the whole body of law in the Australian Capital Territory - of course, this is what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Connor referred to - which have to be clarified if there is to be orderly government in this Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any feeling that the honourable senator has suffered an injustice, the only way to rectify the situation is by granting an extension of time to the honourable senator when the debate on the Budget resumes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the matters that I have put before the Senate tonight I hope that there will be sufficient honesty and sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Government to give sympathetic and generous consideration to my suggestion that  Senator Georges  be permitted to continue his remarks in the Budget debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> among peoples, world financial and trading systems can and must be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Supreme Court, 2 pleas in criminal matters that were listed before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A claim for civil damages before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki in the Supreme Court was adjourned until 11.30 this morning to enable settlement negotiations between the parties to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What provision is being made for persons such as the one who appeared before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares today and made a habeas corpus application? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some mention has been made of Miss Russell and the application which was made to, I think,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares of the Supreme Court of New South Wales this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  who is in charge of this Bill: In the light of what has been said in this debate about the dire effects on the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory, if this Bill is not passed - the effects on civil rights and on the administration of the criminal lav? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be an impossible task to seek out everybody and, following the Opposition’s view, to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to them on the basis that they were unlawfully convicted, fined or imprisoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done to these individuals only if they are not prosecuted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a proposition in total <span class="highlight">justice</span> it seems to be the only reasonable and prudent course that can be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, a book issued by the Quakers entitled ‘The Struggle for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’ points out that the number of people convicted and dealt with under the criminal law is a minute fraction only of those who commit offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see this problem solved, but we want to see it solved within a framework of respect for the high principles of civic <span class="highlight">justice</span> and civil liberty for which we on this side of the chamber stand and to which honourable senators on the other side of the chamber constantly pay lip service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But perhaps the clearest statement of this principle is to be found in Kidmans’ case, decided by the High Court, in which this expression of opinion is given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite rightly, and in full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to him,  Senator Wheeldon  believed that no member of the Australian Labor Party felt that his conscience extended to being concerned about such a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that Labor senators will at least do me the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of listening to my reasons, even when I state that I am prepared to concede that undoubtedly as a result of the legislation there will be changes in the legal position in which some people may find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the case was before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox,” he pointed out that the Commonwealth had at all times had power on an application to the court to remove the tent and that the Commissioner of Police and the Minister admitted that the Commonwealth had this power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reaction of the Minister, apart from the completely unnecessary clashes which took place, has been to bring down a new ordinance - one which is unnecessary, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox pointed out, because of the already existing powers of the Commonwealth, but one in which significant changes in the law were made and made in a particlar direction to which all parties represented on the Senate committee which examines regulations and ordinances have always taken exception, namely, the procedure set out in section 8c (1.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because they are black and have been deprived for more than 200 years, in true colonial style, every member on the Government side - there is no exception - is prepared to continue to deprive them even of the right to demonstrate for what they believe to be <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable senator’s ques tion arises from a prejudiced viewpoint which I feel does not do him <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday that trial was adjourned for a month because <span class="highlight">justice</span> could not be given to those on trial because there had been so much publicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst these matters may arise certainly in the near future if a certain motion proceeds today, I think it is incumbent upon this Senate to recognise that <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country is to be found in the courts of the land and in the rights which individuals have to be tried by judge and jury in an atmosphere in which they get a fair trial and thai Parliament should not seek to usurp the role of the courts and to pass judgment on the basis of supposition, assumption and suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am alarmed if  Senator Murphy  is seeking to assert as a principle what he said today because it is a negation of all that he has said in the past, of the rule of law and of that <span class="highlight">justice</span> which we on this side would ever seek to uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is encumbent upon Australia, as it would be upon any civilised country, to see to it that there is an inquiry into those allegations so that it may either clear its name or take appropriate action to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is vindicated and that international law is vindicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is in each case to insure that wrongdoers can be brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think every person here has a healthy suspicion that the Attorney-General - not only from what has been said but by his behaviour and demeanour in this Senate - certainly does not want to investigate and prosecute these terrorists, as I think the rest of the people would want their activities to be investigated and the terrorists brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This basic obligation was well established by the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in 1949 in the Corfu Channel case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Vujcic,  who sat close to the tribune, jumped up and seized  Racic’s  right hand, but  Racic  hurled him back and simultaneously fired at  Pernar- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgency about finding the criminals and bringing them to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be the endeavour of each and every one of us to assist the Commonwealth and State police to bring these people to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to expose them to the full rigour of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there not room in this country for a Press Council such as the one that exists in New Zealand for the purpose of giving <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people whose views are incorrectly reported or are even not reported? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I refer to the emotional issues which involve <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Aborigines and the right of Aborigines to protest effectively by using the area in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox made it quite clear that in his judgment the campers had no right to camp on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other justices comprising the Court endorsed  His  Honour’s views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague  Senator Wilkinson  interjects, that will be the time when there will be <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the short life left to it I suggest that it make available a little <span class="highlight">justice</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be just a little because the Government is incapable of making available large quantities of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our desire to try to give social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Aboriginal people we moved at one stage to a position of paternalism, and that nas now been discovered to be an approach which is highly undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, he was giving us the facts and I feel that in sheer <span class="highlight">justice</span> to him I. should give the facts that I know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the gerrymander which existed in that State for many years, we were not able to form a government until  Mr Steele  Hall, who believes in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, introduced an electoral redistribution after the 1968 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in 1970, after the redistribution, with a lesser percentage of the overall vote than we received in 1968 we went back into Government with a majority of 7, because there was some sort of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> is that a man is innocent unless he is proven guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any member  of  the Labor Party knows anything about particular acts of violence let him say  so,  otherwise he should not do harm to <span class="highlight">justice</span> by alleging things of people without any facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne is not the only person’ who revealed that all this fine talk about the rule of law and great principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which we heard last week is just a facade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle is that it is our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that every man is presumed innocent until he is proven guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to either the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories or the Attorney-General, whoever is the more appropriate, or to both of them in their respective capacities, lt concerns the public outcry in Papua New Guinea about telephone tapping and eavesdropping by public officials in connection with the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the reports that even the conversations of lawyers with their clients have been telephone tapped, to use the ordinary expression, and that there seems to be no law to prevent this or, if there is, that it is not being enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, when the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare had repatriation referred to it for investigation - I might say that it is not doing a bad job - the Government decided that it would appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to carry out an independent investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know from the evidence I see from day to day that many ex-servicemen receive less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> from this Government because it is prepared to be less than generous in interpreting the Repatriation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even a former Prime Minister of the present Government, only a few days ago, said that the Repatriation Act ought to be amended to see that such people receive some sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How often has a visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> attended the Darwin Gaol in the past 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a regular time-table set down for a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to visit the Gaol and, if there is no regular time-table, what is the reason for the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 12 months ended 31st August 1972 a visiting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> attended on 10 occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">Justice</span> should visit the Gaol at least once a month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Temporary absences of the Justices from Darwin have prevented compliance with this requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it in a position to check on any blurred spots to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already it hits had appointed as its  Chairman  the honour able  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kenneth William Asprey, Q.C., a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government intend to continue with the inquiry into income tax; if so, when does the Treasurer expect to be able to announce the names of the other members of the committee of inquiry to be chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the report in August 1970 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby of vacancies in the numbers of Industrial Commissioners, were any advertisements to fill the vacancies inserted in any newspaper between 1970 and June 1972 referred to in an answer given to  Senator Cavanagh  on 14th August 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put it this way: Just as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore played a vital role in the recent oil dispute, will there be a  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore at the Commonwealth level to save the Boyd Plateau? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey and I think it will have an immense amount of work to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, said in the course  of his judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an infringement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in relation to someone who holds an Australian passport, there should be an inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, something that does not accord with our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> may have happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that because of the increased numbers of working women with children who have to be cared for, such a change in the law would be greatly desirable in the national interest as well as in <span class="highlight">justice</span> to working mothers who relieve the community of social service payments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, will he immediately call a conference with the object of effecting comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can gain from the tenor of reports in the Press that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans’ judgment was that the takeover code was less than fully effective to protect the rights of investors and that possibly, as a result of that, some investigation could be make as to whether there should be amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Senate Committee and the committee headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey will be looking at this and at the anomalies which create hardship and will cure those anomalies and thereby do away with hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis was <span class="highlight">justice</span>, equity and relief of hardship for people involved in these situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question that we have to ask ourselves, as senators elect, is this: What <span class="highlight">justice</span> is in it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in forcing a person to sell property or to forgo other benefits under a will merely so that the Commonwealth gets its pound of flesh? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mason, who conducted the inquiry <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He conducted the inquiry instead of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr who went to another place -  reported to the Government in May and, as a result, consultation fees and benefits were increased in all States from 1 July 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides putting Into effect  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason’s recommendation for N.S.W., this decision of the Government represented an increase of about 6 per cent to general practitioner fees for consultations and home visits for all other States from 1 July 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate does itself no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, nor does it do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Parliament or to the electorate, when tempers become heated and matters tend to get out ot control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the money that is made available must be distributed so that it gives <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the poorer people who do not get the opportunity that the wealthy people get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only a change of government on 2nd December will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this group of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who wants to appreciate the problems which are involved in Aboriginal affinity with the land has only to read the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn in the Nabalco case to understand that Aboriginal concepts of relationship to land and affinity with land are completely different from the land use to which we as Australians have become accustomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that earlier this year I tabled a report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jenkyn of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who had spent some time in England observing the working of the new divorce ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J regarded  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Jenkyn’s report as a useful document that would assist persons who wished to engage in public debate on the merits of the English Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in May 1970  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston, as he then was, made certain recommendations in his report of his inquiry into academic salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government, after consultation with State governments, has concluded that the time is appropriate for such a review and, on 11th September 1972, the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  announced that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  W. B. Campbell of the Supreme Court of Queensland had been appointed to conduct an inquiry into academic salaries in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell will be assisted by Professor R. L. Mathews, Professor of Accounting and Public Finance of the Australian National University, and  Mr M.  C. Timbs, Executive Member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, as assessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any such increases will, of course, require a Government decision on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Campbell’s inquiry will not be examining salaries at colleges of advanced education because the Commonwealth is adhering to the principles of the Sweeney report that salaries of lecturers and senior lecturers in colleges of advanced education should be broadly the same as those in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>85 of State grants plus fees in respect of increases in academic salaries from 1st January 1973 that may be determined by Government decision as a result of the inquiry into academic salaries in universities that is being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  W. B. Campbell of the Supreme Court of Queensland, as 1 stated in my speech on the previous Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recently reviewed the progress made on the drafting of the report - which, I am happy to say, is considerable - before deciding whether it could be brought to a stage which would do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the subject and be suitable for presentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is a question of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a question of carrying out the pledges made by my Party, I indicate, as 1 did previously, that we act consistently, and we are moving to remove this excise altogether from the wine industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee firmly believes that to do otherwise would result in an unsubstantiated and ill-informed report which would do rather less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the important task with which this Committee was charged by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wilh the full support of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Government has decided that it should follow the alternative course, which is available under the Constitution, of investing State Supreme Courts and the Supreme Courts of the mainland Territories with original jurisdiction in certain additional federal matters in respect of which the High Court now exercises original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the States in additional expenditure, perhaps in the provision of further accommodation and even in further appointments to the judiciary - no doubt the Commonwealth will foot the bill - that the States were not consulted as to their preparedness to accept the whole proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Inhis 1971 report did  Sir Richard  Kirby express the urgent necessity for a new appointment of a commissioner and a further judge to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the report in August 1970 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby of vacancies in the numbers of Industrial Commissioners, were any advertisements to fill the vacancies inserted in any newspaper between 1970 and June 1972 referred to in an answer given to  Senator Cavanagh  on 14th August 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The corollary of this was not only whether <span class="highlight">justice</span> was being done or appearing to have been done, but also whether all the conciliation commissioners were fit enough to be mobile and available to settle disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate can do itself more <span class="highlight">justice</span> if in the future we deal with Estimates Committees as the Senate as a whole proposed we should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to admit that there is an element of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in what he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see how honourable senators opposite have any claim in <span class="highlight">justice</span> or equity to say that this Bill is being rushed or that it is not necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that in the process it would not be bad if just a little attempt were made to see that there was some <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I can hold out no hope whatever to the honourable senator that any kind of decency or <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be expected of that regime in view of its very much greater crimes against the majority of the population in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government begun proceedings before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in respect of such tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be pointed out that the bringing of proceedings in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to settle the legality of the tests should not be interpreted as an unfriendly act justifying any rupture of relations between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considerations of fairness, <span class="highlight">justice</span>, humanity, decency and proper administration of the law called for reform of the procedures under the rules which had been described by learned judges as being far too complex, far too costly and undignified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later  Sir Isaac  Isaacs, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court-  argued that the result of these amendments was not an absolute prohibition for altering boundaries except with the consent of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under the pressure of  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  the Democratic Labor Party and misguided senators here tonight, this problem will not be resolved until Papua New Guinea takes it to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If 4 weeks annual leave is to be granted to only some employees, lel it be granted on a basis which is understandable and which has some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no merit or <span class="highlight">justice</span> in simply saying that members of unions shall have 4 weeks annual leave and people who are not members of unions shall have only 3 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any Government supporter is prepared to assert that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that proposition, 1 am sure that not only this Senate bur the people of Australia will be interested to hear what curious collection of words can justify such discriminatory treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can just imagine the noise of protest which would resound throughout Australia about the discrimination and the lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I see it, it Should apply on an even-handed basis - equally fairly and with <span class="highlight">justice</span> right across the board throughout the public service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators opposite consider that that is <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>this respect’ presented by  .His  Honour  Mr. <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo as’ representing an across the board attitude which meant that the reserves of the funds should- absorb increasing - costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators 1 present the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore on the inquiry conducted on behalf of the Australian Government in relation to proposed steel price increases by Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd and Australian Iron and Steel Co.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no - bless your heart -  Senator Bishop  sits there, benign and complacent, representing a government which is so intent upon promoting unionism in the Public Service - a unionism to advocate the cause of the underdog, to see that public servants will get <span class="highlight">justice</span> against the repressive demands of  Senator Bishop  and his colleagues - that we need to have preference for unionism m the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the Commonwealth Government should be criticised, not for compelling a worker to join a union but for telling him: ‘If you elect not to join a union you will not get 4 weeks annual leave’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the policy speech delivered by  Mr Whitlam  last November and in the GovernorGeneral’s Speech, the need for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the ending of inequality is stressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is discrimination, not <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and just as surely it will create inequality not equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it has the hypocrisy to talk about <span class="highlight">justice</span>, equality and the ending of discrimination when its policies are aimed at and directed to achieving the opposite effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1, declares that it is highly irregular to bring into discussion, in either House of Parliament, any matters, whether they relate to criminal or civil cases, which are undergoing judicial investigation, or are about to be submitted to courts of law, as it leads to the imputation of a desire to interfere with the ordinary course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties to this dispute because this debate could have a vital effect on the matter when it goes before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I suggest to those honourable men that they themselves withdraw this motion because, after all, it is not a question of doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to any individual, whether he is a communist or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should we bring this matter before the Senate at an earlier time than normal to canvas the issues when we know the background of those issues and when <span class="highlight">justice</span> ought to be done to the persons concerned in the proper place for <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am delighted that the privilege of introducing these historic measures in this chamber - of rectifying this denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> - has fallen to me and that it is one of the first legislative acts of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This mere abolition of a confession statement has been said by the judges not to relieve them of the obligation to consider whether ornot the fact is proved, as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of South Australia,  Dr Bray,  said in February of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In every jurisdiction of Australian Courts, even in petty sessions and bankruptcy jurisdiction - it has been the universal practice for Court fees to be payable as some contribution by litigants to the cost of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If 2 spouses each have property valued at $30,000 and the husband commits adultery and the wife is put to the cost of getting a divorce from him, in the name of God and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, what principle, except arrogant irrationality, deprives the wife, the petitioner, of the right to recover the cost of that legal process against the husband who has committed adultery? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief Judge in Divorce of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, said in evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Joske, a distinguished and famous authority on marriage and divorce, in remarks which he made and has authorised me to use, referred to ‘complicated legal procedures brought about by top-heavy divorce rules’ and advised: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bray has referred to the ‘cumbersome, prolix and expensive procedure’ under the former Rules and concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Else Mitchell of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in a memorandum to me as Attorney-General on divorce reform, said of the previous Rules: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our understanding that the aim of the law is to provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> for both parties but, hopefully, this could be achieved with greater expedition and simplicity and with a consequent reduction of the anxiety many people suffer during that period between their separation from their spouse and the legal dissolution of their marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Burbury of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, in a letter submitted to the Senate Committee, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Carmichael, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in the case of Hutton v.

    <p>The need for such reform was referred to by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Selby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> ElseMitchell of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in his memorandum to me on divorce reform, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, in answer to a question by  Senator Durack,  quoted Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Burbury, who pointed out that the sanction ‘has no teeth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby said of the sanction: ‘To that extent it is quite useless’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, in his memorandum, described the sanction as ‘an empty formality’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for reforms of this nature was referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, who, in speaking of claims for damages in the course of his evidence before the Senate Committee, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unnecessary joinder of adulterers was dealt with in evidence before the Committee by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The desirability of removing third parties from matrimonial causes was referred to in the recommendations to the Senate Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association in terms of reducing costs, bitterness, technical problems and grave injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Watson  Q.C., on behalf of that body, endorsed the evidence of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby and supported the solution offered, saying of the former provisions: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imperative need for this reform was asserted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby in the course of  His  Honour’s evidence before the Senate Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Else Mitchell, in his memorandum to me, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to a remedial system adopted in New South Wales for assessing costs in a manner similar to that adopted by the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Barry in the Supreme Court of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, in his memorandum to me on divorce reform, suggested as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that I speak here tonight and I support the motion for disallowance because I believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and because I believe that what is being done is a grave injustice, firstly, to this Parliament and to the principles of law making by this Parliament; and, secondly, to the community, the people who are forced to proceed under these regulations, to the judges who are sitting and to the members of the legal profession who are administering these regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test is: Has <span class="highlight">justice</span> been done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 invite the Senate, to realise that when a petition is served on a respondent today - male or female - that respondent has absolutely no knowledge, except by a couple of staccato words, what the ground for divorce will be and is denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an absolute denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> if that information is not supplied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him test this by one thing: Does this provide natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any judge sitting at this moment in matrimonial causes under the Act should in conscience consider what Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bray said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bray said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, one of the very learned judges, a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, has said, and said lately - yet the Attorney-General would say that everyone is supporting him; that the angels are on his side  -  ‘I am administering an Act under which I have to make a discretionary judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Fact, this is what Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bray has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the kind of principle, the kind of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we are being taught. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the corruption of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have said that I believe that once we are sure that there is an irretrievable, very tragic, breakdown of a marriage we should try to bring dignity, to act with speed consistent with <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to reduce costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the Government to take action by amending the principal Act to bring about the natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> which the rules deny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, he said: ‘I oppose these rules because I believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether he was suggesting that we on this side of the chamber believe in injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I will use one, and it is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Murphy  has said, the people who have given evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, including the Chief Judge in Divorce in New South Wales,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, have said, amongst other things, that the discretion statement is such an abomination and such a blot on our law that it cannot disappear too soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby said that it should be thrown out immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the criticisms of the other rules strike me as pettifogging lawyers’ objections, nitpicking objections, objections that do not go to any fundamental question of human <span class="highlight">justice</span>, or human rights, or humanity or compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in the interests of proper administration of the law and of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, he took the trouble to write 2 articles in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ in the middle of last month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Murphy  has made great play in his speech tonight, as he has done in answering questions in this Senate, of the views expressed by the Chief Judge in Divorce in New South Wales,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, who was the first witness and, I suppose, the most distinguished witness to appear before the Senate Standing Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For once in this Senate  Senator Murphy  has correctly quoted the evidence of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, who advocated the splitting of the hearing of the claim for principal relief from the hearing of the claim for what is known as ancillary relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby’s view was that this was the former practice of the courts and that it would be a more satisfactory form of administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We put to  Mr Watson  the view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby never at any time advocated that at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The draftsman of these rules, whoever he was - as I said I am sure he was not the Parliamentary Draftsman or anybody of any capacity in the Attorney-General’s Department - did not understand for one minute what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and other lawyers oppose separate hearings for the principal relief and matters relating to custody, maintenance and matrimonial property, but there is no doubt that some of the strongest evidence which was given to the Constitutional and Legal Committee on this matter was given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, the Chief Judge in Divorce of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Selby was quite adamant that one essential reform was the separation of the hearings for principal relief and ancillary relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Little doubts  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby’s logic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think most people who have some knowledge of the law regard  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby as being a very logical judge, a man of great erudition with a very sound grasp not only of logic but also of the questions relating to divorce which come before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator James  McClelland has suggested that this would imply a very long and undue delay and that injustice could he caused thereby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why this Committee, while having before it the whole question of divorce, and having taken already extensive evidence, should not give priority to this segment of the investigation once this matter is referred to it, bring in an early report and then Government action in pursuance of that interim report dealing with this segment, if it is approved by the Senate and accepted by the Government, could proceed without undue delay; and therefore in a regular and proper way, by legislation and not by regulation, the whole matter could be resolved to the satisfaction of those who are concerned with the proper application of rules in the proper fashion and those who are determined to see that matrimonial <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be available and will be done at the minimum cost to those who are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 1971 proposals, arrived at after the inquiry of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, were not implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1971,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr proposed that the salary should be $13,000 and that there should be a further review soon after the next general election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount proposed is $4,100 - the amount recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr for country electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr proposed that these amounts should be raised to $13,300 and $9,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended that the Prime Ministerial salary should be raised to $27,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the special allowance for Ministers is concerned, the legislation now before the Senate basically applies  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth - if my recollection is correct - and other distinguished members of the legal profession consulted with legal experts throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be my view that it ought to sit about 2 years after the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some of us - you,  Mr Deputy President  are one - represent a State in the Senate which is bigger than most of the House of Representatives electorates combined.I think that at least the Senate has achieved some form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were to make some criticism of the other parts of the Bill, I would make the criticism I made to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anybody on our side quarrels with the quantum that is to be paid to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court and the others in judicial offices or to the Permanent Heads of departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for which the Labor Party stands? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be supporting the Bill, but we hope that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was about to illustrate the use made in December 1971 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, as he then was, as a figure to be accepted by all Australia as being of complete independence and judicial quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we did on this occasion, after taking the Kerr report as a base for many things, was to come up with a figure which we believed took into account everything - the decision by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, the cost of living, the relativity of these salaries to those of other people - and above all was a fair amount to pay to members of Parliament for the work that they are expected to do and which will encourage desirable types to fill our shoes as one by one we go out of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in all those cases  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr kept the amounts substantially below the amounts to be paid to the  Deputy  Leader of the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr did not put forward the same argument as  Senator Drake-Brockman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has done better than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is my understanding that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr allowed for such a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could never see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of that difference and  I  am glad to see it eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr worked on it for about  10  weeks and still came up looking for an inquiry at the end of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the old Bill, had it been passed, and accepting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr’s report, senior Ministers would have received $13,300 and junior Ministers $9,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, Q.C, has been appointed as Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner to report on the most effective means of implementing this decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently an inquiry was set up under a very able judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how any Attorney-General with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a respect for human values could have taken a different view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a limitation on <span class="highlight">justice</span> and legal rights - a limitation determined by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one man has a monopoly of truth or <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> and civil rights are not enhanced by the Attorney-General’s tabling documents in this Parliament whereby people are named as associated with activities which we deplore when he has not taken any action to have the persons so named arrested and charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only decision that can be made is made by the Minister for Immigration on the advice of many organs of government and we will be proceeding with <span class="highlight">justice</span> and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor pointed out in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory on Monday, 26th March 1973, in relation to the deportation of a Yugoslav relating to a criminal offence that the departmental summary provided from one of these organs of government was at variance in some cases with the finding of the judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a position of great responsibility because it is the pivotal point for the administration of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the rule of law and the tradition of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>, upheld by the Attorney-General in the prosecution of crime and by the courts in the adjudication of cases, that distinguish our system from the systems of totalitarianism and authoritarianism which  Senator Murphy  demonstrated so lamentably when he raided the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation with his praetorian guard of Commonwealth police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point about his duty is that he guards the documents so that they will be used only in the courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not merely an abuse of the evidence that  Senator Murphy  has obtained from the police, used for parliamentary and political purposes and not for the courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and the invasion of ASIO but also the spectacle of plain misrepresentation, distortion of facts and suppression of material files when he came to compose that statement to which we listened last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Attorney-General worth his salt has ever responded to questions when his answers would tell the Parliament what was contained in a police file relating to an investiga tion that was still being developed for the purpose of producing evidence for courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood,  when asked a question as to whether he had evidence, answered in the term that truly represents evidence, that is to say, evidence admissible in a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, evidence of a cogency that would persuade a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the person accused was rightly accused and should be convicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A principle of British and Australian <span class="highlight">justice</span> has always been that people are innocent until they are found guilty, but on this occasion in this Parliament, under privilege, the Croatian people as a group and certain individuals have been declared guilty without trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had hoped that honourable senators with any sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and those with some training in the law - like  Senator Rae  who is continuing to interject - would deal with the issues and answer them before putting forward a proposition like the one we are debating tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our system of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which  Senator Wright  spoke about last night and which is something, of which we are proud, requires proof beyond doubt of an offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost inconceivable that a man actuated by <span class="highlight">justice</span>, rectitude, honesty, integrity, probity and all the other qualities that should be the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always accepted the adage of jurisprudence that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but must also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this the sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the champions of law and order will hand out when evidence is placed before them that people throw bombs into buildings and commit acts of violence and are allowed to go scot free? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the recommendation of the so-called Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in New South Wales no bill was filed against a person involved because he represented the same right wing terrorist groups that the Government which  Senator Webster  supports has been seeking to protect for a great number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to make the observation that honourable senators do themselves less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> and put themselves in offence against the Standing Orders when they quote from a newspaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ‘our country’ in this document is not Australia but Croatia -  is suffering and groaning in the fetters of SerboCommunist thraldom, a handful of uncompromising and fanatical Croatian patriots have formed the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood; they were guided in their effort by the pure and decent idea of giving allout support to the liberation of the Croatian people and to the establishment of a sovereign state of Croatia, based on the principles of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as so splendidly expounded in the Fundamental Principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Maddison, the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for New South Wales, in accordance with that resolution of the Standing Committee formally requested Professor Morison to make a report in accordance with the resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, it was arranged between the New South Wales Department of AttorneyGeneral and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Professor Morison that the initial phase of the inquiry by Professor Morison should consist in a review of the relevant published literature, the information sent to Professor Morison on an unsolicited basis and the files in the possession of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was further arranged that Professor Morison should, at the completion of this initial phase, forward to the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> a memorandum for the purpose of enabling him to consider what extension of the form of inquiry might be justified in the light of the circumstances then appearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am saying is that the abolitionists do not do their cause any <span class="highlight">justice</span> by saying that the United States Supreme Court by a majority held that the death penalty was unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That example alone leads me to think that, if we are to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only to this favoured class of beneficiary but to the other classes to whom I have referred and to other people in the community, further consideration has to be given to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a vague recollection that during the term of the previous Government  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wallace was commissioned by the Government to inquire into and report upon the tourist potential of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I should like to think that we live in a society that can still be described as a society where Christianity prevails and, according to that doctrine, there is a greater dispensation than <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and that is grace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government recognises that adjustments which are made to wages by the body set up and recognised by previous governments and this Government - I refer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission - to give wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who are at the bottom end of the economic scale ought not to be decried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a limit - I think ajustifiable limit - to the amount that the Government could give to any industry as a whole and therefore the amounts which were made available should have been on the basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who would suffer the greatest disability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether one quotes the fictitious figure of 6 per cent for America and .02 per cent for Sweden, or whatever the figure is, if we surrender the right to defend the community, after <span class="highlight">justice</span> and after mercy, against the ultimate criminal murderer, society just becomes cottonwool weakness unable to exert itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all the honourable senator said that  Senator Murphy  asked for deferment of this matter now sought to be raised by  Senator Gair,  and of which  Senator Gair  gave notice only yesterday afternoon, for a period of 10 days until  Senator Murphy  returns from The Hague where he will represent Australia at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to put Australia’s case against France’s desire to carry out nuclear experiments in the Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gair in the early stages of this debate said that he was accommodating an early presentation of this motion to the convenience of  Senator Murphy  who finds himself faced with important business of an international character concerning Australia before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be done prior to the return to Australia of  Senator Murphy  following his presentation of Australia’s case to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am inclined to think that an attempt is being made to discredit Australia’s representative who is to present the case for the Australian people before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against the French nuclear tests which will be held in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had asked that it be delayed because the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  is to represent Australia before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can get on to this question - I hope I am appealing to the responsible members of the Opposition - I point out that we have to consider in this question whether we should seek to set up a committee for the purpose of attempting to discredit our representative who will appear before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> simply because some honourable senators do not think that the deaths that may occur as a result of the French nuclear explosion in the Pacific are as important as the privacy of some Croatians which may have been invaded by the raid by Commonwealth police, on their homes on that particular night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite all the melodrama , of  Senator O’Byrne,  let nobody suggest, that what is sought by the motion for this inquiry would in any way militate against meting out full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to any person in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a quaint circumstance,  Mr President,  that those who talk, purity while in Opposition, those who see things clearly with the pure eye of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, while in Opposition, turn to corrupt the principle when in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  and members of the Australian Labor Party recommended that a Senate committee should be used because they said that there was no more shining instrument of truth, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and factual information than a standing or select committee of this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this information must be freely and immediately available, from the Minister’s advisers and because its nature cannot possibly prejudice the Government’s approach to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, will the Minister make it available either now or prior to his departure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General agree that he and the Australian Government have possibly made a very grave error of judgment in that he has got the Government to agree that Australia should make an approach to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague concerning nuclear testing when, on his own admission, the Attorney-General - the chief law officer of Australia - is unable to say whether the Government accepts the jurisdiction of the Court, whether it will be bound by the Court’s decision and whether it accepts the other aspects which were put to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following his recent appeal to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in The Hague against the proposed French nuclear tests in the Pacific, will he be making a similar appeal to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against the proposed Chinese nuclear tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to answer questions, especially oral questions, on this matter on the eve of the case being presented to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to which the subject matter of the questions relate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I find it singularly inappropriate - I will say no more-p-that honourable senators on the Opposition side should be asking questions about a matter of this kind which is to come before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on behalf of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this will do full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">justice</span> of such an amendment is obvious, and I find it difficult to understand why the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, next week, get up there and start to move some more of your motions, irrespective of the facts, circumstances, <span class="highlight">justice</span>, truth, numbers, conventions, traditions or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to your credit that you have not lent yourself to this campaign to deny <span class="highlight">justice</span>, rights and equality of opportunity to every member of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of the Supreme Court of New Zealand is at present in Australia at the invitation of the Government to conduct an inquiry for the purpose of reporting upon the relative practicability of establishing workers compensation, road accident compensation and other injury compensation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the proceedings pf this inquiry been made known to the various State governments and is there any attempt to interest them in co-ordinating any proposals they have, especially in respect of workers compensation and road accident compensation, for submission to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to the question directed to me by  Senator Wright,  acting in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, I understand that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of the New Zealand Supreme Court is in Australia at the invitation of the Australian Government for the purpose of assisting the holding of an inquiry with a view to reporting to the Government upon workers compensation, road accident compensation, third party compensation and other injury compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not say whether there has been any attempt on the part of the Minister for Social Security to prevail upon  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse to coordinate proposals that might come from the States from time to time on these matters, but I will refer the honourable senator’s question and suggestion to my colleague for his consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question relates to the plea which was made by the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate that discussion of certain important matters be held over until the return of  Senator Murphy  who is representing Australia at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the People’s Republic of China accepted the jurisdiction of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, should the statement referred to by  Senator Carrick  that China intends proceeding with a nuclear testing program prove to be correct, will the Australian Government take this matter to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> with the object of preventing these tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these studies the Government’s aim will be  to  create conditions for the achievement of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and industrial harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the task of the national Parliament to create labour relations which meet and match the needs of the community and which will anticipate and overcome obstacles to <span class="highlight">justice</span> and common sense in industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, before he left the Bench to become Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, carried out a major inquiry into pay and conditions in the armed services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo is now acting as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Fiji and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston is engaged on duties connected with the administration of the Trade Practices Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has accepted their views and the Bill provides that new presidential members who are eligible for judicial appointment will be granted the title ‘<span class="highlight">Justice</span>*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that this nation should be aware of the fact that the Labor Party is not concerned with electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has received electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the past 23 years when it has ended up in Opposition, which is where it belongs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it wants to do is to give this nation electoral injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the United States Supreme Court, in delivering the opinion of the Court in the case of Reynolds v. Sims in June 1964, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been deeply moved by the expressions that I have heard from honourable senators opposite in favour of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always understood, and it has been made very clear to me, that when a question of electoral reform arises the attitude of all parties has been not ‘Is it electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not impressed one bit by al] the hypocrisy about this Bill being electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP, in what it has put forward, is not motivated by any ideas of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> or fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this country there is no such thing as devotion to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nobody with any desire to achieve electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our friend says it is in the Constitution, but does not the Government believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 come to the question of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the system which would really give us electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not want electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to this matter of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I am strongly on the side of 2 Ministers in the present Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they are on the right tram and I honour them because they realise that what is being put in this Bill is not electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and they want electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Mr Cameron  has a lot of common sense and that he believes in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that there is no electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the single electorate system and that the DLP policy of proportional representation is the only system which gives electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A couple of years ago the Victorian ALP appointed a committee to find out what system would give electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here the committee’s report which says that electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> cannot be achieved under a singlemember electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only the quota-preferential method comes anywhere near satisfying the criterion of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all electors,  whereunder  their right can be realised to cast a useful vote that takes part in the election of a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report says that there is no electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> with a single-member system and it says that in the committee’s belief electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be achieved only under a proportional representation system, and that view agrees with the views expressed by  Mr Clyde  Cameron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that  Senator Mulvihill  is against electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill  is against electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a fairminded committee which had a look at this situation and it said: ‘If you want electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> wipe out the single-member electoral system and bring in the quota-preferential system*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under those circumstances, all the talk about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is guff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Government is not interested in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and it is not interested in electoral fairplay; all it is interested in is a system which will prevent people it does not like from getting any representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So honourable senators opposite should not cry all over the floor about parliamentary electoral systems which will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> because they do not believe in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in conclusion that since the matter of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been raised by the Government - it says this is a vote on electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> - we are unable to vote for this Bill because on the evidence that I have presented it does not give electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we will vote against the Bill, and tomorrow we will give consideration at our Party meeting to moving an amendment which will ask the Senate to establish the principle which is set out in these documents that proportional representation does give electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>.I seek leave,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  to table the documents to which I have referred, namely, the report of the committee of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party, the statement by  Mr Clyde  Cameron and the report of the mathematics masters who have examined the different systems of voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not even give real <span class="highlight">justice</span> to their own supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a situation in which the movement of population to the city areas is increasing requires a loading in favour of country people.- The loading cannot alter to any major degree the balance of the parties, except insofar as country people accept the policies of the Country Party to a greater degree than they accept the policies of the other 2 parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is necessary in order to achieve electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I do not blink At that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus made great play of his desire for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course all speakers from the Opposition side spoke with varying degrees of sincerity and conviction in the name of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They found nothing inconsistent with their love of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the maintenance of the status quo as far as the Electoral Act is concerned, so let us look briefly at some examples of the electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we have under this status quo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that we should stick to the 20 per cent permissible variation from the quota and in that way we will get greater electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> than by having a redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite who claim that they are interested in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that they are interested in one vote one value but can defend those discrepancies are either blind or very, very insincere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those inevitabilities are that the rural population, in proportion to the city population, is dwindling and that there is no reason in terms of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> why its representation in the Parliament should not dwindle accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In itself, it is not aimed at delivering electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in the famous cases which were recently before Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren, as in Wesberry v. Sanders in 1964, the meaning of ‘as nearly as practicable’ was interpreted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see how little regard the Liberal-Country Party governments in those States had for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, of course we do not, because over the years they have shown themselves to be completely unconcerned about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a lot of poppycock for  Senator Carrick  to talk about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the rights of the voters, the rights of rural communities and the rights of people when he turns a blind eye to gerrymanders of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators opposite maintain that that action was taken for the purpose of further^ ing electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were  Senator Neil  O’sullivan;  Senator Wright,  to whom I have referred;  Mr Alec  Downer, who was a Minister for Immigration in the Menzies Government and later High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom; and  Mr Joske,  Q.C., as he was at that time, but who is now  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know what the lawyers have based their case on to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to date, as far as I am aware, the Government of the day has always had a majority of members of those committees, and if the Opposition felt that it had not received <span class="highlight">justice</span> on any committee it could always submit a minority report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He knows, if he read the second reading speech properly, that the purpose of the Bill is to create electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> so far as the Federal Parliament is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot be a servant to myself and have a business, and also do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people who pay me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I congratulate  Mr Steele  Hall, the South Australian Premier at the time, for at least having thought that some <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be given to the electors in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quoting the principle that by the introduction of this legislation we are endeavouring to bring about some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they again refuse to pass the legislation which seeks to give some electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian people, as has been said by the Leader of our Party,  Mr Whitlam,  and by many Government Ministers, the Parties opposite will be called on to face the electors and to face the consequences which will follow from their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With those few remarks, I give my full support to the Bill and the measures it contains which seek to give some electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It intends by this legislation, firstly, to eliminate some of the provisions which attempted to bring equality of voting to people who did not have that equality when viewed in the light of great distances that they had to travel to have communication with their member of Parliament, the difficulties caused by sparseness of population in the great area of an electorate and the difficulty of an elected member of Parliament in giving <span class="highlight">justice</span>, fair consideration and representation to some of those people who lived in the great outback areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been deeply moved by the expressions I have heard from honourable senators opposite in favour of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always understood, and it has been made very clear to me, that when a question of electoral reform arises the attitude of all parties has been not ‘It is electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>”? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is a question of who will win, but we can argue <span class="highlight">justice</span> on this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government reaffirms its strong support for the ILO and its wide-ranging activities concerned with the promotion of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally it has stressed the relationship between social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and peace - ‘universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on issues vital to proposed legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where before has there been the backing of one of his brother justices, who fully agreed with the sentiments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia then said, in part:  11 is quite clear historically, if one examines the descriptions of the territory placed under governorship, that the territory of the original colony of New South Wales except as to certain islands of the Pacific did not extend beyond low water mark . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone wishes to take the matter further, there are the views expressed by no less tha.i the former  President  of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Percy  Spender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude on this note: This is not a matter for long argument, but I think that the Senate does not do itself <span class="highlight">justice</span> by deferring it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy for any honourable senator, no matter to which Party he belongs, on occasions to talk about the thirst for liberty and the thirst for <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When 1 looked .it some of the documents that  Senator McManus  tabled in the Senate there was a recurring theme among a number of people concerned who were crying out for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and questioning quite mistakenly the attitude of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One or two of them said that they were concerned about <span class="highlight">justice</span> and about their Australian rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a very memorable day in the case of Srecko Rover, with all his search for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if he appears one day before a group of senators and has to tell us why his passport was taken from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean an addition to ‘an Australian diplomatic or consular officer, a judge of a court, magistrate, <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace of that country or a notary public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is in addition to an authorised celebrant, a commissioner for declarations or a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could be a problem in some countries, but the same situation would arise if we were trying to identify a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From experience it has been considered that this provision ought to be extended beyond the scope of a diplomat, a consular officer, a judge, a magistrate, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and a notary public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With  Senator Murphy  presenting a case to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in The Hague on French nuclear tests and the rights and protection of humanity, can the Minister say whether the AttorneyGeneral will be returning home via Yugoslavia in order to have discussions with the heads of Government in that country on the rights and protection of Australian citizens in Yugoslavia and, further, to ascertain whether any Australians are being held in custody there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  I  have said several times, we will hear the whole of the anti Australian case at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> from honourable Senators opposite if we sit here long enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have people in this chamber for ever trying to denigrate and pull down the case which we are putting before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Parliament of the State of Tasmania records its support for moves by the Federal Government to prevent the planned nuclear tests by the French Government in the South Pacific area and to refer this important matter to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at the Hague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was Professor O’Connell’s advice, I believe, which was responsible for Australia, New Zealand and Fiji relying on the 1928 General Act for the pacific settlement of international disputes, in bringing their dispute in this matter to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where it has been able to do so by the invocation of a particular treaty the Government has proceeded against the Republic of France in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any event, it is the subject matter of consideration by the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, in itself, based on a corrupt principle - a principle that a group of people, without any necessary skills, can arrive at decisions arbitrarily and then publish those decisions without there being any appeal, and can in fact blackmail retailers and manufacturers without there being any recourse to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that this is the Government which paid lip service to freedom, the liberty of the individual, the right of the individual to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to set up an arbitrary tribunal such as this, then I do not know the meaning of the words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ensures complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all States, big and small alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Percy  Spender when Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: lt is quite clear historically, if one examines the description of the territory placed under governorship, the territory of the original colony of New South Wales except as to certain islands of the Pacific did nol extend beyond the low water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Opposition senators can be charged with obstructing the course of political <span class="highlight">justice</span>, or back-tracking on their clearly expressed views over a number of years and of succumbing to the pressures of State governments which, on so many questions, do not see the national interest in perspective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the State governments are doing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Clause 1 be postponed as an instruction to the Government: that the further consideration of the Bill be deferred until after the general inquiry into National Rehabilitation and Compensation by the Committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse has reported - and further that the inquiry should take into account - social service benefits for invalidity; social service benefits for widowhood; repatriation benefits; road traffic compensation; workers’ compensation; and  the need to cover self-employed persons and housewives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would seem to us to be possibly so out of touch with reality and with what the community can provide, with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all sections pf the community, that the matter requires reconsideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words ‘<span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace’ have been substituted for the word ‘magistrate’ on the, basis that magistrates are hard to find except in large centres of population but that justices ot the peace occur fairly freely throughout the country side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives and the Minister have suggested that these words be substituted: a  warrant from a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace authorising him to enter upon the land, being a warrant granted after the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has been satisfied, by information on oath, that it is impracticable so to notify the occupier of the land within a reasonable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps can the Government take to protest against this breach of ethics by France in defiance of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> deliberations and world public opinion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the precise information which the honourable senator has just given to me, but he will be aware, as all of us are, that Australia took a case to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in regard to the proposed French nuclear tests and that that Court is still deliberating upon Australia’s application for interim measures to prevent the French for continuing with any tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That clause 1 be postponed as an instruction to the Government: that the further consideration of the Bill be deferred until after the general inquiry into National Rehabilitation and Compensation by the Committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse has reported - and further that the inquiry should take into account - social service benefits for invalidity; social service benefits for widowhood; repatriation benefits; road traffic compensation; workers’ compensation; and the need to cover self-employed persons and housewives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there should be social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity in the approach taken to compensating various sectors of the community, all of whom are entitled to consideration from the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the very essence of the investigation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and his report will cover it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that before the pace making step provided by this Bill is taken there should be consideration of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and what is practical for the whole community and at what levels various types of compensation should be struck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that social <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires it and therefore we shall proceed as indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case put by  Senator Rae  which is based on the fact that there will be an inquiry which has been approved by the Government which decided the terms of reference for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse, simply seeks to defer the whole question for many months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is proceeding under the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, the other under the Chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose will make his report - he will make it in his own good, competent time - but he will shortly go overseas to make further investigations related to the representations that have been made to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be pertinent to say that we should look at the general levels of workers compensation when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and the relevant committees to which honourable senators opposite have referred and in which they are interested - the inquiry into repatriation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and the inquiries by the Senate committees - have presented their reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why we Opposition senators are taking the point of view we are taking is that we are determined to make social <span class="highlight">justice</span> equitably available to all classes and just as firmly to deny unjustified privilege, to a class of servants on whom we have the capacity and the opportunity to confer privileges because of the enormous revenue that is available to the Commonwealth Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We instituted a review under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and some of us had to fight to get even that for Vietnam casualties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before then, it would have been half that amount, lt is a blatant, rude deprival of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to bring in a provision whereby the widows of public servants can receive $15,000 or $20,000 a year for the rest of their lives while the widows of men who were killed in the First and Second World wars and in other wars are left on midget pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was considering compensation on this comprehensive basis in New Zealand in 1968 he felt able to recommend a weekly payment, but in no case whatever to exceed $120 a week, which is about $7,000 a year, and in no case whatever to exceed 80 per cent of the earned salary or wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that demonstrates that the generality of people in this country are entitled to be brought into consideration by this Parliament to ensure that the system of compensation for personal injury will entitle them at least to a measure of compensation which will not suffer when subjected to considerations of <span class="highlight">justice</span> by comparison with the Commonwealth Public Servict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Bishop  stated that an inquiry was made into repatriation in the time when my Party was in office 18 months ago by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and also by a Senate Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the notion that it is only a matter of waiting until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and those assisting him have concluded their inquiries, and that then this Senate will be able to go on with consideration of this Bill, is just not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An  application was made in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the proposals regarding university fees and age pensions are significantly costly to the public revenue and the saving to revenue by the means test on state aid comparatively small, is not such a means test wholly discriminatory and totally unjustifiable in terms of revenue saving or social <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, Australia could seek - as it has done, but the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has not yet given its judgment - to invoke a particular General Act as well as general provisions of the United Nations Charter in respect of what had been done by the Republic of France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to enter further into a matter which is still awaiting decision by the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to precisely what steps ought to be taken, firstly, these would depend on what may be said by the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on the whole question of atmospheric nuclear testing; and secondly, the steps actually to be taken are matters of policy for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill proposes amendments to the appeals provisions of the income tax law to transfer to the State Supreme Courts the jurisdiction of single justices of the High Court in income tax appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a pressing need to relieve the High Court, so far as possible, of the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By far the greater volume of work presented in the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> jurisdiction of the High Court consists of income tax appeals, either appeals brought directly from a commissioner’s decision or from a decision of a board of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principally, these will permit the High Court to remit to a Supreme Court any of the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> income tax matters which have come to it under the present law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although some of the Opposition speakers have taken sideswipes at the substance of the Bill, the pith and substance of  Senator Rae’s  motion is that further consideration of the Bill be deferred until after the presentation of the report of the general inquiry into national rehabilitation and compensation by the committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are, as may be anticipated from the well-known views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse who is presiding over this inquiry, to receive from the Committee a recommendation for a new concept of egalitarianism in compensa tion for personal injury, involving perhaps necessarily, if we are to follow the New Zealand example, the abolition of the right of private insurance companies to play any role in this field we can anticipate a long drawn out debate between ourselves and the Opposition on the merits of such a recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether Opposition senators, including  Senator Wright  and  Senator Rae,  who have spoken in the debate have considered the full implications of the scheme adopted in New Zealand following the inquiry conducted there under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is relevant to note that in 1968  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse recommended  for New Zealand compensation representing 80 per cent of earnings with an upper limit of $120 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and his committee also recommended the abolition of the common law tort of negligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have, pointed out, inherent in a scheme such as the one  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse recommended for New Zealand, is the elimination of the role of the private insurance companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Clause 1 be postponed - as an instruction to the Government that the further consideration of the Bill be deferred until after the general inquiry into National Rehabilitation and Compensation by the Committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse has reported . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it would be unwise, imprudent and unjust to defer indefinitely all the other provisions of the Bill until the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse is experienced in this field having conducted a similar inquiry in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole objection to the extravagant benefits to be provided to high salaried officers under this Bill is that as a matter of comparative <span class="highlight">justice</span> they are outrageous in relation to those provided to repatriation pensioners, private industry employees, self employed persons and the other sections of the community to which I referred the other day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Senate that when the Bill comes forward in a much more acceptable form, doing equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> over the whole body of the workers of Australia and not prejudicing a great number of them to the undue advantage of others, it will receive the support of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General will be reminded that a few weeks ago I referred to the inquiry being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of New Zealand, with a request that consideration be given to coordinating the inquiry that he is undertaking with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares with proposals that have been made by State governments for nofault insurance and other forms of compensation on a very restricted level for personal injury accidents on the roadway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will he take the earliest opportunity to persuade State governments which have proposals in this personal injury field to co-ordinate with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse’s inquiry so that the inquiry will cover the various classes of workers compensation, compensation for road accidents and accidents by negligence, social service compensation for invalidity and repatriation for war caused disabilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will bring the matters raised by the honourable senator to the attention of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and the other people conducting the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the action of the employers, the fixing of a day for hearing by the Industrial Court and an appreciation of the consequences of that action that brought a group of unions which had been recalcitrant of a period of 2 months to the point at which they were prepared to accept the mediation, outside the legislation, of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, who recently retired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To show how clearly those who conceived the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission regarded that as a vital provision of the Bill I’ will quote what was said by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins in .the High Court in 1917. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins is revered on all sides of industry for his terrific contribution to the cause of arbitration and industrial peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you reflect upon the disruption that those strikes caused to many sections of the community you see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of requiring some enforcement of payment in recompense for that loss which is inflicted on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far from putting its efforts to preventing trade disputes and, when they occur, channelling them to the peaceful decision of the Arbitration Commission, the Government now in 1973 with the genius of Gough Whitlam, guided by Cairns and a few others who ought to know better, and a whole crowd following them who, of course, do not understand that they are simply’ being manipulated by extreme communist disruptionists, npt only wants to neutralise the remedies’ under the arbitration system but wants also to give to the trade union organisation, its officers and members a special privilege that Austraiian organisations, officers and members have never had - a privilege to be erected here 70 years after the commencement of the arbitration system, that system being designed specifically to bring the unions into the field where the framework of law would give them advantages and impose corresponding responsibilities, and in which the whole community would work according to a system of law and order; in the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins: ‘A new province of law and order’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to the eternal credit of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore that he got the parties together, even in spite of the fact that  Senator Greenwood  and his colleague the Honourable Phil Lynch went along to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and grovelled  -  I repeat grovelled -in front of the ACTU Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances it would seem to me to be the barest elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> that such a man should have his costs borne by his union provided it is not a frivolous attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government can produce all the legislation in the world but if it has not got that prime condition, that is, people on both sides who want industrial peace and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it will not get industrial peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator James  McClelland pointed out,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, who is I suppose our main inspirer of the arbitration system today, said that sanctions do not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Lynch,  in his speech on the motion for the second reading of this Bill in the House of Representatives, spelled out in full his understanding of the functions of ILO and the general adherence of the Opposition to this peculiar but quite successful tripartite organisation of governmental members, employer members and employee members which over 50 years has been seeking to promote the ends of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this working man’s livelihood is adversely affected by this allegation, will the Minister check it and if it is found to be incorrect make a withdrawal before the Senate rises, as this course would seem to be the only one consonant with honour and <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After years of endeavouring to get <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the Aborigines thought that the only way to achieve their ends was to come here and put their embassy right in front of Parliament House and stay there until their problems were understood and some attention was paid to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is to try to give some measure of equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> and to simplify the scheme by making a percentage contribution of actual salary instead of a system of units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Everingham  or persons acting in his interests have purported to relate his account of the events which led to the withdrawal of his pass, and as a serious question of whether <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done arises on the relating of those facts, will you,  Sir, lay  on the table of the Senate the documents available to you and to  Mr Speaker  and on which, for your part, your decision was made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will make certain extensions of benefits to surviving widowers of female members of the Parliament, a proposition with which I think in <span class="highlight">justice</span> we must agree, and also provides for extended benefits such as portability to those who come from other Parliaments and it provides benefits to some members already on superannuation who have married or remarried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always appeared to me in relation to both this fund and other funds that this is a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>3) reveal that this Bill provides that income tax appeals, now falling within the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> jurisdiction of the High Court of Australia only, will come within the jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Garfield  Barwick, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia, said that it is not for the Commissioner to entertain dissatisfaction in cases of this kind merely because a taxpayer has sought to produce a set of facts which when they exist entitle him under the statute to benefits in the assessment of income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think its assists the development of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or people’s understanding of the law of the courts to have 2 systems of courts existing side by side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since this information must be freely and immediately available from the Attorney-General’s advisers and since its nature cannot possibly prejudice the Government’s approach to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, will he make this information available either now or prior to his departure from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to a decision which has been discussed by the Senate this afternoon and this evening which can only be described as a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the greatest and most reprehensible leak in political history occurred in the premature leaking of a decision of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With your permission,  Mr Deputy President,  I read the statement of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague, which is a very proper body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Court said that it considered any publication concerning a future decision of the Court, domestic or international, is incompatible with the fundamental principles governing the good administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remain with the remainder of my statement but 1 draw your attention to the fact that the Australian Press published the fact and the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> reported upon what it called the premature statement by the Prime Minister on the judgment of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the proposals regarding university fees and age pensions are significantly costly to the public revenue and the saving to revenue by the means test on state aid comparatively small, is not such a means test wholly discriminatory and totally unjustifiable in terms of revenue saving or social <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I reject the argument that social <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that the Australian Government should make contributions at a uniform rate towards the running costs of all non-government schools in a situation in which the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission has found that ‘if all non-systemtic non-government schools are pooled recurrent resource use ranges through a scale of 40 to 270 against an average of :100 for the combined six State government systems in 1972 and a target of 135 to .140 for 1979’ (paragraph 6.46 Interim Committee Report). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(2) (3) and (4) The actions of Australian citizens and organisations have to be understood in the light of the situation that has been created by the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric nuclear tests in open disregard of a ruling of the world’s highest judicial tribunal, the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  am able to tell you,  Mr President,  and honourable senators that  I  was able to recommend to the Government, in the light of the approaches now being taken to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, particularly the requirements of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that the decision given in 1942 should not be allowed to stand today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is gratifying to know that the long pursuit of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been successful and that the Governor-General has upheld the appeal, if one may call it that in simple terms, after some 21 years of struggle by Lieutenant Reid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the Government of Australia is engaged in litigation with the Government of France in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Newton in the Supreme Court of Victoria this has cost $2,087 a week or something of the order of $108,000 for the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in a case like that <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be done only by meting out the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are abolishing the only method by which <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be meted out to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing that I think that I would be meting out <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the only way in which it could be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great desire to do away with what I believe is the only method by which ultimate <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be meted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who perpetrate crimes which in my view are so horrible - I refer to some of the things which are happening in Northern Ireland and an incident which occurred in Brisbane not so very long ago - that there is only one way by which <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be meted out, and that is by means of capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are people in this chamber who would say, if he had gone ahead and killed 2 policemen as well as his de facto wife and been brought to trial, that <span class="highlight">justice</span> would have been done if he had been put in gaol for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We went to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and at it portrayed France as a criminal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happened while we had our Attorney-General before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> lambasting the people of France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This apparently was in the name of equity, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality of opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has tried to develop a fair system, a system about which it still has reservations but by which it believes it is getting closer to doing <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and which is far more comprehensive and which takes in a far wider cross section of .matters than the Karmel Committee took into account in its absurd, so-called current resources uses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a man may be found guilty only after having passed through all the procedures we have created to ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Poyser  denies the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of then imposing capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area in which I feel the concepts of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> ought to have some application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those 2 gentlemen, not so insofar as the finding of guilt was concerned because that was a finding by the Committee of Privileges after hearing evidence, but when the 2 gentlemen concerned were not called upon before punishment was imposed to show cause why they should be punished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, as I submitted in perhaps an unduly lengthy address, that was a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quoted many substantial authorities to support my proposition that the Senate should have given the 2 gentlemen concerned the opportunity of showing cause why they should or should not be punished, and that having been denied that opportunity there was a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope, as does  Senator Greenwood,  that you will be able to allow what I consider to be <span class="highlight">justice</span> to prevail and permit  Mr Everingham  to defend himself against the charges which he does not at present know of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One concerned his refusal to give the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Murphy,  permission to make a personal statement this afternoon after  Senator Greenwood,  a former AttorneyGeneral and a person whom I should have thought would have been endowed with the principles of fair play and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, had been given the opportunity, by leave, to make such a statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims that it is doing this only out of a feeling for electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a new thing for any government to be in favour of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the attitude of governments towards matters such as these is not: Is it electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government really wants electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the door is wide open. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Clyde  Cameron made the point with great firmness that the system which in his view would give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Australia and which would be quite satisfactory for the Labor movement was the proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the committee brought in a report which stated that electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> could best be obtained by introducing a system of proportional representation and that if such a system had existed the complaints of the Labor Party over a number of elections to the effect that it had received a majority of votes but a minority of seats would have been unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to labour the point except to say again that if electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is wanted it can be obtained by proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government has seen the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of making an allocation in this field and has decided to make an extra $28m available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, after a lot of representation the Government, seeing the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of his case, imposed a dumping duty of 2c per lb on imported New Zealand jam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where in Mildura, in South Australia, at Tom Piper’s in Melbourne and at Jusfruit in Gosford is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this kind of action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume by that he means that we are in the region in which the French are conducting tests -  which give Australia that option of approaching the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> against the French tests are not applicable against the Chinese tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that at one stage the Prime Minister appealed to the ACTU to remove the ban, not because he disagreed with it but because he thought lt might affect the Australian case before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the case before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not oppose the Government taking the French Government to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when we asked about China we were told that because China does not recognise the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> there is no legal basis for taking China before that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are plenty of other actions open to the Government to show and move its condemnation of Chinese atmospheric tests, instead of hiding in a cowardly manner behind some legal quibble that China does not recognise the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and that therefore we should sit down, wring our hands and say we can do nothing more about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is now the Commonwealth Police -  and the security functions in connection with subversive activities affecting the internal security of Australia are under the control of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a doctrine was justified in the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century, when social conditions in most of the civilised countries were stabilised, and denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> was an exception rather than the rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only sensible contribution that  Senator Little  made was to say that the period of 15 minutes which is given to each  speaker  does not allow him to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to such a far reaching subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thank goodness that we had people of the calibre of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore who was prepared to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It took  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore to tell an industrial company like the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd that, when a new award was agreed to and made, a few more dollars should be spent so that it could be printed in 3 or 4 different languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo was very emphatic: A multiplicity of funds and no discipline over the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite a good deal of abuse, the Liberal Government saw the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the plea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions of Australian citizens or organisations in protesting against the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific have to be understood in the light of the open disregard by France of the ruling of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the relative effects on the Australian environment of fall-out from French and Chinese tests (see the answer given in the Senate on IS May 1973 to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth’s priority for defence, security and social welfare, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and general well-being would have to be ensured together with the ability to manage the economy and maintain stability in the currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator referred to the ballyhoo that went on in Paris when  Senator Murphy  appeared before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just to get the record straight may I point out to my honourable opponent that the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> met at The Hague and certainly not in Paris. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the French government cannot accept the argument presented at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> by the governments of Australia and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scientific evidence given to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was sufficient to prove, in my view, even if it has not convinced  Senator Hannan,  that there is a possible danger from all nuclear explosions wherever they may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told when we asked why Australia did not take this matter to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at The Hague that it could not be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of our claim is that the French are committing a nuisance in our environment and we are hoping that the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> will take steps to restrain that nuisance; to enjoin the French from committing it- the same way as can happen between neighbours - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test is simply this: Is the Government handing out even handed treatment and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to France and to China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test of this motion is- this: Has the Whitlam Labor Government dealt out equal <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it only reasonable that if the Government was to take its case to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> the people of Australia were entitled to know what the issues were, and I asked for the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike previous governments, the proximity of elections will not be a deciding factor in the rate at which pensions are increased; rather it will be our commitment to achieve social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> for pensioners to establish pension payments at an adequate level and as a right, and to maintain these principles consistently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stamps the Labor Party as a party which budgets for votes and which, in its assessment of the inflationary impact of the Budget or the equitable impact of the Budget as between the various people of this country, denies any sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or competence whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout the world continuing comprehensive reports were required by all sections of the media on the brisk moves of the new Labor Government; for instance, the abolition of national service, revaluation of the dollar, recognition of the People’s Republic of China, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic and North Vietnam, Australia’s stand on the French nuclear testing in the Pacific, the subsequent finding by the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the effects of Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order that there be some degree of certainty that the approaches which are being taken by the Minister are correct he has proposed that a royal commission, to be chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, should inquire into the whole of the operations of the oil industry and its ancillaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such application was heard and determined by the Court, by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, no one knows better than you,  Mr President,  that history does not support the view that truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> always triumph. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall being checked on one occasion because I said something about <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only being done but being seen to be done and immediately the  chairman  pulled me up and asked: ‘You are not a lawyer, are you’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose is working on his report, but it will not be available until April or March next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the nature of one or two of the speeches, I wish to be heard to say briefly that, firstly,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, as the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Bishop)  has said, is conducting an inquiry into the principles of repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse is conducting an inquiry as to general compensation for injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not mean to distemper what I have to say, which is a plea that the inquiries of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodhouse and the idea incorporated in this Bill of an equality between war service and civilian service ought to be brought onto a basis on which the relevant sections of beneficiaries get equality on a comparable basis of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will read what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich had to say because of its pertinence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wage control without price control is contrary to common sense, a distortion of <span class="highlight">justice</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is interesting, a distortion of <span class="highlight">justice</span> - and an inevitable cause of conflict and a deep sense of grievance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, if  Senator Cavanagh  says that  Dr Cairns  was correct, then he is wrong now, because  Dr Cairns  not only said that it was contrary to common sense but also- and this should strike a chord in  Senator Cavanagh  ‘s heart- that it was a distortion of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and an inevitable cause of conflict and a deep sense of grievance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he noted the strong views of a Liberal Member of the Legislative Council in Victoria who said that we retain the ancient barbarism and mental torture in our punitive system and that there is no greater wrong perpetrated in our society than that which goes under the name of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising that the Attorney-General has an enlightened attitude on such social questions, will he give consideration to initiating discussions with State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to examine better methods of dealing with offenders than incarceration in existing penal institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the purpose of any system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> ought to be the prevention of crime and the protection of the public rather than revenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have continued with the setting up of a committee to inquire into defence forces pay; Only yesterday a  deputy president  of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Coldham, was appointed  chairman  of the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that in some respects the honourable senator’s question touches on the matter which was before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I lay on the table a report prepared by Professor Gordon Hawkins and  Dr Robert  L. Misner dated 20 July 1973 on the restructuring of the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were introduced into the House of Representatives in the first place because that is where the Postmaster-General  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  resides, and therefore many of the inequities and injustices and what might be called the unevenness of the charges were brought up and debated there; and because of that the Government agreed to make certain consequential changes, and after discussion these were accepted by the Opposition and this is therefore to be regarded as assent by the Opposition to let the matters go forward to the Senate at that level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One receives complaints and expressions of concern from many genuine people in the community and even today I am unable quite clearly to elucidate just what is the level of <span class="highlight">justice</span> achieved in the House of Representatives and what level of injustice remains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace was required, and this often created difficulties in more remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This simply means that under section 9 of the Post and Telegraph Act an officer, before exercising the duties of his office, will make and subscribe before a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace or, as an alternative, before a postmaster a declaration in the form A set forth in the second schedule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this is that in country areas it is sometimes difficult to get a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that at the same time as that change is being made there is this change in clause 3 of the Bill which means that an officer is a person who does not take an oath or make a declaration before a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace but before a postmaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they first join they have to take an oath and that oath is administered by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that this is an interference with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  humour, his sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, his very pertinent and pungent wit in interjections, I think, have put fear into members of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions have been made that rather than speaking to, say, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, I, as Attorney-General, should get the Prime Minister to write a letter to the Premier who would then go through these mechanics, which make it very awkward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally have always felt that this is <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is likely to be tempered by injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is provision for a range of people simply to be appointed by the Minister, which can be even more extensive than an official of the Department, it can lead to injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to quote from the proceedings of the Commission of Inquiry into Land Tenures, which is being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell, as  Chairman,  and Professor R. L. Mathews and  Mr G.  J. Dusseldorp, who is a fairly large scale developer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already quoted the evidence given before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell in respect of the landholder who bought land for $32 an acre and who now wants to sell it for $5,000 an acre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to me that if today one is in favour of blanketing land areas around Albury-Wodonga to ensure that nobody capitalises on the development planned for that area- and I did not hear too many voices raised in this Parliament over that proposal- one must hold the same philosophy in respect of this area provided one is convinced that it is being followed with reasonable <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter of organisation and of ensuring that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to all the people around the area who are making a contribution to the development of the area by deciding to settle in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any major changes must be related to other rehabilitation measures and accordingly must await the outcome of investigations that are now being undertaken by the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme Committee of Inquiry under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(South AustraliaMinister for Aboriginal Affairs)- by leave- As honourable sei  senators  : s aware, Her Majesty the Queen and His  Royal  Highness Prince Philip will receive the Presiding Officers of Parliament, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, the Ministers of State, the Opposition leaders and their wives at Government House at 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arbitration legislation was introduced for the purpose of giving some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what we should be unitedly striving to achieve at the present time is to ensure that our system works efficiently and does <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all who are subject to its influence from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court was composed of some judges who had acted in cases over the years when they were at the bar and who had had the problem brought to their attention, especially  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr who is now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and who had been in a number of cases involving just this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a classic case that was ultimately settled after negotiations had been conducted over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, if not longer, by Pat Ryan, the secretary of the union, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson, who is another excellent example of a judge with a high degree of industrial relations knowhow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside the trade union vigilance that we have been talking about there are many light industries in which I do not say that the employer is deliberately avoiding wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the employee because sometimes some of his clerical staff are not abreast of current awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at any time he cannot get <span class="highlight">justice</span> by negotiations with the employer and he thinks it better that he should lead the men and he does so and suggests to them that they have a stoppage of work to consider things, he is possibly acting contrary to the award covering the industry and engaging in an unlawful act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple facts are that the workers will not be denied <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be the very travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for us to increase the time available to the Executive and diminish the time available to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that we can bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to meet the difficulties under which they are working so that they will not find it necessary to take action as they took today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we speak of the courts the tendency is to speak, say, of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This term seems to be a more satisfactory term than ‘Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As long ago as 1957 no less an authority than the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Owen  Dixon, suggested that this Parliament should establish a national law reform body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Tenth Legal Convention of the Law Council of Australia held in Melbourne that year the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reviewing laws to which this Act applies, the Commission will have in view systematic development and reform of the law, including, in particular: the modernisation of the law; the elimination of defects in the law; the simplification of the law; and the adoption of new or more effectivemethods for the administration of the law andthe dispensation of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to oppose the Bill which appears, on the surface, to be a purely mechanical one which provides, I think in all fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, for the transfer of officers from State authorities to the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I visualise the thousands of agreements-  Senator Murphy  himself used this expression- which could well come within the purview of this legislation I wonder how <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be done to persons affected in the time which is allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1 962 the then AttorneyGeneral, now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, evidently was commissioned by the coalition Government to prepare a Trade Practices Bill and subsequently a Bill was introduced in 1 965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It imposes very heavy restrictions on the grounds on which these objections can be made and allows the introduction of certain injustices in the sense that changes in the rules could have a significant effect on members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only influence we can possibly hope to exercise in the area in order to achieve peace is to approach the matter as an evenhanded country which does not have any vested interests and which is trying to resolve the question in the light of morality and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact one could say that with quite complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> because Israel itself admits that the Golan Heights area in Syria which it now occupies, and the Sinai peninsula, are parts respectively of Syria and of Egypt and not parts of Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps what Israel has done, as  Senator Wheeldon  rightly said, was not done with complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> to everybody concerned, but it is an established fact today that Israel has created a miracle in an area of the world where people had to grub from the hostile environment only the barest necessities of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we do not seem to be deciding the question on the basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, fairness or working for the benefit of settling disputes; we are deciding it on prejudice and on the party numbers system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seemed to me to be a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the  Deputy  Registrar refused to give assistance in the first instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is to the credit of this Government that that injustice was ultimately remedied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main cause of the dislocation of industry and the withholding of labour is a belief that there is not comparable wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far from this being expounded from the point of view of land developers, I remember a case in Sydney in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich had occasion to comment where a man had a lease of a car park for 3 years and the Commonwealth of that day contended that he had no interest in land, he was making a profitable business from it and his lease was limited to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have often expressed our concern in Opposition- I suppose if one looked back through the record members of the present Government would have expressed their concern when in Opposition, but I think with less <span class="highlight">justice</span>- at the inability of honourable senators to obtain information from Ministers on matters of public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to weary honourable senators, but I should like to quote what was said by a former  President  of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and very prominent member of the Liberal Party,  Sir Percy  Spender, in an address to the Australian Conservation Foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is well known to everyone here, I think, that in a case in the High Court against a fisherman who operated off the coast of New South Wales- the La Macchia case, if I might refer to it as such- a former Federal Attorney-General and now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, concluded that the Commonwealth had sovereign jurisdiction from the low-water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having one representative for an area of that size is not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> either to the member or to the people who live in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sorry that this has happened, and I appeal to the State Minister and his Government to co-operate in providing <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the black people of this country which has been denied to them for 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>So, applying a tapered percentage to give a better level of increase relatively to the upper level and to the lower echelon, one would get a much greater degree of <span class="highlight">justice</span> than one gets now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that the police force and those responsible for the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that people who do that to an official of a registered union are apprehended and dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more for political reasons, I think, than for the purpose of getting <span class="highlight">justice</span> for someone who is deprived of some payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A similar course was taken in regard to the former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, the late  Sir Owen  Dixon, if my recollection of the answer I sent is correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a person is to be presumed innocent of a criminal offence until he is proved guilty is overshadowed by the inequities of our criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system, and especially by the inadequacy of legal aid in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part II of the Bill goes on to provide a number of protections that are of importance in the field of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the determination of a criminal charge, everyone is to be entitled to a number of guarantees, such as the right to have legal aid where the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> so require and where he does not have sufficient means to pay for it, and the right not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in August 1972, Professor Wootten, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wootten, provided a forceful answer to this concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We suggest that the Commonwealth should give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to students rather than to schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overwhelming majority of the Australian people support <span class="highlight">justice</span> for independent schools but there is a small minority who do not and that minority has threatened action in the High Court to seek a ban on <span class="highlight">justice</span> for independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reason that the overwhelming majority of Australians regard it as an act of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to assist Australian children, whatever school they may go to, I think that this amendment is more comprehensive and clearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I prefer what  Senator Rae  supports which is, in effect, that we regard all the children of this country as having equal rights and we give each of them <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the Labor Party have assured me that they believe in equal <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all our children and that the only difference is, perhaps, in the ways in which the <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall be dispensed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Labor Party is going back to 1957- in the days when it did not agree with <span class="highlight">justice</span> for independent schools- when it states in this clause, in effect, that it will divide the children of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I attended a lot of meetings and I heard him say that he was for <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all the children of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My feeling is that the overwhelming majority of the Labor Party approves the decision of a few years ago that the Labor Party will stand for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the government I lead will remove a stain from our National Honour and give <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality to the Aboriginal People. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I’ll say No to setting up the NACC which gives no honour, <span class="highlight">justice</span> or equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government review its decision to limit that compensation and to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these exporters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is provision for supplementary grants to colleges to meet the increased costs of academic salaries resulting from the acceptance by the Government of the recommendations of the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, and to meet the cost of increased salaries and wages to college staff following the national wage case decision of May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such a case the price paid for the product is reduced by an exchange decision and assistance obviously is required to retrieve <span class="highlight">justice</span> for exporters who had committed themselves to the overseas market before revaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One year’s leave was the subject matter of that minute but as a special case, not Cabinet, not Caucus, not Parliament but the Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  authorised 2 years leave; in other words, a payment of $62,900 to an outgoing judicial person who combined the duties of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of a judicial office and Chief Commissioner of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, positions which for this purpose I would not distinguish between. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to express my keen disappointment at noticing no reference in any Auditor-General’s report to an item obviously deserving the attention of the Parliament- the payment to Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any provision in this Bill, by a Government which says that it wants electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to give the DLP with 500,000 votes any representation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say categorically that the purpose of this Bill is not electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not interested in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time no attempt was made by the media or most of the Press commentators to deal with the question of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I will say about these people is that they knew perfectly well from their association with Parliament that the average attitude of political parties is not ‘Is this electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a recent address to the Proportional Representation Society in South Australia,  Mr Clyde  Cameron said that in his opinion the only system of election which could be calculated to give electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all parties was the Hare-Clark proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A committee of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party, led by the late  Senator Sam  Cohen,  Mr Gordon  Bryant and other leading personalities of the branch, was asked to sit down and determine the system which in its opinion would give electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and would ensure that if the Australian Labor Party ever received 50 per cent of the votes it would be in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee sat down and produced an excellent report which indicated that the fairest system of election and the system which gave the nearest thing to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> was the Hare-Clark proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without prejudicing the issue, will the Minister give the Senate a report from his Department on the circumstances of this case and what action, if any, the Minister can take to prevent any recurrence which, on the face of it, would seem to go against our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the present time we have one resident judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For instance I note that this year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy has sat in all jurisdictions together with the jurisdiction in Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske has sat in the Australian Capital Territory, in the Northern Territory and in the Industrial Court for a total of 78 days this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, notwithstanding that he has been on the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, this year has sat some 1 3 days in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki has sat some 57 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it means that another judge has to be appointed so that there are no delays in <span class="highlight">justice</span> being dispensed, as against having only one judge and <span class="highlight">justice</span> being held up, then I certainly come down in favour of appointing extra judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see any commonsense or <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a proposal that we shall be forced to vote for a commission with which we disagree when at the very time the Government has the power in its hands to do the whole thing itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to the Government to honour the promises and to see that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> for every Australian child and every Australian parent who wish to avail themselves of their right to choose the kind of education which the children are to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a perversion of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a system that is supposed to believe in equality of opportunity for all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments to be moved by the Opposition merely insist that the <span class="highlight">justice</span> referred to by that headmaster continue to be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> requires that that should be done, but we are not saying that we can take the role of being able to provide full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Austraiian believes in what was called aid, but what I call <span class="highlight">justice</span>, for independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The rates should be more in keeping with the market in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to dispossessed owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Retrospective legislation involves a bad principle in British <span class="highlight">justice</span> anywhere that it is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to forfeit the vessel and all the equipment thereon without a court considering the circumstances involved seems to us to be not in accordance with the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This objective is expressed to include modernisation of the law to bring it into accord with modern conditions, the elimination of defects in the law, the simplification of the law and the adoption of new or more effective methods for the administration of the law and the dispensation of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the adoption of new or more effective methods for the administration of the law and the dispensation of <span class="highlight">justice</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator knows, we expect that early in the new year we will receive a report from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, as  Senator Dame  Nancy Buttfield knows,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose examined systems overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also considered it to be premature in view of the general inquiry into national rehabilitation and compensation by the committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse, with his experience in New Zealand, has been brought to Australia to work with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares to formulate such a scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties can be understood if I mention that in New Zealand all that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was able to recommend was originally compensation up to $80 a week which has since been lifted, I believe, to $120 a week; but it has been confined to accident injuries as distinct from illness or disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a principle which, as I have said, balked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and the New Zealand legislature up to this time, and it is such an extension of this Bill, making the ambit of the compensation so wide ranging, that we feel we would be quite irresponsible in the interests of the industrial worker, the State public servant and the selfemployed person if we did not try to fix a level of compensation that shall apply to people entitled to this form of compensation not restricted exclusively to Commonwealth public servants but available to the other classes of employees on a basis that can be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the further consideration of the Bill be deferred until after the general inquiry into National Rehabilitation and Compensation by the Committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse has reported . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main point raised on the report brought forward concerning the supplementary submission of this reference was that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse of New Zealand was at present looking into an Australia-wide compensation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although honourable senators opposite have argued that the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse ought to be able to provide a new system of compensation for every person, which is what the inquiry has set out to do, I think honourable senators opposite will realise, without my bleating about it, that even if the committee of inquiry were to report by March or May of next year there would be a lot of complications involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not think that deferment of this Bill until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse ‘s inquiry has been completed really meets the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule 1 of the Bill, incorporates the determination made by the Medical Fees Tribunal under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke, for consultations and visits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our program is not one which stems from doctrinaire beliefs but it is one which flows from a sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am just pointing out to the Government that one of the things which the Australian Constitution said, in line with human rights and fundamental <span class="highlight">justice</span>, is that if the Government wants to acquire a citizen’s property it can do so only on just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there are some questions to be examined in relation to this case and if there may have been some miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there may have been some miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> with which my portfolio is concerned, I certainly will do what I can to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present the pleadings, oral arguments and orders relating to the first phase of the nuclear tests case in the proceedings brought by Australia in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position adopted by my Party is that under protest and only as an armistice- not because it is what we believe; we are going to make a continuing fight for educational <span class="highlight">justice</span>- we will accept what has been proposed and will not oppose any of the amendments, but if an amendment is moved which is based on the use of the word ‘primary’ we will support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the introduction of the Bill I think we have had tabled in the Parliament a report on the inquiry into land tenure which was chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he can tell me what opportunity the Parliament will have to approve any decision that is made as to proposals for land tenure contained in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell and which may be applied to this Albury-Wodonga centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know what opportunity the Parliament will have either to approve or to reject any decisions that are made to apply the propositions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell to Albury-Wodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wright  has stated,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell came down on the side of a report of a previous inquiry into this matter, and it would seem to be the one adopted by those who have been looking for a solution to this question of land prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that on this occasion  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell came down with the same conclusion, which would appear to confirm that this is the way to solve the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was brought by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, when he was Attorney-General, to the stage of a Bill being introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal for the Superior Court was originally put forward by the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia when he was Attorney-General and the justification for setting up the Court rested largely on the need to relieve the High Court of most of its single <span class="highlight">justice</span> original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the most important appointment will be that of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is contemplated that, if the Bill is passed by Parliament, an early appointment of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> will be made to enable the first Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to participate in the considerable task of organising the necessary administrative arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This report was prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, who was the  Chairman  of the Committee and who has been seconded to a judicial position in Fiji,  Sir Leslie  Melville and  Sir Norman  Mcintosh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all deference to the speeches made by  Senator Little  and  Senator Rae  this afternoon, nobody has admitted, despite what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo said, that there is a flaw in the existing structure of the funds, because after all this inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo commenced in 1968 and  Senator Greenwood  was Minister for Health for a brief period between 1969 and 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only because  Mr Hayden  leaned on the so-called and much vaunted private enterprise scheme is she getting some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I throw out this challenge to the Senate tonight: My office in Sydney has been open to representatives of the Australian Medical Association and to people who have been filched and denied <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the HCF and MBF. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators that in regard to at least 10 cases when I wrote to Bill Hayden the people concerned received <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people concerned received <span class="highlight">justice</span> because  Mr Turner  and  Mr Cade  of the hospital benefit funds knew that I would expose the funds in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am grievously disappointed,’ I waited for  Senator Rae  and for  Senator Little-  I know that he will reply in the debate- to answer the points made in this document prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was good enough for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo to prepare the constructive proposals that he produced in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was presided over by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, who conducted an inquiry at great length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After having conducted that inquiry at great length, after, having- I say this for the benefit of  Senator Jessop-  visited Canada and inspected the Canadian scheme and after taking evidence  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo made the following findings: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was an inquiry that was presided over by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such an inquiry, as honourable senators will be aware, is at present being undertaken by the Taxation Review Committee under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have therefore confined our investigations in this report to identifying what we believe are major defects in the Australian death duties system and to recommending guidelines for reform which if implemented will, in our opinion, make for improved efficiency and greater tax <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recommending these far reaching proposals for death tax reform which we contend will lead to improved efficiency and greater tax <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all Australians, the Committee is mindful of the fact that if these recommendations are accepted, their implementation will involve considerable practical difficulties that can only be resolved by the closest co-operation between the Australian and State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, as amended, does not ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all children but it does guarantee that every Australian school child in 1974 and 1975 will share in the per capita finance made available by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not, we will certainly continue to press the Government to adopt our policy of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard this as merely a stepping stone to another campaign to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for schools and to establish the principle that we are not aiding schools which are the property of religious denominations; we are aiding Australian children who are attending these schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it mean that it is to be taken literally by those schools, that they can expect not to receive anything after this 2-year period has elapsed unless they go broke in the meantime or, by some other reduction of standards, manage to qualify for the Government’s idea of educational <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In endeavouring to provide proper arrangements for legal aid, it is worth noting the warning of the Lord Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of England, Lord Widgery who spoke in Perth this year of the twin ogres of cost and delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969, in a case involving boundaries in the North Sea, the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> emphasised what is known as the morphological concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the growers could get <span class="highlight">justice</span> on revaluation, and if some form of adjustment to the present level of costs, having regard to the price reduction caused by exchange changes, could be brought about by an adjustment of the stabilisation scheme, it would be of terrific help to this industry in this critical year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the Ministers for Labour considered the adequacy of existing concepts of long service leave and whether there could be portability of service between employers and industries, in the interest of job mobility on the one hand and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the individual employer on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr was conducting his proceedings I took the opportunity to make clear my objection to a judge who occupied judicial office entertaining inquiries individually by some people in the absence of others and receiving statements not based upon any formal authentication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the knowledge of those facts the Attorney-General certainly had a duty to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done and that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was not perverted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If only this morning he discovered that in fact the pistol was loaded and the circumstances of the loading of the pistol; if only this morning he discovered- he said this in the chamber this afternoon- that a young girl, a receptionist I think, was threatened- and one presumes threatened by a loaded pistol- to use the Minister’s words, I say that the Minister should have informed himself on the Thursday and should have seen that the proceedings from then onwards were carried out with full <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party has said very clearly in its federal policy- and this has been said very clearly also by members of the Government and by the Government itself- that there can be no settlement of the present crisis in the Middle East without, first, some <span class="highlight">justice</span> being done to the Palestinian refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing which we have to do, and which we have done, is to insist on all occasions that we are not prepared to see the destruction of Israel, and at the same time we are prepared to do what we can to work for <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done to the Palestinian Arabs, the former population, or descendants of the former population, of those areas which now constitute the State of Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the initiative of the Australian Government a very progressive jurist was brought from New Zealand in the person of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse to write a new chapter of compensation and disaster coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add, in case any director of the Phoenix Insurance Co. is listening, that I did not worry about answering the company’s scurrilous letter to the Treasurer but I did present a pretty substantial submission to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse which answered very effectively, that company as well as its counterparts who have tried to ignore their responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless this Government representing the national interest can induce the unions and the employers to get together to determine a system which will give the ordinary worker <span class="highlight">justice</span> from a wage point of view, and ensure that the general interests of the community are preserved, within 8 months we will be in the same position as is Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday that the circumstances surrounding the McLeod incident last Thursday might involve a conspiracy to pervert the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or result in a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and in view of the concern generated in the public’s mind by information thus far elicited in this and in another place, will the Attorney-General make every effort to have the findings of the inquiry which has been instituted made available to the Senate early next week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It came to the conclusion that the electoral system which gave <span class="highlight">justice</span> and which was best for all parties and for the Australian Labor Party was proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For all that one reads of the various reports from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else Mitchell and  Mr Louis  Voumard in Victoria in which the need for Commonwealth Government assistance is recognised, and for all that one knows of the condition of local government and the need it has for more money to achieve objectives in the area of local government- for all of those things, is it worth while to accept money on conditions from the Commonwealth which will tie the body which spends the money simply to do what the central government of this country requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, I think that I truly express the conclusion of those Attorneys-General-  Mr Snedden, Mr N.  H.

    <p>Now in such a state of affairs, it would appear natural to endeavour to establish the courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as independent organs which were neither Commonwealth nor State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To reject the advice of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon in the passages I have read and to opt for a division of the court’s jurisdiction so far as it affects the Federal legislature and its legislation would be most retrograde indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon when at the Bar made a most notable contribution by way of submitting evidence to the royal commission presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nicholas which inquired into the Constitution in 1929. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some who would say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon’s scholarship was theoretical, technical and legalistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Broadly, they arise from the fact that jurisdiction has been conferred upon a court on certain very limited matters by reference to considerations or criteria which have no relation to the practical administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but to circumstances which arise or features which are exhibited only accidentally or incidentally to the ordinary administration or <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and this has been done from motives which ignore the efficient, speedy and orderly administration of the law, and concentrate upon the political expediency of a particular tribunal retaining control over particular questions which may be expected to arise, or dealing with particular persons who it was thought (why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Senate will take these matters into consideration and reject the Bill as an attempt to retrogress in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> beyond the veil of tears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What must happen as a result of such a duplicated system is the creation of so many complexities and difficulties for litigants that natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole basis of law, as has been said, is that it should be simple: It should give <span class="highlight">justice</span> as well as appearing to give <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Senator Wright  has quoted  Sir Owen  Dixon, a former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia in his opposition to a duplicate federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there any suggestion at all that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not done in this way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must add to endless litigation and endless costs and it must therefore deny natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the course of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will destroy that essential simplicity and understanding which is surely at the heart of an acceptable system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The task of all courts is to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all who appear before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previous speakers have set out what ought to be the criteria for a sensible legal system under which <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want a system which is not too costly and a system in which people can have their rights litigated, declared and affirmed, and <span class="highlight">justice</span> done at a cost which is within their means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we need a system which is not so time consuming that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is delayed and, therefore, <span class="highlight">justice</span> is denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, and whereas our existing Australian flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the Government-General and State Governors, and the independent courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and whereas all such rights, liberties, heritage, advancement and prosperity, etc., are of no avail if our armed forces are unprepared or incapable of repelling invasion of our shores or withstanding other military threats, so therefore must all these things be accorded the highest national concern and priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he wants to have some learning on these matters, probably one of the most famous legal decisions in history was given by the great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the United States of America, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Marshall, on the matters of when appointments, commissions and so forth take effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator well knows, the reason we took France to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and did not take China to the Court was that China never accepted the jurisdiction of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It just shows that if the Commissioners do have a capacity to vary the quota by up to 20 per cent they can bring about a fair amount of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that, because 1 appreciate the very great task that electoral commissioners have in attempting to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> as between electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole emphasis of his Bill was on the 1 3 per cent of people who were regarded as being under the poverty line and on what he considered were injustices to members of the AMA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply say that the Government is making an endeavour, in the light of the criticisms made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo in his report, to reform the health system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>According to  Mr Whitlam  today, the autumn sittings are getting pretty short, and I think that it does no <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Senate to have the Minister bring forward 2 Bills and say: ‘Debate those. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague,  Senator Mulvihill,  said, it was presided over by  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After conducting an inquiry lasting some 18 months,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo brought down a series of findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators opposite that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, prior to the presentation of his report, also visited Canada and looked at the situation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then it is necessary to advert to the fact that the person who has been designated to succeed  Sir Paul  Hasluck is  Sir John  Kerr, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to such a degree has the draftsman of this Bill confused the GovernorGeneralship with the judiciary that there is a link between the pension to be payable to the Governor-General and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that it is proposed to link the pension not with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s pension but with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides in clause 4 that an allowance is payable to the GovernorGeneral during his life at the rate stated, which is 60 per cent of the rate of the salary payable to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are confronted with a Bill which provides that a Governor-General who retires at the age of 45 years shall receive, whatever be the period of his service, a pension equal to 60 per cent of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s salary for the rest of his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be wholly inappropriate that wealthy persons who may be appointed should go out on a pension of 60 per cent of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s salary after 3 or 5 years of executive service, or that political favourites appointed to an executive office should go out with this handsome pension which a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> earns by very different considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  was reading his speech rapidly last night, as soon as the Bill was introduced, when I said that I wanted to examine, the Bill to ensure that no more than 60 per cent of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> ‘s salary was being provided for by way of pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that we will be doing the Constitution a great disservice if we introduce on different grounds and different conditions for a GovernorGeneral a pension which is expressed to be the equivalent of 60 per cent of the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for the time being, unless we make it comparable in the conditions of entitlement to those to which the judges conform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, with this Government, electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> goes out the door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the allowance of the Governor-General is to be reduced by the amount of periodic pension payments he receives, it follows as the night the day that it is logical and fair that if that periodic pension is converted into a lump sum, then that lump sum should be subtracted from the 60 per cent of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> salary that is payable to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see that the slightest question of policy arises in this matter, and I would expect that every Labor man would support such a proposition, that is to say, that under the Act a retiring Governor-General is to be provided with a pension equal to 60 per cent of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s salary, and if he is receiving a periodic pension either from the State or the Commonwealth or the Territory, whether it be a judicial pension, a parliamentary pension or, as I interpret it, a superannuation pension- as to that I ask the Minister to confirm my understandingthe amount of the periodic pension is deducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, our opponents have sharpened our sense either of j <span class="highlight">justice</span> or injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. O.

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  C. L. D. Meares, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and the  Chairman  of the New South Wales Law reform Commission, was the other member of the inquiry and I should like to place on record the Australian Government’s appreciation of the action of the New South Wales Government in making him available for this task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The founders of the Constitution obviously recognised the simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the notion that, since the Parliament would make laws for the Territories, the citizens of the Territories should have a voice in that Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of a judicial decision given in April of this year by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, the sagacity and correctness of which I do not doubt, that under current legislation a person apprehended on the retractable steps of a civil aircraft while carrying a gun is not guilty of an offence, will the Attorney-General give consideration to having the law amended so that such persons can be charged with an offence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask: What is the position in regard to the inquiry into repatriation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In substance I think that what  Senator Wright  has said as to the recommendations of the report of the committee presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse is correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the recommendations in the Woodhouse Committee report and the recommendations from the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose into repatriation will overlap in many important respects and ultimately it will be essential for the Government and the Parliament to compare the 2 reports before there can be a satisfactory determination of the future of repatriation benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose is almost completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wright  knows, a very thorough and a very searching inquiry into the whole of the existing repatriation structure has been undertaken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose will be tabled in Parliament immediately it is complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing I would say is that while both the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares have been commissioned by the Government they are not necessarily the policy of the Government, although legislation is obviously envisaged in the field of a national compensation scheme and obviously consideration has been given to making more satisfactory in some respects the present repatriation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report on Aboriginal land rights said that his recommendations were being put forward as a basis for negotiation between Aboriginal councils and the Government, that Aboriginal people themselves must be fully consulted about any steps proposed to be taken and that an imposed white solution is unacceptable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to establish a commission, and legislation will be brought down in the Budget session for its establishment, along the lines recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the type of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> the Labor Party wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Labor Party is so wedded to its claims of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, fairness and equality, regardless of the consequences, why has it not attempted to equalise the electorates in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory with the rest of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not been introduced for reasons of equity, of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or to obtain one vote one value because those provisions are established under our present legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know it has been said that there is nothing sacred about the principle of majority rule, that it is a principle of order rather than exact <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee also included  Mr Hamilton,  the then member for Canning and a distinguished member of the Parliament and a Country Party man also;  Mr Downer,  a former Minister and a former Australian High Commissioner;  Mr Joske,  who later became  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske;  Mr Whitiam,  now Prime Minister of Australia;  Mr Ward; Mr Pollard; Mr Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the High Court of Ireland, the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Budd in the case of O ‘Donovan v. the Attorney-General in February 1961 stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again in the United States Supreme Court in June 1964 in the case of Reynolds v. Sims, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in delivering the opinion of the Court said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Rehnquist, writing for the Court, argued that prior cases condemning smaller deviations were distinguishable because they applied standards for congressional districting drawn from article I, section 2 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relying on dictum in Reynolds v. Sims, the initial state legislative districting case, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Rehnquist found that more flexibility [is] constitutionally permissible with respect to state legislative reapportionment’ m order to enable states to pursue rational policy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with that if it is going to give <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if it is to keep as near as possible to one vote one value, to result in electorates of equal number? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By denying them the right to vote the Opposition is also doing them a grave injustice because the population of the Northern Territory is made up of a great many people who, in years gone by, have enjoyed the right in the States to vote at Senate elections and referendums and who, because they have decided to go the the Northern Territory and help in its development, have lost those voting rights and have been disenfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been endeavouring ever since 1 968 to give to the people in the Territories the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which they are entitled, that is, the right to stand up and speak for themselves on matters affecting the Territories and to have a say in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward in this report effectively sums up the history of the rapid and often brutal process by which the Aboriginal people were dispossessed in 5 brief paragraphs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn in the Northern Territory Supreme Court in 1971 was that it made it perfectly clear that if Aboriginals were to obtain land rights it would have to be by an Act of Government and not through the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign for land rights conducted by Aboriginal organisations and their supporters in the 1960s did not lack enthusiasm and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the cause should have been apparent to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward, referring to submissions urging that he consider the possibility of cash compensation, argues: That the only appropriate direct recompense for those who have lost their traditional lands is other land- together with finance to enable that land to be used appropriately, either for housing or for some economic purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission’s analysis of the problems and its recommendations will, I have no doubt, have far reaching implications for the whole relationship between Aboriginal Australians and their fellow citizens,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has dealt with a most complex and difficult problem in an admirably clear and comprehensive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The able logician opposite evidently considers that this is a matter which should be perpetuated in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is necessary also to ensure that the increasing number of white collar criminals cannot escape <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia by flight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this is not <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that it is cruel and, worst of all, chaotic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does not consent, the Authority can get a warrant from a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under clauses 43 to 50, an act of gazettal and ratification by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace enables the Authority to explore for and recover petroleum from a declared area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General at that time,  Mr President,  was an eminent former learned Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to the Governor-General to obtain advice on the constitutional question from other quarters- perhaps from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Attorney-General or eminent counseland then a solemn responsibility rests on him to make a judgment on whether a dissolution is needed to serve the purposes of good Government by giving to the electorate the duty of resolving a situation which Parliament cannot resolve for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Owen had taken a contrary view in the Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this principle is correct, why does the Government go through the pretence, if pretence it is, of allowing a Governor-General to seek or to obtain advice from a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, from a Solicitor-General or from any experienced person in the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the job of the Attorney-General to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done at all levels, not to stack up litigation for some contest at some future time in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an extraordinary situation for him to conceive that he should resist the normal processes of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recommendation made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell in his report entitled Inquiry into Academic Salaries’ and dated May 1973 in which he proposed the establishment of an academic salaries tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a very serious case and yet that was held to be not a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been informed from that source that a majority of the Labor Caucus has approved of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell’s Remuneration Tribunal which deals, firstly, with the salaries of Ministers of the Crown, including the Prime Minister; secondly, with the salaries of members of Parliament - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill warrants support because it extends the ability of this country to bring before its courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> those who it is believed have left Australia in order to avoid the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that we in Australia- and I apply the principle in terms of the Australian situation- can have the greatest facility which our arrangements with other countries can make whereby anybody who is required to face courts in terms of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is to be administered and who has left Australia ought to be able to be extradited back to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his own analytical approach to questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that members of the Government disclosed when they received the report from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, but they certainly had it long before the Opposition did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wright tells us, as if there were no other evidence presented, that it is ridiculous to pay the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia $45,000 per annum, which possibly is not as high as the salary paid to the pilot of a Boeing 747 jet aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, after making an examination here some years ago, visited the United States of America and England and then wrote to the Prime Minister of the day,  Mr McMahon,  pointing out that there was a tendency throughout the world for this interlocking situation to arise with people dealing with various types of salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People believed that that sort of argument, apart from the arbitral determination brought down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell and his two associates, should be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot relate parliamentarians to anybody in the community in a comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rang  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads through the report one sees that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, who after all has a little experience in these matters, has anticipated every utterance and every argument that people are trying to raise at this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if one wants to deal with this matter on an arbitral level, all those arguments have been anticipated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all  Senator Withers  said was that the economic circumstances have changed since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell wrote his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the real things of politics are concerned, where it is the wealth of the community and the equitable distribution of wealth, where it means some taxes to bring some social <span class="highlight">justice</span> into the community, where it is a significant increase in social service, they are all against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hughes of the United States Supreme Court made this very point in an opinion he delivered in 1933 in the case of Appalachian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were all considered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen when he was Attorney-General and his considered conclusion was that notwithstanding those difficulties the Superior Court Bill should be proceeded with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contained the proposal to increase pensions which obviously was necessary as a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the circumstances of a rate of inflation which this Government has not only allowed to continue but has fired through its term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that that is a very good tactic of the trained lawyer, but I thought that  Senator Durack  would have done more <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his case if he had kept to what is in the Bill and tried to debate it fairly and squarely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can give no undertakings at present other than to say that I am considering this matter, and shall be making submissions in due course to Cabinet with regard to extending these benefits which I think should be extended as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he know that on appeal to the New South Wales Supreme Court by the mining company,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope broadly upheld the Wyong Council’s view? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s view, after close examination and full discussions with the  Chairman  of the Tribunal, the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, that the provisions in this Bill will greatly increase the effectiveness of the Tribunal in combating inflation, and will do so in a manner that will continue to attract the co-operation of the business world at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright-  this great custodian of morals, principles, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play, the upholder of the dignity of the Senate, the great statesman of Australia, the great man from the Island State who comes over here in defence of all that is fair and free- makes accusations, many of which are false, and will not permit a reply to be given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that at least one member of the Liberal Party had the decency and the honesty to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done to both sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The denial of justicethat is what  Senator Wright  attempted to achieve tonight- is not typical of the profession which he follows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot hide behind  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick  made great play of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance, the Nimmo report, and demonstrated to us very clearly- I think we were all convinced- that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo had said nothing about nationalising the existing funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was quite remarkable; but it would have been more surprising if  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo had done the contrary, because his terms of reference were confined strictly to the existing voluntary health insurance schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the antithesis of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to allow a Minister to pick the judge whenever an appeal is launched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party members were  Sir Neil  O’sullivan;  Sir Alexander  Downer, son of one of the founding fathers of Australia’s Constitution, a Minister, later High Commissioner to Britain;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske; and  Senator Wright-  now one of the opponents of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe, in the words of the great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in 1964- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue surely is based on 2 facts or 2 studies, the first concerning the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the legislation, standing in its own right, and the second concerning the claim of the Government to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister stood up here and lectured us, as he so often does, about democracy and about what that great Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Earl Warren said in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, he certainly did not advert to the Supreme Court case of February 1973 involving the State of Virginia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States of America has been quoted today by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his findings in one case in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have consistently said over the 10 years that I have been involved in organisational politics that I believe in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and I believe in electoral equality, as do the majority of Australians, but they need to be implemented with a degree of tolerance and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My memory of that decision is that it certainly upheld that there should be electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and it agreed to the necessity for tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the position now and it is what honourable members and honourable senators opposite call <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that sort of presentation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Senate being allowed to pass judgment on important issues which affect the every-day lives of the people of the Northern Territory when they cannot get a representative in the Senate’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the electoral system is shown in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The men who wrote the Constitution were men of reason, men of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as a matter of arithmetic, what <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be found in these figures: 240,000 Tasmanian voters elect 15 representatives to the national Parliament; 95,000 Canberra voters elect 2 representatives to the national Parliament; and 30,000 Northern Territorians elect one representative to the national Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on equity; it is based on a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>; it will ensure that every person in this community is covered for health insurance purposes; and, most certainly, it is based on a freedom of choice- a freedom to choose the private medical practitioner that one cares to use and a freedom to choose the type of hospital treatment that one cares to draw upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills produce for the first time a system of health insurance incorporating the principles of social equity, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and universal coverage which are not present and not possible under the present health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation will improve health care in this country and will bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1962  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor brought down a judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In my most academic language, I shall rephrase the whole statement and read from the document compiled by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor said, when he found out that he was trying to dodge taxation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was signed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace from anywhere- he might even be from Canberracan issue a warrant allowing the Authority to enter land to explore for or carry on operations for the recovery of minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, without knowing whether the land is occupied, authorises the Authority to prospect or mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mere act of gazettal and ratification by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace is sufficient to allow this Authority to move into and operate in any declared area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This issue has been the subject of separate detailed consideration by the Government which will place proposals before the conference called by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore,  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, on wage fixation methods and indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this policy which informs both Bills and other measures such as the Australian Government submission put to the conference called by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore,  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, on wage fixation methods and wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It throws up starkly the lack of concern of previous Liberal-Country Party administrations for the pursuit of <span class="highlight">justice</span> regardless of the limited or non-existent means of the individual concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us go back a little and see what the policies of the Liberal and Country Parties are on individual rights, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and law reform, consumer affairs and other related matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After lengthy discussions the Antitrust Division in the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> approved the merger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister give urgent consideration to the  restoration of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the officers concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This transfer was held in abeyance awaiting the decision of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary for me to say only that such an ardent advocate for the civil rights of the consumer community and of the trade union community as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Frankfurter, in writing his introduction to a book on this subject, very thoughtfully written in 1928 by Berman, said that the book:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When he talks about this being just like what has gone on for 1 8 months he is not doing himself or the Senate <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those rules, I think, are set out fairly clearly in the judgment of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Jordan in the case of McFarlane v. Daniell, which is reported in 1938 New South Wales State reports, at page 345. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Jordan said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AlthoughI would very much like to move on from this clause, perhaps I should refer to some statements made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs in the famous case heard in 1911 of the King and the AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth v. Associated Northern Collieries, commonly known as the coal vend case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Isaacs deals with the legislation and says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been pointed out that the Commonwealth, under its own legislation- limited, as it is, to the corporations power- is not able to provide the small claims courts and the consumer tribunals which are required and cheap, quick and easy <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is necessary for individuals whether they are dealing with other individuals or with corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen,’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the independent Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately this comes up against a Sale of Goods Act a constitutional question arises and for as long as the long pocket of Coles will last in the taking of appeals to the High Court it will be able to litigate such a fellow out of any access to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it sufficient to say that the proper approach to be pursued in relation to clause 109 was indicated by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon in the case of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission v O’Reilly, which is reported in 107 Commonwealth Law Reports at pages 56 and 57. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Privy Council in some famous case dealt with this matter, saying that the tribunals were not courts of law at all but decided cases on what they thought was, in effect, equity, good conscience, fairness, <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a decision- the reference is in the Argus Law Reports of 1966, page 270- in which the full court of the High Court of Australia consisting of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Garfield  Barwick,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kitto,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer delivered a unanimous judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to how one approaches such matters, I refer again to the famous words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon in Briginshaw v. Briginshaw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last week or the week before at the meeting convened by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore around the question of industrial relations, attended by the most important people in the community,  Mr Cameron  proposed a system of indexation of wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop)  stated in his second reading speech, the present proposals arise from the decisions of the national conference under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s chairmanship which took place in 1967 and the matters concerned relate to permanent employment for the waterside work force on a weekly hiring basis, a pension scheme, the redundancy, disciplinary procedures and industrial dispute settlements, but they are of a temporary character and were expressly of a temporary character when they were first introduced in 1 967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the Friday a decision was to be made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wickham in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on issues which had been delayed because of problems as to whether a particular person had been served with a summons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A scheme is being evolved in the Northern Territory for the training of police cadets of whom it is expected that Aborigines will be a prominent section, and also of police liaison assistants to act as interpreters and in other roles in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am speaking now only in relation to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended in relation to mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The writ, which was brought before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox yesterday afternoon, seeks orders to prevent persons from conducting mining activities without first consulting the plaintiff,  Mr Coe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said that he was considering the action as an urgent ex parte application and he was prepared to keep an open mind on what he called an unusual application of a novel concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  reply was that he was of the opinion that it would depend upon how much  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox could be influenced by the decision that was made here today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of extreme public interest that no conduct should be permitted which is likely to prevent a litigant in a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> from having his case tried free from all matter of prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, important though it undoubtedly is, is not the only matter in which the public is vitally interested; and if in the course of the ventilation of a question of public concern matter is published which might prejudice a party in the conduct of a law suit, it does not follow that a contempt has been committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Lord <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was there saying, in my judgment, is that, if you had such a discussion in a paper of the rights of some pending litigation as is calculated to prejudice the proper trial of the action, that is a serious contempt which will be met with the necessary punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This matter will be heard by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is not inconsistent with fundamental rights and duties, the House should avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum or body of inquiry or permitting its proceedings to interfere in the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from particular matters, such as criminal cases, courts martial, civil cases and matters referred by a legislature to a judicial body, the rule has application to other hearings, inquiries and investigations in which the rights of individuals, or a community group, or the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be prejudiced, and it is the obligation of the Chair to hold the balance between the rights and duties of the House on the one hand and the rights and interests of the citizens on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was in 1918 that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins, the first  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, made the comment in the waterside workers’ case that ‘competition for membership between unions is disastrous to industrial peace’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its policy on wage indexation, currently under discussion under the auspices of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, the Government has put forward a package proposal which is designed to curb ‘double-counting’ with regard to prices in determination of wage claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier to the fact that I believe that Australians believe in social fairness and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that they are basically a tolerant nation, but over the last 20 months, and particularly latterly, we have seen an alarming divisiveness grow in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government talks much about its ideals of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There appears to be some difference between socialism and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How are the fine words about social <span class="highlight">justice</span> justified by the imposition of the capital gains tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Labor Party entered the 1972 and 1974 Federal elections and talked about social <span class="highlight">justice</span> it did not reveal the hidden realities that the Australian people would have to contribute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where does this ‘super tax’, this ‘unearned incomes’ tax, fit into the Government’s notion of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, is Australia still pursuing its proceedings in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> concerning atmospheric nuclear tests by France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has protested against this action by the French Government which is in breach of the order of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of 22 June 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The national compensation scheme, as put forward by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. D. Woodhouse, D.S.C., and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  C. L. D.

    <p>For all its difficulties and shortcomings, the Australian Constitution is not an insurmountable barrier against social reform and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides no stability, no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, no hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the great disabilities suffered by the blind, will the Minister urgently take action to see that this allowance is restored without delay and thus give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these pensioners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to raise a couple of points in relation to <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Queensland gaols and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> system in Queensland generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are a number of things that I want to read into the Hansard record because they are of paramount importance so far as the State of Queensland is concerned and so far as <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He lodged his complaints with the doctor and the visiting <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Premier- and I am referring to my good, close, personal friend, Holy Joh- and his Cabinet evade the issue they should be prepared to hand over the whole prison system in Queensland to the Australian Government, and those who have been accused by society will then at least be sure of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I accuse the Premier and his Cabinet of meting out less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who are deprived of their personal freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the principles in this matter cannot be discussed and debated in the Senate and that we cannot make up our minds is not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those people in the community who look to the Parliament to make laws and to debate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee was constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney of the Australian Industrial Court who was assisted by  Mr R.  E. McGarvie Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister representing the Prime Minister report on a probable date of receipt of the Remuneration Tribunal report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell in relation to academic salaries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that yesterday, 2 1 October,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell wrote to the Prime Minister advising him that he has decided to make an early review of academic salaries under the Act with a view to giving an early interim determination and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell expects to complete the review before the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the Queensland Parliament posed questions to the Minister after my statement here last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated, there is no question in anyone’s assessment of the structure which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney has recommended but that complementary legislation by the States is required and co-operation by the unions is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hear  Senator Button  say: ‘That is ludicrous’, but I do not think that that comment does him <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stop here again to say that that I think was the view which New South Wales at least put before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, and he adverts to it in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concern we have, and it is developing, is that  Mr Clyde  Cameron has unilaterally instituted this course and by unilateral action without consultation has jeopardised what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney put forward as a projected solution which, if it is to work, depends on co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that this legislation in fact was drafted in essence by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney who at this stage would be probably the most competent authority to deal with the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not recall what happened in 1973, but it was not until early 1974 that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney- a one-man inquiry, assisted by counsel- was appointed with a view to resolving some of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Bill seeks to give effect to is the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one must recognise the effort and the real attempt to make a resolution of this question which is contained in the document embodying  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, of course, very substantially gives effect to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I draw attention to 3 matters which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney regarded as crucial to the implementation of his resolution of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a bold step and one in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney may well be right in saying that he believes the Commonwealth has that power, but it is clearly an area in which doubt does exist and will exist until at some time in the future the High Court is called upon to make some adjudication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 15 on page 12 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s report he states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kernel of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney recommends is based upon the validity of a law of the character which is contained in this Bill under the Commonwealth Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that the whole scheme of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney is contemplating depends upon complementary State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At pages 28-32 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney’s report he sets out the various areas in which there must be complementary State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney continues: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney went on:  -the power which now appears in the Act and in a number of State Acts giving power to the tribunal to make an order entitling persons to membership and requiring the organisation to admit them is another question . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the steps which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney recommends, but these steps will be of no consequence unless the complementary amendments required to be made to State legislation by State parliaments are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the PostmasterGeneral  (Senator Bishop),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Labor and Immigration, to indicate whether he can say positively that the States will implement complementary State legislation as required by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether or not the trade unions would accept the conditions for non-incorporated registration of State branches as laid down by the honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator James  McClelland shares my view that there has been no legislation comparable to that in connection with which 1,000 copies of the tremendous report prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney- assisted by  Mr McGarvie,  Q.C.- were sent out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads the Minister’s second reading speech and the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, one sees that State Ministers of Labor and others involved in the State industrial field should have been aware of what was happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the overall considerations that were arrived at  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney made an evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases even with such an illustrious jurist as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore or  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson people have to make concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was good enough for one of the people involved in this dispute,  Mr McBeatty,  to say to me on 6-hour day that he hoped that when I came back to Canberra I would support action to implement speedily the product of the mind of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report on which this Bill is based is, as  Senator Greenwood  stated, the product of the labours of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that I detected some suggestions from  Senator Greenwood  that perhaps  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney was not the most competent man to comment on these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, if we were to search throughout the country it would be very difficult to find anybody more competent to come up with a solution to this problem than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, who was then a leading counsel at the Sydney Bar, acted in the matter and succeeded in persuading the court that the victory should go to our side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one of the judges in the Moore v. Doyle case- the judge, who I happen to know, was instrumental in drawing to the attention of both the State and Federal legislatures the necessity for getting together to find some solution to this problem; I refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, the present distinguished Governor-General of Australia- was in a position to know more about this problem than even  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, as a barrister, had been briefed in many cases- some of them cases in which I was the instructing solicitor- in which this problem of the dichotomy between State and Federal law in the matter of the status of registered organisations was at the heart of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the conjuncture in that case of the counsel,  Mr Sweeney,  Q.C., as he then was,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr on the Bench and, if I may say humbly, my presence in the case, which produced the passage in the judgment drawing the attention of the legislatures of this country to the need to do something about this festering sore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeny has said constantly that this is a problem that cannot be solved by the Australian Government alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, as honourable senators know, when we became the Government the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  requested  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and a committee to report on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney has discussed it in the report, and the decision is that it could be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, what we have done is simply to follow the suggestions and drafting recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has put into the Bill the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and his Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these problems are referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that proposed section is that it is constructive and it has been recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are simply reporting that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney indicated this as one of the things which might be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only at the last minute that we find that this is a matter not of ventilating <span class="highlight">justice</span> but of using a matter which we are notified is now before the court for the sole purpose of further repeating slander against an honourable senator in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essentially admitted on all sides that there are provisions in that Act which must be changed to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this area of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a seminar approximately  2Vi  years ago a most experienced judge in this field,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby of the New South Wales bench, in answer to a question from me, said: ‘Yes, there must be a cooling-off period’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We propose to have among the things considered in the awarding of maintenance, any fact or circumstance which the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the mere test of need she would possibly be entitled to have it but we want it left open so that a court in such circumstances can say: ‘No, the special facts here require that in <span class="highlight">justice</span> you be denied maintenance from your husband’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been a quite distressing example of that sort of thing in recent months when a few celebrities have had themselves paraded through the newspapers in matters which obviously were of no concern to anybody but themselves and to the authority- that is, the court- which has to arbitrate in these matters and see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am anxious that we should get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the women who have been a disadvantaged group in our society up to now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill which promises so much will be a farce if social <span class="highlight">justice</span> does not follow it and if in fact the same kind of bitterness that we see at the present time carries on after this Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These farcical hearings have brought the courts and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> into disrepute and have been humiliating to judges and to legal practitioners alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because it is based on the adversary system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter in which I am interested as a matter of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a matter which I think the Government would do well to look at clearly and carefully early in the piece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the AttorneyGeneral noted the remarks made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Head in Sydney last week in sentencing Jacob Suljak, Tomo Juricic and Ante Lasic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has certainly been making a most thorough inquiry into the repatriation system since the previous Government appointed him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has undertaken to provide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Senate to acknowledge that, although our society is changing, the cry of women’s lib is not an excuse for bypassing social and economic <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intervention of the law into such a relationship as this requires the application of the basic legal principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, certainty and practicability, which we always try to apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to pay tribute to the work of the  Chairman  of the Committee of Inquiry, the Right Honourable  Sir Owen  Woodhouse, D.S.C., of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and to his learned colleague, the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  C. L. D. Meares, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who is also  Chairman  of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These remedies have an important place in the history of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but they are both inadequate and unnecessarily expensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting and relevant to note that both  Sir Owen  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares, are outstanding representatives of a judiciary founded upon our English common law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that country it took some 6 years from the time the royal commission was appointed in 1966, under the chairmanship of the same gentleman to whom we are referring here-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse- until the Bill was presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse says that it is not necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that the law in this and in any other respect seeks to achieve the principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, certainty and practicability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen lawyers, who have sworn to uphold <span class="highlight">justice</span>, knowingly connive in this sort of charade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby’s view of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a single ground of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to deal with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby’s evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, Chief Judge of the Family Law Division of the N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However examination of the evidence given to the Committee by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby indicates that he does not support that view, and indeed supports the opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason that that situation is different from the question of breaking or dissolving a marriage, that the latter is so much more emotional, is because there is the matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the area of property, joint property which has been earned through joint effort which must be justly and reasonably settled and because, crucially, it is highly likely that the marriage will include a giving birth to children and the welfare of the children of the marriage must be paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite came in here after an arbitration was made, according to law, by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell about statutory offices and they disallowed that arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will give some illustrations of the injustices that we were subjected to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way I got <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the then Minister for the Interior was to deliberately park where I should not park and when I got my infringement notice I sent a copy to the Commissioner of Police in Sydney and another copy to Peter Nixon and said: ‘You can fight it out and do what you like’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All these books and all the material that is coming forward indicate that the utmost discrimination is being practised in the administration of the system of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a clear expression of their political views and their demand for <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You can make a mockery of the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and generally very little will be done about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever else the present Attorney-General may achieve, despite the Australian Senate, I believe that he will be able to look back- hopefully we will never turn the clock back- on the fact that this national Government recognised that if <span class="highlight">justice</span> was to continue to have the connotation which it has had in the past it would have to go hand in hand with a liberal legal aid system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just raced into this chamber to say that if we are going to have even-handed <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this matter I hope that the  President  of the Senate will inquire into this and look at the Cairns newspapers and National Party advertisements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that he has a knowledge of this subject but it is unfortunate that he cannot do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his people because of his political affiliations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reply, I believe, did neither <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Minister nor to the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams a servant of the Labor Government and its Leader and head of a tribunal which is not capable of acting, or allowed to act, independently? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult to work out a formula which takes recognition of this fact in the matter of maintenance when the marriage breaks down but in the matter of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> to almost half the citizens of our community this must be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the facts of working life in Australia and, in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, they must be considered by the Family Law Court or whichever court considers this Bill or any future Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst our society today may not have been responsible for it and may not have that point of view- it is a qualified statement on my part- our society must recognise the fact, must accept the responsibility and must be prepared to pay the cost, if purely in terms of simple <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the recommendation that there be a further provision inserted in subclause (2) of clause 54 to the effect that any fact or circumstance which in the opinion of the court the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case requires to be taken into account be included in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out situations where, on the actual wording of the Bill, we could have an unjust case if we looked only at need, that there is need for a flexible provision in this clause which would enable the court to deal in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present situation leads to all manner of injustices and abuse by individuals in the situation where the marriage has already irretrievably broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all else, because it is the key to anybody’s concern with a Bill relating to the family or divorce, we have to give the means for <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a decent life to the really innocent parties- the children of those broken down marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sales line for this Bill was that the Chief Judge in Divorce in New South Wales, a very respected person,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, had allegedly argued for one ground, and that one ground was irretrievable breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that this Senate and the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs have not sought to put the situation right, because for whatever reason the Committee’s report presented a part of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby ‘s evidence in such a way that he at least feels that he has been misrepresented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will read what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby said in evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby is quoted as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the record be right:  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby now says that he believes that there should be a number of grounds, a number of tests for divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal processes require the application of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, certainty and practicability or, as the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  has said, they should be designed to buttress rather than undermine the stability of marriage, and when the breakdown occurs the processes should take place with the maximum fairness, the minimum bitterness and the minimum distress and humiliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am greatly attracted by the  reference  in the Standing Committee’s report in relation to the Family Law Bill to the evidence given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Burnett of Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be terminated with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties but with paramount consideration being given to the interests of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can imagine what sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be obtained in that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have not been able to adjust your business in such a way as tq give some sort of economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> to your worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they have not resulted from the inquiry being undertaken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose because the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose are still as yet not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to let us have his report by the end of March next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose was instituted by the previous Government, and the term of the inquiry has been extended by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it could fairly be said that in many respects the administration of the system and the legislation regulating the system are perhaps unnecessarily complicated, and it is on these matters that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose is reporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has delivered his report to the Government I shall see that the Parliament is informed of what  His  Honour has recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other case with regard to divorce and matrimonial causes the only judge of the Court still remaining with it,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies, made it quite clear that the matrimonial causes jurisdiction does not have the width of meaning and interpretation given to it by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not know what the remaining 6 judges will say, but if lawyers are to approach this matter in terms of what the power might contain they obviously would look to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope honourable senators will bear with me, if they consider themselves judicial, and listen to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies said in the case of Lansell v. Lansell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators would expect, very much attention has been paid and most serious consideration has been given to what has been said by the court, including what was said by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Menzies in his dissenting judgment in the case to which  Senator Greenwood  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is an adequate treatment of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies said simply to dismiss it as lacking any real substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kitto expressed the view this aspect was adverted to by the authors- that many of the powers which were given under the 1959 Act could well be regarded as powers with regard to property, not with regard to marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It leads to great expense and no <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Marriage Act case in which the High Court considered questions involving the extent of the marriage power <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Taylor was inclined to give a wide interpretation to the term “marriage’, as was <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Menzies who said: ‘The power must extend to the mutual rights and the obligations of spouses unless it be that State laws could deprive that marriage, according to Commonwealth law, of any legal significance except for Commonwealth purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not beyond the resources of this country to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> in matrimonial affairs to remote parts of the continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is frequently not done when parties cannot afford to have a lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The office which U Thant held has been described with <span class="highlight">justice</span> as the most impossible job in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in family law matters should be even-handed across Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe such a Court will provide <span class="highlight">justice</span>, compassion and help and put Australia in the forefront of family law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount spent on <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this community is very slight indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would not want to have this new system administered in the same courts as civil and criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being administered unless that were necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A judge shall, before proceeding to discharge the duties of his office, take, before the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia or a Judge of the Family Court or of another court created by the Parliament, an oath or affirmation in the following form: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the public would come to regard the situation which would be created under this beneficial legislation as one in which there were 2 sets of <span class="highlight">justice</span>- one Federal and superior and one State and inferior or second class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things are all very confusing for individuals in this community who are concerned about one thinghaving their matrimonial problems resolved with the maximum of speed, the maximum of dignity and the maximum of <span class="highlight">justice</span> particularly to children involved in matrimonial disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he suggesting that State <span class="highlight">justice</span> is inferior to Federal <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the State Supreme Courts have had a very fine record in this country in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that many people I know would prefer to receive appointments to State Supreme Courts than to some new Federal court which has not yet proved its record in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some Overseas Departments of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments permit an Aboriginal or Islander to terminate the management of his property by notice in writing witnessed by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Queensland law provides merely for an appeal to a district officer and to a visiting <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When he gave evidence -some time ago now-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Selby, who was the first witness to appear before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, stressed the point that people really must be encouraged to work at their marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe 12 months gives <span class="highlight">justice</span> in terms of not being too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the case of Porter v. Porter in South Australia which was decided by Her Honour <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances in which Porter v. Porter was decided, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell said that if the facts met the test- that is, that people living under the one roof were still able to establish the ground of separation- that ground can be shown to have been proved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the language of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell in Porter v. Porter and the language of the majority of the court in New South Wales in Crabtree v. Crabtree would permit that type of interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care whether one looks at the book which was edited by the Attorney-General’s adviser,  Mr Watson,  together with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and  Dr Benjafield,  whether one looks at  Mr Finlay  ‘s volume or whether one looks at the other writings of the academic writers, but there is generally accepted to be a very real area of doubt as to what is the proper material upon which a court should decide whether or not separation has been established between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any fact or circumstances which in the opinion ofthe Court the <span class="highlight">justice</span> ofthe case requires to be taken into account ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well envisage a situation in which, in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and in order to settle a matter of marital property- this is the matter at which we have been looking- a person may be forced to take proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a situation which in all <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that she should still have some rights to maintenance from her former husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Insert the following new clause: 17c A Judge shall, before proceeding to discharge the duties of his office, take, before the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia or a Judge of the Family Court or of another court created by the Parliament, an oath or affirmation of allegiance in the form in the Schedule to the Constitution and also an oath or affirmation in the following form- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A judge shall, before proceeding to discharge the duties of his office, take, before the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia or a Judge of the Family Court or of another court created by the Parliament, an oath or affirmation of allegiance in the form in the schedule to the Constitution and also an oath or affirmation in the following form: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular in regard to what constitutes a separation and living apart it does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to what ought to be the proper determination of the one ground which is involved in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that not only the Government but also everybody in this House views with very great concern any situation anywhere in which the fundamental rules of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, including the right to a fair and independent trial, are abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, as was mentioned in the other place, recommends that the Jess Committee or its equivalent be reestablished in order to check on the anomalies and to bring, as we call it, <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a lot of those people who retired prior to the new scheme coming into effect on 1 October 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is still argued that it is a continuous process between the Commonwealth and the States to seek to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> and some form of equality of living standards and opportunity in the Australian scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So the call for <span class="highlight">justice</span> is a very strong one in South Australia on behalf of rural landholders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward presented his second report in May of this year, and the Government accepted its recommendations in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward suggested that such funds should be seen as providing compensation in the form of useful land to those Aboriginals who have lost their lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose one may cite the case of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question which is directed to the Attorney-General relates to the refusal of the Secretary of the Seamen’s Union of Australia,  Mr E.  V.

  <li>
    <p>The High Commissioner will have responsibility for the appointment of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and such other judges and acting judges as are required and for other matters relating to the qualifications of judges and to the tenure of judges’ appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s belief in social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which has been demonstrated by massive inputs to our social welfare program, opens up the possibility of programs such as this leading to a diminution of the problem through the rehabilitation of this group of the socially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will lead to policies which will lead to a LiberalCountry Party government in this country and in that way financial measures will do fair <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the States in the future and will not be a matter of dole and charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One speaks of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They bear little relation to our laws or our sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a misdirection of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to force, by laws, our lawyers into this simple setting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the conduct of the most important case that Australia has ever had, what is said to be the greatest case that has ever been in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, his work has been of extreme value to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new Queensland laws now provide that an Aboriginal or Islander may terminate the management of his property by notice in writing witnessed by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee, set up in 1 972 under the Chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey was charged with inquiring into the ‘structure and operation of the present Commonwealth taxation system ‘ and formulating proposals for its improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-71-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, with the existence of the Northern Territory Reserves Board, with the existence of the new Legislative Assembly and with the report of the Joint Committee, one feels that there is utter <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the complaints that come in very strong terms, particularly from  Dr Goff  Letts, the majority leader in the Assembly, saying: ‘Why are we not consulted, why are we not being taken into partnership and why do you not delay this measure until you have consulted with us?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Federal Opposition believes emphatically that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has <span class="highlight">justice</span> on its side in this complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely as a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span> we should be fair and let the tribunal decide the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Alan  Mann gave the best years of his life as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsequent Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Minogue, has likewise done a tremendous work in developing the prestige of that Court and in ensuring that throughout that Territory the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Territory, the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the government and the law which the Government represents has been able to be recognised and to be enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate of the following changes which have been made in the Ministry following the appointment of the Honourable L. K. Murphy, Q.C, as a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court: Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Agriculture,  Senator the  Honourable K. S. Wriedt; Attorney- General and Minister for Customs and Excise, the Honourable Kep Enderby; Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Senator the  Honourable Jim McClelland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the statement of the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, that decisions by the Prices Justification Tribunal had delayed the movement towards conciliation between unions and employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a royal commission of some kind would bring to light not only the atrocities which are being perpetrated against Aborigines and of which  Senator Keeffe  has spoken but also the fact that there are occasions when members of law enforcement agencies need to chastise and bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> Aborigines who are not doing the right thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So surely a royal commission in this area would serve the purpose of making us all satisfied that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only will seem to be carried out but also will be carried out because those who are responsible for the enforcement of the law will know that if they are not administering <span class="highlight">justice</span> as they should there is a likelihood of someone bringing them to book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I approached  Mr Maddison,  the then Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in New South Wales, with the proposal that we should have a conference between the police and the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As a preliminary matter I would suggest to honourable senators that it is about time that they became accustomed to calling the new <span class="highlight">justice</span> by his correct title, he having now received his commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  correct title is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, and I propose to refer to him in that style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I believe that the question does not arise as to the propriety of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy sitting on the Bench which will consider this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One need only consider the position of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer who had been elevated to the Commonwealth Industrial Court, or the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration as it was then called, and who was called upon almost immediately to sit in judgment on the validity of an Act which had recently been amended according to his own efforts in this Parliament to get it amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after he had piloted these amendments through this Parliament,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer sat on several matters involving the validity of trade union elections and obviously felt no embarrassment in adjudicating on legislation which he had helped to pilot through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Garfield  Barwick, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, also sat and adjudicated on matters which had been considered in this Parliament when he was Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to advert finally to a suggestion from  Senator Scott  reflecting on the propriety of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy sitting in judgment on his own legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Despite the dissenting judgment from  ‘Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’  Wright, Professor Sawer has suggested that an appropriate mix in the highest court of this country is, say, 4 technical lawyers- what the lawyers refer to as lawyers’ lawyers- and 3 lawyers who have had political experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this he is supported by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Garfield  Barwick who himself was a distinguished practitioner of the political arts, who went on to high office in the High Court and who has said on more than one occasion that political experience, far from disqualifying a lawyer from the exercise of his judicial functions, adds spice and flavour to his consideration of the problems that come before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Latham;  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer, whom I consider to have been a conspicuous success in the Australian Industrial Court and who, I might say, many people from the trade unions and from the other side of the political fence concede to have been a just, impartial and sensible judge; and of course more recently,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen who went to the Appeals Court of New South Wales only 3 months after having been reelected to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who knew  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy- I suggest that includes most honourable senators opposite- will have no doubt that he will be a distinguished, fair and impartial judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side, and I am sure in their hearts most honourable senators on the other side, wish  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy well and in our hearts believe that he will be a fine judge as he was a fine politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that his attitude in supporting the Queensland attack on one vote one value as a principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian community was something that could be excused as a new Premier’s enthusiasm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to refer on this issue to what was said by the present Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Snedden,  when he was AttorneyGeneral in 1 964 on the occasion of the swearingin of the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By pure coincidence three of your Honour’s predecessors as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who had earlier held political office alternated in succession with three others who had not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three who had held political office were Chief Justices Griffith, Isaacs and Latham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between their respective terms of office came the Chief Justiceships of Knox, Gavan Duffy and Dixon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in a tribute to the late  Sir John  Latham who died on the 25 July 1964, referred to the very extensive political career of  Sir John  Latham, who as honourable senators know was appointed directly from Attorney-Generalship of the Commonwealth by the Government of which he was a member to the Chief Justiceship ofthe High Court in 1935. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir John Latham thus brought to the performance of the duties of the office of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> a wide and varied experience of public and international affairs and a familiarity with the working of the Australian Constitution gleaned both in the days of his practice at the Bar and in government during his term as a Cabinet Minister and as a parliamentarian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do so is to confer on them, as well as on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, a gratuitous insult which is completely unjustified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anyone suggest that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Denning, now Lord Denning, was not a complete adornment to the courts through which he marched in England over a period of some decades? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in a few years time the Australian public and the legal profession will recognise in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy the counterpart of Lord Denning of England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard  Senator Button  refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy as a prince. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has moved an amendment asking the Senate, now that it has entered upon a discussion of the filling of the casual vacancy following the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, to affirm, as mentioned in paragraph ( 1 ) of the amendment, that the choice of a senator to fill a casual vacancy is, by section 15 of the Constitution, the sole responsibility of the Houses of Parliament of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pass by those scurrilous references made about the Leader of the Opposition and I pass by those immature attempts to praise the outgoing senator, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to talk for more than a few sentences o’n the propriety of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He raised the question of the propriety of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s appointment to the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable senator does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to  Mr Mwaanga  when he says that he is threatening war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is a power that he will have, but does the honourable senator think that the Minister wants to deprive anyone of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think most honourable senators are aware that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose of the Supreme Court of New South Wales was commissioned by the previous Government to conduct an inquiry into all aspects of the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several extensions of time have been granted to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his wideranging inquiries into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have any idea what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose may recommend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have assured both the Returned Services League and the Australian Services Council, which represents all or nearly all the veterans’ organisations other than the RSL, that they will have a full opportunity to examine and discuss any recommendations which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose may make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly if the Government does act on recommendations from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose it would be only after it has had consultation with the ex-service organisations involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The committees were initiated by our predecessors- in 1 956 on the motion in the House of Representatives of the then Prime Minister,  Mr Menzies  as he then was, and reconstituted in 1958 on the motion in that House of the then Leader of the House,  Mr Holt  and reconstituted again in 1959 on the motion in that House of the AttorneyGeneral and now Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and time again the quality of the justices of the High Court and the excellence of their legal learning have been extolled by English-speaking lawyersindeed, by members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last year, the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham- the second Lord Hailsham of that name- made a visit to Australia for the specific purpose of attending the 150th anniversary of the proclamation of the Charter of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, by which the Supreme Court of that State was constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It accepts the need to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and that there is no decision of the Commission that is above scrutiny or criticism, but the amendment is not a solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absolute is that when we rebuild Darwin as speedily as possible <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall be done, and the desires and needs of the people shall be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If under the alibi of absolute urgency the Government seeks to railroad the people’s rights, <span class="highlight">justice</span> will not be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> was done in the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge there have been only 2 judicial investigations into Aboriginal land rights, one by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn at Gove and one more recently by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Furnell in a Royal Commission in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that this Government was elected on 2 December 1972 and that on 15 December, within the first fortnight of operation of the Government, the Prime Minister issued a Press statement announcing the setting up of a judicial inquiry into the legal recognition of Aboriginal land rights and the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to conduct the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward’s commission is not concerned with whether rights in land should be granted since the Government has already decided that they shall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the Prime Minister continued: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s decision those who have tribal claims to land or those groups of Aborigines which claim long residential rights to land are now the subject of investigation by the Central Lands Committee and the Northern Lands Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said that it would be improper, while he was conducting an inquiry, for the Government to make arrangements to give land rights to the Gurindji people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Owen  Dixon, made it completely clear that the Commonwealth has an almost unfettered power to impose conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me finish this section of my speech by quoting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullagar, who put the matter in even simpler and clearer terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the royal commission to be conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope into, among other things, the purpose, function, administration and staffing of Australian security services will commence in Sydney on 5 March 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember the case involving  Sir Garfield  Barwick, a very fine type of person and now the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As everyone is aware  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose is at present inquiring into all aspects of the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the High Court of Australia was able to co-ordinate the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the State courts were enabled to take their part in each field, both in their original State jurisdiction and in the invested Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should state that no doubt it will be urged by the proponents of the Bill that this Bill had its analogy in Bills which were previously suggested to the Parliament by  Sir Garfield  Barwick,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, MrT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a signal contribution that  Senator Greenwood  made when he was Attorney-General to come to a final conclusion that a proposal of this sort was damaging in the extreme to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia and he announced to the Parliament that the Bill was to go to the waste paper basket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy,  now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, following on that idea in this place, had the notion when this Bill was promoted that there would be a court so magnificent, so comprehensive and so overriding that the Federal jurisdiction would overshadow the State jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are accustomed now in this Parliament and elsewhere to acclaim with honour Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon of the High Court whenever his name is mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superficially, no doubt, it appeared a natural thing for the new government to include courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But neither from the point of view of juristic principle nor from that of the practical and efficient administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> can the division of the courts into State and federal be regarded as sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want now to make reference to the statement that  His  Honour made on taking his oath of office as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Honour had also made great contribution to this cause in the evidence which he submitted before the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1929, presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nicholas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However effectual such provisions may be for ensuring that the High Court retains an almost exclusive authority to declare the meaning and effect of the Constitution, no one can fail to see that this is done at the expense of rendering almost futile and impossible the practical administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the purpose of adjusting the real controversies between subject and subject or redressing real grievances which a subject may have against the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are also fortunate in that as recently as 1 8 February- this month- reported in the Melbourne ‘Age’ are passages attributed to the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the State of New South Wales,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  (Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Street)  said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said this was necessary if the court system was to cope effectively with the strains of the future, particularly in the ad ministration of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Street was speaking during the opening the 1 975 sittings of the N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In continuing his appeal,  Mr Radich  went to the Supreme Court which upheld the Court of Appeals on a vote of 4 to 4, with Associate <span class="highlight">Justice</span> William O. Douglas not voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than follow the unfortunate proposal contained in this Bill I think that it is imperative to take heed now of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon said and what I have read to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential purpose of the Bill is to create a coherent judicial system for the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> at a national level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, the court should demonstratably be a true reflection of accepted principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth criterion 1 would postulate is that in the interpretation of national laws it should reflect within the area of judicial power the proud spirit of a nation in which <span class="highlight">justice</span> and its expression are paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fifthly, it will take all Australian citizens- I emphasise that we are all citizens of Australia- along a path of even-handed <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to see it the vehicle for evenhanded <span class="highlight">justice</span> throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have said that he based virtually his whole case on the views expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, later  Sir Owen  Dixon, which had so little charm for the Liberal Party when in government that it discarded them and, after all the opposition to this Bill that could be raised over a period of 6 years had been sifted, the then Attorney-General  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen was able to say that all the objections had been examined, there was nothing in any of them and the Government was going ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He rested his opposition partly on the fact that, in his words, a system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> ought to be simple, prompt and economic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who could utter that last night now advocates a simple, prompt and economic system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will consist of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and other judges appointed from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is envisaged that such a court would streamline the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and establish a coherent national judicial system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the full support of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Government has decided that it should follow the alternative course, which is available under the Constitution, of investing State Supreme Courts and the Supreme Courts of the mainland Territories with original jurisdiction in certain additional federal matters in respect of which the High Court now exercises original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might refer to my own State of Victoria as an example, whatever the Hamer-makes-it-happen Government may have done in Victoria- and I cannot think of a single thing at the moment- it certainly has not speeded up the process of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before those interjections about Tasmania came my way, I was making the point that the establishment of the Superior Court would enable the State Supreme Courts to get on with the areas of their exclusive jursidiction and catch up on some of the chronic delays which are existing in those areas which result in the denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to so many citizens and litigants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In consultation with the States it will examine ways in which efficient, modern and less time-consuming procedures may be developed and Commonwealth support and assistance may be provided to maintain confidence in our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not in the mediaeval period when barons and hierarchies felt they needed to have their own courts in which matters could be dealt with because they did not trust the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of other people who lived just 10 miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a backlog of work now in the single <span class="highlight">justice</span> jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An administrative system which is supposed to simplify and provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people who have objection against government administrative decisions will contain a mass of appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to bear in mind that judges in the existing courts go on circuit in the States and bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> nearer to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From  Senator Wright  there was the jurisdic and legal approach; that does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to what he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From  Senator Sheil  there was essentially a practical and historical approach, and that does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to what he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From  Senator Missen  we have had an eminently practical argument against this proposal when viewed from the basis of whether it will do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the ordinary citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the fact that in the work which the court must perform it must distinguish between State and Federal laws and occasionally between State and Federal jurisdiction, litigants do not find that the <span class="highlight">justice</span> which they receive in the courts of this country depends upon whether the court is exercising State or Federal jurisdiction or is applying Federal or State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not make it appear that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task of the courts is to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all who appear before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State courts, apart from the High Court which is primarily an appeal court for all the State Supreme Courts, have been dispensers of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for 70 years since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will involve many appointments of judges and the erection or rental of new court buildings not only in the capital cities but also in the provincial centres to which the courts must be able to go if they are to provide <span class="highlight">justice</span> on the same basis that the State courts provide <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this will occur without any real savings in costs or improvements in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and with the twin risks of dissatisfaction on the part of the litigants and an unsatisfactory image for the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who, when he was Attorney-General, had favoured the proposal has also indicated that he sees merit in a different type of approach today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the full support of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference there is to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court -  the Government has decided that it should follow the alternative course, which is available under the Constitution, of investing State Supreme Courts and the Supreme Courts of the mainland Territories with original jurisdiction in certain additional Federal matters in respect of which the High Court now exercises original jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One faction was very cleverly advised, as it so happens by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as he now is, of the possibilities involved in this dual identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One set of union officials for which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, who was then  Mr Murphy,  Q.C., acted was defeated in a trade union ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not be unreal enough to think that judges are completely immune from politics, that they do not attempt to ensure that a system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, as they see it, is perpetuated and that they do not resist change which they think involves some territorial encroachment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is altogether without some significance that the opinions of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick are slightly different from the opinions of Attorney-General Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick has territory to defend just as judges of the State supreme courts have territory to defend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also tested public opinion by publishing an article on this subject in which I suggested that a good deal of social and industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be achieved if we could insert into this type of legislation a requirement for voting along the lines of parliamentary procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the point of view that  Senator Coleman  is taking, but at present we are waiting on a report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose on the whole structure of the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After consideration of the request made by members of the Bench during the National Wage case the ACTU executive makes the following statement: The trade union movement strongly believes the introduction of wage indexation to be a vital element in securing economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the great bulk of the Australian community dependent directly or indirectly upon wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the ACTU point of view the pursuit of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> has historically been a  two-fold  process- those major aspect* to which the ACTU itself has assumed collective responsibilities and those which have remained within the province of the individual unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the case is determined will be the time when a proper approach by the Government to the ACTU might be more satisfactory and a resumption of the conferences under the control of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore more fruitful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore called a conference in August of last year he had the expectation that with the support of the Government and the unions an agreed compromise could be hammered out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would have resulted in a monopoly situation and, if implemented, would have constituted in my opinion a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I express my gratitude that the former Attorney-General, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, and the Government recognised the problems that would have been created by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We spent a number of hours talking to the previous AttorneyGeneral, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, and to the previous Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Mr Enderby,  and put a very strong case to both of them in support of the amendment which we now have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should not be the responsibility of the politicians of this country to have to interfere and determine whether <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will do whatever I can for him within the limits of my ministerial responsibility and I hope that eventually some <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done, but whether it be through the arbitral proceedings or in some other way 1 do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It required a resolution from our former colleague,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, to have even a committee established to inquire into the problems with which we are dealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a great deal of investigation on my part I believe that what I raise tonight is a gross miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where does an Aborigine go for <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> must not only seem to be done; in my opinion, <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> for aborigines …. as long as they arrest someone and get a conviction, they are happy <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I ask: Where does an Aboriginal go for <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question I keep asking is: Where does an Aborigine go for <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the things that the grandfather tried to do, there seems to be nowhere that an Aborigine can go for <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me read another letter written by the grandfather,  Mr Les  Davidson, to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am an Aborigine and to whom do I turn (in fact any citizen turn) when it is firmly believed that there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and an innocent man convicted of a crime? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my firm conviction that while one person is wrongfully convicted of a crime and good people do nothing then <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not being served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> was certainly not served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia, Aborigines have tried all types of avenues seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span>; perhaps we’ve been wrong at times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is not only a case of trial by newspapers but also a case of a gross miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he has actually done is condemn the police system of Queensland, the judiciary of Queensland, the magistrates of Queensland, the Supreme Court of Queensland, the whole set-up of the BjelkePetersen administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Queensland and the honourable senator’s organisation of legal aid in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> I am very sorry about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> it is due to the whole legal system in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an article in this week’s issue of the ‘Bulletin’ reflecting on the qualifications of the staff of a former Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister know the names and qualifications of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s staff? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I would invite honourable senators to conclude that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy has probably the best qualified staff of all the High Court judges and I would hope that this magazine the ‘Bulletin’ will now have the common decency to call off its vendetta against  His  Honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until in the last few years  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Windeyer adverted to the limitations- shall I say- of that doctrine and the possibility that there should be more flexibility in ascribing to the persons who promote a juristic corporation agency for the principal natural persons we had that doctrine very arbitrarily applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He named  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pay and related conditions of service already have been referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Coldham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of the Expert Group,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares, summed up the position very well when speaking recently in Albury-Wodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it is democracy and in fact it is what we have now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be supported by every honourable senator on the Government side who believes in <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is interested in electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> it will not press those sections of the Bill which seek electoral advantage for a particular party or for the present parties at the expense of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the type of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> the Labor Party wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact the speed with which the result is arrived at is important only if in the process we lose nothing of democratic <span class="highlight">justice</span> or democratic fairness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any delay in processing the application for the votes or in returning the votes then electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is lessened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no real <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the rather draconian restrictions which are proposed in relation to those aspects of postal voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optional preferential voting would be a disadvantage because it would adversely affect the electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> which our voting system would give us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those parts of this Bill which aim to improve the electoral process we will support; those parts which diminish electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> we will oppose, and in so doing we will seek to do our proper job of protecting our community and ensuring that electoral results reflect the wishes of that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume said that the system we use today- the full preferential system- is a just system and that, if we departed from it, <span class="highlight">justice</span> would be assaulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, detailed legislation in this matter could in many cases inadvertently bind those whose task it will be to apportion compensation to decisions which may not be in keeping with the real interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will give a decided advantage to the parties already existing and perpetuate the very grave injustice that exists today in regard to the time allocated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, for instance, when campaigning is under way for Federal and State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our electoral support and electoral possibilities in this community we have to take some action to make sure that in future the ABC acts fairly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At another time and on another occasion I would like to see something done to rectify the very grave injustices in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see an absolute need to clear up this situation so that there may be <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the confused situation in both Cambodia and Vietnam now at this very late stage I think that all governments, whatever indirect influences they have- I do not think any outside governments have any direct influences on the situationshould be urging both sides, anybody at all who has anything to do with the fighting, that whatever the outcome they try to bind their wounds and at least try to show some mercy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to one another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that at least some day before I leave here I will see <span class="highlight">justice</span> done by Opposition senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fitting that I should enter this debate because, unlike the former AttorneyGeneral, not long ago I testified before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on aspects of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within 48 hours of my asking for his file, <span class="highlight">justice</span> was done and he had citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone who feels that an injustice has been done has a perfect right to bring it up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an honourable senator wants a reply and to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done when he feels that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been done he should inform the Minister representing the Minister what he intends speaking about so that some <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be achieved for the individual whom it is claimed has been deprived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not want in the case of  Mr Pavlovic  or the other case to which he referred to get the <span class="highlight">justice</span> he claims has been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>up for political reasons and had no intention of getting <span class="highlight">justice</span> for what he said was a matter of injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not want <span class="highlight">justice</span> for individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done: it must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are based on the principle that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only should be done but also should be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the departmental officers will be able to raise all sorts of interesting reasons why it should not be introduced; but, if we are talking about giving electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, people in remote areas ought to be able to have a postal vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No point has been made to indicate any extra electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> or any great value to the electoral system in cutting back the hours of polling by the 2 hours proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say again, as we have said before, that getting a quicker result is no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, is meaningless and is, in the end, unimportant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want answers as to where the electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is in cutting the hours of polling back to 6 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that nobody with political experience would think that a committee of this chamber, or the whole Parliament, with all the political pressures and interests there are from that scene, could adjudicate with any degree of propriety upon a matter such as this, requiring as it does an acute understanding of the law and a fair exercise of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in temper and spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having mentioned that, I want to say as to a reference of a case such as this that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be applied equally, and <span class="highlight">justice</span> is always on a very delicate balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">justice</span> according to law- according to law, but fundamentally <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak on the basis of obtaining <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which the motion and the amendment are not obtaining today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to add to the motion an amendment which will attempt to bring some relative <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right as the basis of the Labor Party’s proposal in relation to  Senator Webster,  but it is below the dignity of a senator to be involved in obtaining relative <span class="highlight">justice</span> for  Senator Webster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move my amendment to obtain what I believe is a minimum of <span class="highlight">justice</span>- to make sure that  Senator Webster’s  position is quite clear and his case should go to the High Court but not until the judicial committee has reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do otherwise in this matter is to join in the most unsavoury single minded attempt to subvert <span class="highlight">justice</span> instead of to apply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support both the motion and the amendment without reservation, and I do so because I believe that, so far as it is within the competence of the Senate, that will enable <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done, the law to be upheld and the institution of Parliament to be upheld and respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that I wish to point out is that the Government has done all that it possibly can to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done in this Parliament in respect of the matter now under dicussion, We have accepted the amendment that was moved by  Senator Withers  in respect of a judicial inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years there have been divergent views expressed about the merits and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of a financial system which envisages the collection of revenue by one government and its expenditure by others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have consistently taken the stand and discussed with members of Parliament my thoughts on the issue of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to elected people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen that the Bill will thus preserve the common informer procedure provided for by the Constitution, while modifying its application in a way that will be more in keeping with modern times and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this time has long since passed and as  Senator Wheeldon  must agree that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has had ample time to prepare the report, can the Minister now say when the report will be tabled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must admit that I do remember the question very clearly indeed and I do remember saying at the time that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose had been asked whether he could present his report to the Parliament by 3 1 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then I have had a number of conversations with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Remuneration and allowances of five members of the Commission are stipulated in Part V. Clause 26 provides that the  President  will receive a salary of $41,000 per annum, which is equivalent to a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court; and other members a salary of $35,000 which is equivalent to a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was with that in mind that the Liberal-Country Party Government set up a special committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares with many eminent people on it including  Mr Pak-Poy  from Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator rightly pointed to the more or less basic study entitled ‘The Road Accident Situation in Australia ‘, which was an important review issued in September 1972 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can any Government justify a surrender of the power to control its railways as Tasmania has done when, if there is any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the country on the financial basis upon which States should be supported, this Commonwealth Government is bound to render financial assistance to Tasmania to enable it to run the railway services it thinks sufficient so that the economy of those railways is not too much out of line with other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister, in his capacity as the Minister representing the Attorney-General who is responsible for the administration of the Matrimonial Causes Act, give the Senate, in the interests of fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span>, any information which he has regarding this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be remembered that some years ago  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose was commissioned by the previous Government to prepare a report on the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently other problems have occurred in the meantime, which I do not altogether follow, and thus have prevented  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose from presenting the report by 30 March although he told me that part of the report has been now sent to the printer and another part of it is in draft form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the decision to which we came- I think that there are good reasons for doing it and I think that those good reasons were explained in the second reading speech- was that what we are trying to do is to see that decisions are made which are in keeping with the real interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6 May 1 975 and note that His Honour the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> intends to sit as the Court of Disputed Returns on 19 May 1975 for the purpose of considering the questions referred by the Senate to the Court pursuant to section 204 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-1973 and referred to in my letter dated 24 April 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that we have made it completely clear not only to the Soviet Union but also to every other country that the loss of civil liberties or the gaolings which are not really acceptable in other countriesI speak, quite generally now- make for difficulties in our relationships with those countries because the Australian public who are used to a form of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> do not accept these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, when Tasmania was bedevilled by navigational difficulties, inequalities, and pressures from unions and others way back in 1920, it is not surprising to find that quite a considerable body of opinion on the royal commission of 1929, ably assisted by the late Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Nicholas, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Equity in New South Wales, when he was equity counsel at the Bar of Sydney, propounded a view in favour of the Inter-State Commission and mentioned amongst ot her things the effect of the Navigation Act on various States as an appropriate subject of inquiry, very pertinent to the interests which I am sent here to represent, namely, Tasmania in particular and her navigational difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The very basis of the ruling by Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon, under section 92 of the Constitution that the States were refusing, through that road law, to allow transport to be absolutely free, was the fact that the States endeavoured, by a licensing system, to say, ‘Smith, you can run there: Jones, you shall have no licence. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is pertinent in that context that I should quote to the Senate what was said by a former Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Latham, in the Riverina transport case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had thought that one might have said in all <span class="highlight">justice</span> and accuracy that the reverse had been the case- that the hysteria had come from another source and that there had been just a few sideswipes from the Government of an understandable and a very accurate nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the last part of the honourable senator’s question, I readily assent to the proposition that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we talk about fairness and electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>, there ought to have been a redistribution in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that when I resume my seat the Senate will be delivered a lecture by  Senator Hall  on fairness, equity, electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and all the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic reason we are opposed to the whole series of these redistributions is because they are not designed to bring about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as a matter of simple electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> you would not carry out a redistribution under an Act which may well be declared to be invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have imagined that any government that had any real interest in electoral reform, electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and electoral equality would have waited until the determination of that question before the High Court before ordering a redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that honourable senators opposite will say that it is fair, it is reasonable and it has brought electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the life of me, I cannot see how it has brought electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> to anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would imagine that the boundaries as distributed in South Australia at present so grossly favour either the Liberal Party or the Labor Party that they ought to be redistributed to bring about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the 2 parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is a premature presentation in the sense of political power and I think that the power structure will shift away from the Opposition in the Senate next year to a third middle group which will ensure that electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> is provided for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, they opted for a marginal short-term political advantage and for a mockery of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that in this field our great ally, the Liberal Party of Australia, is in agreement with us when we say that if we are to have electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in redistributions proper consideration must be given to equality of electoral representation and that one vote one value of itself is relatively meaningless if you divorce value from effective representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion is that one vote one value is the real contributor to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this the sort of arrangement that the Government means when it refers to electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  I am suggesting is simply that you have made a passing reference but the fundamental question that we are debating is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the injustice of electoral redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all those circumstances and having convinced  Senator Wheeldon  entirely of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case  I  have put I am sure that not only will all of the Opposition senators be voting against this redistibution but also  Senator Wheeldon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do believe that comparable treatment will be achieved and therefore <span class="highlight">justice</span> will not be denied, although I would like it to be pursued in the manner provided by the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government of India declared that for reference of any dispute in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, for decision in terms of article 22 of the International Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the consent of all parties to the dispute is necessary in each individual case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contempt of court is not involved unless the comment is of such a kind and made in such circumstances as to have the effect of interfering with the proper administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that the proposals of the Distribution Commissioners for Victoria represent a thorough-going attempt to provide the citizens of that State with electoral boundaries which will go a great distance towards the achievement of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> for all voters and political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view on the question of safety and industrial conditions whereby accident prevention may be encouraged is more along the lines of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares which recommended the establishment of a national safety office and provision of adequate penalties by way of prosecution for those people who breach safety rules, rather than by the imposition of differential rates of premiums on the various insured persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Higgins who in his province for law and order said: ‘The system of arbitration adopted by the Act is based on unionism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was many months after the dispute began that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson, backed up by authorities, proved on the ground of safety that the original objection by the union was vindicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deny that fact is to abandon the aim of seeking to win political and economic power, which is the only way which the working class will end exploitation and reform society to achieve an equitable redistribution of wealth and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is why I ask how the Government can in <span class="highlight">justice</span> ratify this Convention when it does not propose to carry out the obligations which the Convention imposes, except by preferring one aspect of the Convention over another aspect of the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It takes out of the clause what the Senate put into the Bill, clause 75 (2) (n), which provided that any fact or circumstance which on the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the case required to be considered was the final consideration under this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is the contrary position of a husband who may have reasons why <span class="highlight">justice</span> would not require a court to make an order and that can be considered at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest with respect that  Senator Greenwood  would do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to this Bill by forgetting about  Mr Grassby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir MAGNUS CORMACK (Victoria) (2.57)- I intrude in this debate not on the basis of a lawyer but simply as a citizen of this country who has been reared in the traditions and concepts of what are the rights and privileges of the citizen against administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not trying to do anything except convince the government of the day that they needed <span class="highlight">justice</span> in respect of their tribal land rights, the health of their children, employment opportunities and better health for the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it seeks to amend the Act to enable a  chairman  such as the existing  Chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else Mitchell, who immediately prior to his appointment as  Chairman,  was a judge of a Federal or State court, to have the same designation, rank, status and precedence as a judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing, nothing that I say should be taken as a reflection upon the incumbent  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rae Else-Mitchell, whom I am privileged to know and whose work I respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that without casting any reflection on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rae Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will achieve all that we ask, while giving to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell all the privileges that he had previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, who sponsored this Bill as a senator in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy can no doubt take great credit and great pride in his contribution, by his persistence, by his preparedness to listen to representations and by his handling of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 17 March 1975 Australia deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations an Instrument withdrawing its declaration of 6 February 1954 and substituting a new declaration under paragraph 2 of Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In April 1973, the Australian Government set up a Committee of Inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a committee presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, who is now the Governor-General, and had as its members  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason, now of the High Court and then the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, and Professor Whitmore of the Australian National University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason ceased to be Solicitor-General he was replaced on this Committee by  Mr Ellicott,  who was then the SolicitorGeneral, now the honourable member for Wentworth in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I should like to make is that this Bill, in one giant stride, sweeps away the past efforts to give true <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the field of administrative law and replaces them with one tribunal, admittedly operating of necessity in divisions, and exercising whatever jurisdiction Parliament confers on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that it may well be that some amendment of those formal words may be made during the Committee stage, but the point is that the whole concept of the Bill is to provide for review of decisions on their merits and that being the case the public is able to have confidence that arbitrary decisions will not be made, that decisions that are unreasoned, contrary to fact, unreasonable or otherwise such as from any sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will not be bound by mere matters of law; <span class="highlight">justice</span> will prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Superannuation Bill 1975 offers benefits which are eminently satisfactory, wherein the provisions acknowledge the importance of the quality, dedication and real value of the work of Australian Public Servants, mirrors community requirements, secures <span class="highlight">justice</span> for Australian Public Servants and their dependants and establishes a realistic standard of conditions suited to widespread adoption for all other sectors of the Australian Working Community at an early date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sad for me to assert that the whole of that purpose is today being frustrated by an all too dilatory attitude on the part of our courts adopting a complex argumentation for the disposal of cases, adhering to technicality and expounding it as if research instead of the practical administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> were important, and then handicapped very seriously by an over-burden of excessive cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure contributes an important supplementary arm in the administrative field which greatly assists the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and which supplies it in great measure where the common law courts deny themselves the right to review administrative decisions on the merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear indication of the Opposition Parties is that they do not believe that a Superior Court is in the interests of the people of Australia or the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the view was expressed that the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not be frustrated by the withholding of public documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where there is a clash between the public interest in non-disclosure because of possible harm to the nation or the public service and the public interest in disclosure for the fair administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> then the court must balance the two conflicting interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree entirely with this approach but consider that statutory provision should be made to clarify the position so far as administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the public interest that harm shall not be done to the nation or the Public Service by disclosure of certain documents and there is the public interest that the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall not be frustrated by the withholding of documents that must be produced if <span class="highlight">justice</span> is to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had the spectacle again tonight of  Senator Greenwood  berating this Government for its efforts to ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the age pensioners of this country when his own Government allowed the age pension, widows’ pensions and so on to fall to their lowest percentage of average weekly earnings for 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was obviously necessary, as I think  Senator DrakeBrockman  would agree, that even to prepare the Bill and to engage in the sort of studies that were necessary after the report on the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares was produced, officers other than those who had been engaged in the traditional areas of repatriation would be needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did announce that the time for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to present his report had been extended to 3 1 March of this year, but apparently  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has been confronted with some difficulties which have prevented him from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot in all <span class="highlight">justice</span> say to those people that I can agree to the increase in the cost of this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If perhaps we reverse the situation and look at what he would receive if she died, there is no equity and there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the argument that this should remain at 62.5 per cent and not be increased to 67 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the current scheme was instituted following the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in 1966 it was believed that it would bring in a new era on the waterfront which would ease the dislocation which previously had occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legal profession can cling to the old shibboleths that it has about legal procedures, long and drawn out as they are, and say that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has to be done, then on the other side of the coin the waterside worker is entitled at times to be a bit wary during inclement weather about performing certain duties because it is his arm or his leg that is on the block. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward, to the Bastyn report and to other reports, and they indicate that there are unique circumstances in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was parading the waterfront everybody put up his hands and said: ‘Bring in weekly hiring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such persons, after relinquishing judicial office, provided that this has not been for misconduct, are entitled by Royal Warrant to be designated as ‘The Honourable’ and by custom, if not as a matter of law, are addressed as ‘<span class="highlight">Justice</span>’ or ‘Judge’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been many instances of such appointments in recent times and in addition to the large number of Royal Commissions several recent inquiries have been conducted by retired judges, namely the Barrier Reef inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wallace, the Western Australian inquiries into Aborigines by  His  Honour Judge Furnell and the inquiry into airlines by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sholl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that to be a wildly exaggerated claim and one which does not really do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the very fair and important role which this Government has played in promoting the Hope Commute report and this Bill which gives expression to the recommendations of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not in the short time tonight do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to what I think is an extremely fine report of the investigation of the Hope Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the magistrates and judges who preside in those courts have developed that specialist ability, the ordinary courts of the land are not lacking in the expertise necessary to enable them to adjudicate fairly and with <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the matters which come before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not heard it argued that they have been doing it in any way which denies <span class="highlight">justice</span> to litigants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Senator Sir Magnus Cormack invites me to move into an intriguing area but I am one who holds to the view that in the courts you find <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You do not find <span class="highlight">justice</span>, unless you are exceptionally fortunate, in the way that bureaucrats, officials or Ministers decide what the rights of people are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> depends upon having a system of courts, upon having a rule of law and upon having courts as the place in which the law is administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to see them extended into further areas than the areas in which they are used at present because I think that the existence of jury trials indentifies the people who are called on jury service with the way in which the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more people who are identified in that way with the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> the greater will be public satisfaction with our system of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Garfield  Barwick,  Mr Snedden,  the present  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen and  Mr Hughes  are all previous Attorneys-General who have interested themselves in and supported the concept of a Superior Court until they have seen what was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are looking for a system in which <span class="highlight">justice</span> is simply administered and readily available to people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country will be advanced by creating alongside the existing system of courts which have served us well over the years a completely new system which must be involved- in the creation of a Federal Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not merely dilatory; it is expensive and it is entirely subversive to the true administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, so much so that convictions won in the State court after being appealed through two or three courts can come up anew in a Federal court four and five years after the original conviction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it is a matter of some encouragement that a consciousness of that danger is growing, and I quoted to the Senate on the last occasion an utterance by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales warning us of the pitfalls of creating a dual judicature in Australia, one Federal and one State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody who knows the history of the drafting of the judicature section of our Constitution knows that it took place aboard the ‘Lucinda’ on the Brisbane River one weekend and Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Griffiths, who was chiefly responsible for it, paid too much attention to the American precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the churlish impertinence to think that he can get a group of judges who will man this court and be as obedient to him in administering <span class="highlight">justice</span> as the Cavanaghs, the Camerons and the Cairnses, but judges have an independence more durable than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you spell it c-o-r-t or c-a-u-g-h-t, or is it a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things are very serious, because the idea of a dualism in jurisdiction was commented upon by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon in the advice he gave to the royal commission in 1929. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However effectual such provisions may be for ensuring that the High Court retains an almost exclusive authority to declare the meaning and effect of the Constitution, no one can fail to see that this is done at the expense of rendering almost futile and impossible the practical administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the purpose of adjusting the real controversies between subject and subject, or redressing real grievances which a subject may have against the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly, they arise from the fact that jurisdiction has been conferred upon a court on certain very limited matters by reference to considerations or criteria which have no relation to the practical administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but to circumstances that arise or features which are exhibited only accidentally or incidentally in the ordinary administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and this has been done- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Federal jurisdiction’ forms a grave impediment to the practical administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think this confusion and all the difficulties which attend it ought to receive the serious attention of those interested in maintaining a Federal system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is speedy, efficient and practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this argumentation takes time, bedevilling the whole of the prospect of getting <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the litigant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are interested though in one system of judicature in which all judges are bound according to the common law conception of England to be obedient to the law whatever it is, whether it is Federal or State, and give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the litigants, administering the whole system of law then and there as inexpensively as possible and eradicating these needless jurisdictional disputes that are so barren and unproductive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will consist of a chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> and other judges appointed from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest single disadvantage of the proposed Superior Court is that constitutional questions of jurisdiction will necessarily loom large in the Court’s deliberations, resulting in considerable uncertainty and expense to litigants, unproductive use of the Court’s time, and consequent damage to the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the formulation which the Minister’s advisers have put before him and which he read to the House, but we will come back to that a little later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will simply use its numbers without concern for the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of what it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it would have done <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly),  from whom we have heard so often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, it is beyond dispute, as a recent article in the ‘Australian Law Journal’ declared, that a judge cannot take part in the decision of a matter in respect of which he has already appeared as counsel to argue one side of the case- a view which I think  Senator McClelland  might well remember that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy accepted when he declined to sit on the case in which it was argued whether or not the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill was a valid exercise of power by the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s reasoning was that because of his earlier association with the subject matter of the proceeding, he should not sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy in regard to the particular case which he raised, because more recently there was a case in which he did sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That of course was a matter upon which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy had given advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall an occasion in the Australian Industrial Court- the Commonwealth Industrial Court as it was known before that word was ostracisedwhen a challenge was made to the propriety of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy sitting in a matter involving the Australian Workers Union, the objection being based on the fact that a firm of lawyers with whom  His  Honour had been associated before he was elevated to the bench had acted for the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the matter to which I have adverted involving  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy arose during the life of the previous coalition Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should set the lead in seeing to it that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not only done but also appears to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His political career and beliefs are based on a deep-seated hatred of trade unions and he is longing to throw into reverse all that the ALP and the union movement have fought for over decades to achieve wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and decent job conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as Attorney-General, in or about June 1973, respond to an indication by the AttorneyGeneral of New South Wales to the effect that the State of New South Wales was prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth in respect of a National Companies Act and a Securities and Exchange Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as Attorney-General, state at the meeting of the Standing Committee of AttorneysGeneral held in Perth on 3 July 1973 that he would let the States know of the Commonwealth’s reaction to the proposals put forward by the Commonwealth and State officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as Attorney-General, also promise at the Standing Committee’s meeting on 3 July 1 973 to let the States have an outline of the type and scope of the powers which he felt would be necessary to enable the Commonwealth to legislate in a competent manner removed from any constitutional doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answers to (4) and (5) are in the affirmative, did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as Attorney-General, ever honour the undertakings he gave; if not, why were they not honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as Attorney-General, invite the views of the Attorneys-General of any, and, if so, of which States, on the subject matter of the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill before the Bill was introduced into the Senate in December 1974; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, these matters fall within the compass of the Inquiry by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With reference to the answer given by the previous Attorney-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, to the question asked by  Senator Greenwood  concerning the alleged intimidation by the Australian Builders Labourers Federation towards six building companies concerning their proceedings before the High Court: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from the judgment of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Burger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of  Lanyon Pty Ltd v. Commonwealth of Australia  the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menzies in the High Court of Australia upheld a claim of privilege in respect of documents falling within a certain class, namely:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another case here in the Australian Capital Territory, the case of  Kent  v.  Cavanagh-  the Black Mountain case-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory upheld a claim of privilege to certain documents falling within a certain class, namely: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were the honourable senator’s sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play he just has no sense of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may add one more word, with the greatest and deepest respect,  Mr President,  I think that this epitomises the problems that a lay person and a person who is not qualified in the law faces when he is in a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> without the representation that is there provided to him in the form of counsel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, however, documents do not fall within classes such as these, it is open to the court to decline to be bound by the Minister’s certificate and consider the documents themselves to see whether the withholding of them is necessary in the public interest having in mind the public interest of ensuring the proper administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think they raise matters which warrant the attention of persons concerned with <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the industrial movement and with seeing that right is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to be discourteous to a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, nor do I want to be discourteous to somebody I served under. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the view was expressed that the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> should not be frustrated by the withholding of public documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where there is a clash between the public interest in nondisclosure because of possible harm to the nation or to the Public Service and the public interest in disclosure for the fair administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> then the court must balance the two conflicting interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In her work in the community at large, Dame Ivy was a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace and a Special Magistrate in the Children’s Court of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it continued when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose was appointed by the previous Government to inquire into the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter which is still pending is the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have told both the RSL and the Australian Services Council that they will have a copy of that report for at least 6 months so that they can make recommendations on it before any action would be considered by the Government in line with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after that the previous Government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to make his inquiry into the repatriation system and this seemed to cause some additional concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal inquiry into repatriation is that which is being undertaken and has been undertaken for the past years by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose ‘s report, which I hope to receive within the next couple of months, I will make it available to all of the veterans organisations and they will have at least 6 months to consider  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose ‘s recommendations and to advise the Government of their views on those recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Opposition pose as though they have a boundless faith in the efficiency and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the free enterprise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, the  Chairman  of the Tribunal, and the members of it are to be congratulated on their practical and effective approach to the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister discussed such requests with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is that social <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, when I came back from Tasmania I contacted the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, and asked him to make available the services of a commissioner, Commissioner Judith Cohen, who has been closely associated with the dispute, in a further attempt to find a solution to the dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet, because  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  is so stubborn, so bigoted and by nature so unjust, another appointment will be made this afternoon quite contrary to all the accepted principles- political principles and principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a tragedy, a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that many of the people directly responsible for some of these business failures will pay no penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that in the days when  Mr Snedden  was the Leader of the Opposition he made an appeal to the Premier of New South Wales,  Mr Lewis,  not to appoint any person other than a member of the Labor Party to the vacancy caused by the resignation of  Senator, now Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against the background that many of us have laboured for years to get citizenship <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people who have been given rather vague evaluations by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I ask  Senator James  McClelland: Can the Senate have an assurance that the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on national security operations, an objective to which many people, including myself, have contributed, will not be ignored in the fact of the appointment of a new and overdue ASIO chieftain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The appointment of a new head of ASIO is not to be taken as implying that the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, following his investigation of that body, will be regarded by the Government as redundant or superfluous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is one of the most distinguished lawyers in this country and, as anybody would know who has read any of his previous reports following inquiries in which he has participated, such as the inquiry into the national estate, the Government is entitled to expect from this distinguished lawyer reflections and findings on the nature of ASIO operations which are sure to be most helpful and which are designed to improve the quality of that organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say in passing that I know  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward personally, that I have the highest regard for him and that I believe he will make an excellent ASIO chief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the AttorneyGeneral, refers to the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Has  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made any report to the Government in regard to his inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has not yet reported to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to who is acting as the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation at the present time, I am not quite sure whether  Mr Barbour’s  proposed successor,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, has yet assumed office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be remembered that among the recommendations that were made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares for the financing of the scheme there was the recommendation or the suggestion that the imposition of a levy on the price of petrol to replace the present compulsory third party insurance premiums should be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the claims of the Government about morality and electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> and reform the fact that at the end of 2 years there is still a seat in Western Australia which is in excess of 10 per cent below the variation which the Government believes to be proper and just I think points up the phoneyness of the whole operation of the proposed electoral redistribution which we are now considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the third time we rise to talk about achieving some sort of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if that is the situation- indeed it is- then it is virtually impossible to get a system which is closer to electoral fairness and real <span class="highlight">justice</span> than is exhibited by the results of those elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a very great concern indeed about electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am emphasising these points because I believe that they are significant; they are absolutely indicative of the fact that the redistribution which is before us is not really concerned with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the total Australian scene and certainly not with <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the total scene as we see it in the State of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are totally unnecessary in that the evidence of the elections that have been held in the last 3 years indicates that there is a remarkable <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the results that come from the electoral set-up that exists in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This takes the matter of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> out of the hands of the personal or party ambitions of politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They establish a form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which  Senator Jessop  does not like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he says that the general average in Australia is the proper result, whether an electorate in Sydney has twice the number of electors as a country electorate in Queensland, he absolutely denies the individual’s right to <span class="highlight">justice</span> in whether he or she personally has an equal say in one part of Australia when compared with an electorate in another part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this cant and humbug about <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair representation should be seen for what it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, they opted for a marginal short-term political advantage and for mockery of electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that by implication,  Senator Greenwood  is denigrating the new Director-General of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward whom I understood was acceptable to the Opposition as a suitable person for that particular position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, even conceding that there may have been miscarriages of <span class="highlight">justice</span>,  Senator Georges  will agree with me that we could substitute cases involving Spanish and Greek nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an indication of the rough <span class="highlight">justice</span> I apply but, it is <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British, when they were responsible for maintenance of law and order and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in large parts of the world in the 18th and certainly 19th century, would never allow a British citizen to be treated in the way in which Australian citizens are treated in various parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General a question concerning  Senator Greenwood’s  assertion that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy had been guilty of disgraceful conduct in connection with the High Court’s decision on Senate representation for the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The first 5 justices of the High Court of Australia were all former politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Griffith, Justices Barton, O’Connor, Isaacs and Higgins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All but  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Griffith were members of the first Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Justices Evatt, McTiernan, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Latham, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy were also members of the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the present High Court, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy were AttorneysGeneral of Australia and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mason was Solicitor-General of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that each of them and the other justices before them were appointed to the Court, acted for numerous persons and bodies and gave advice on aspects of the Constitution and the laws which are constantly coming before the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that many years ago- in 1922, as a matter of fact- 2 justices of the High Court, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Knox and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke, sat to determine the constitutionality issue in the actual case in which they had previously appeared as counsel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the famous constitutional case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Marshall presided over the United States Supreme Court and ruled on the validity of events in which he had participated as Secretary of State <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absurd to suggest that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy should not rule on whether, apart from the method of its passing, the Act was constitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outburst by  Senator Greenwood  is explained by his notorious paranoia in all matters concerning  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the attack by  Senator Greenwood  on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy another breach of convention in that it has always been the rule in this Senate that no senator should criticise the Crown or the judiciary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in addition to the way I categorised it earlier, which aroused the ire of  Sir Magnus  Cormack, I would say that this action and all such actions of  Senator Greenwood  are based primarily on jealousy of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s great achievements as a legislator in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked my Department as soon as possible to get the whole transcript of the evidence presented to see whether there was any travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the method of presentation of the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it ought to be recalled, in the light of what he said, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy had declined to sit upon the first constitutional case which the High Court heard after his appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Petroleum and Minerals Authority case the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> told the court before the hearing began that he had agreed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy’s request not to participate in the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is usual for the Bench on hearing a constitutional case to be composed of all Justices available to participate in the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy has indicated to me that because of his earlier association with the subject matter of the proceedings we are about to hear, he does not regard himself as available to participate in the hearing and decision of this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That initial attitude which was expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy was not carried through to subsequent cases of constitutional import on which he has sat, one alone of which has so far reached the point of judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s reference to  Sir Adrian  Knox and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke I think completely misrepresents the actual statement which those judges made in which they explained why, having regard to a provision that there should be at least 3 justices concurring in any constitutional case, they had to sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I desired to say by way of personal explanation was that the imputations of the Minister were ill-founded, that there was a very solid and basic ground for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy not sitting, and he should not have sat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that  Senator Greenwood  has sought in vain to distinguish the case of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy from that of other distinguished judges whom 1 cited in my reply to the question I was asked earlier and who saw no conflict, no breach of judicial duty, in having advised governments and then having sat as judges in interpreting cases based on Acts on which they had advised governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case which  Senator Greenwood  has cited of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy requesting the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> that he should not sit on one of the earlier cases that came before the High Court concerning the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, I suggest, is very persuasive evidence of the seriousness with which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy approaches his duties and the etiquette of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that  Senator Greenwood  cites it is, I think, some refutation of the attitude which he has taken towards  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Greenwood  has chosen to refer to the case which I cited that of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Knox and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke, sitting in a case in which they had actually been counsel I think I should set at rest any doubts that the Senate might entertain as to what sort of precedent is established by this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Yes, and I should like to quote a section from the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested by  Senator Greenwood  that it is outrageous for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy to sit on a court in which a matter is before that court concerning an Act on which he may have advised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>31,CommonwealthLaw Reports, page 42 1, and the passage I cite appears at page 456, where  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Knox-  and I, when at the Bar, had been counsel for opposite parties in this litigation, and would, in the ordinary course, have taken no part in the decision of this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide: ‘A Full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless at least three Justices concur in the decision’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and I thought that we could not, with due regard to our duty, decline the responsibility of adjudicating upon such questions if they actually called for decision, but we made it clear that we should take no further part in the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-But they adjudicated on the constitutional aspects, which is exactly what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy has been doing in this case, and I think that the tortuous casuistic attempts which  Senator Greenwood  has made to justify his original totally unjustified slur of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy simply will not hold water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  has the same rank, status and precedence as a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only since that time- as a result of  Senator Townley  becoming a member of the official Opposition after he had been elected as an Independent, as a result of  Senator Murphy  retiring from this place to become a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, and as a result of the death of  Senator Milliner  from Queenslandthat the Senate is now in its present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland knows as well as I do that when the present <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, was  Senator Murphy  and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, he accepted the responsibility as Leader of the Opposition to slow down the processes of government in the House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If further proof was needed on the matter, one need only to look at the opinions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy, then  Senator Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18 June 1970,  Senator Murphy- Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy now- said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that while the findings of the Commission remain unchallenged and while  Mr Connor  stands disclosed by his own conduct as a man who either lied to the Parliament or who engaged in such a pattern of misrepresentation and concealment that it amounts to the same thing, there is a need for <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first quick review was concerned primarily with comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> for academics and the Tribunal, under  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, foreshadowed then that it would proceed to a more comprehensive and in depth review at a later stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell and the members of the Tribunal are currently undertaking an extensive program of visits to and discussions with institutions of tertiary education throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former Attorney-General has blackguarded the High Court and one of its members,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has never blackguarded the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, a former Attorney-General, who was a member of one of the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know that on 26 September the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  announced that the Government had decided to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward, O.B.E., to be the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In announcing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s appointment, the Prime Minister said that it is appropriate that this very important position should be filled by a judge and that in the Government’s view this position should in future always be filled by a person holding judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I remind honourable senators that while he was a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Owen  Dixon, who later became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, was appointed Australian Minister to the United States in 1942 and the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1942 was passed to enable him to hold that office in addition to his judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward now receives such additional remuneration by virtue of his office as  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow the Court to operate at its full strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s appointment with ASIO, which is for 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was elected as an independent senator to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter that I am discussing is the scurrilous conduct of honourable senators from Tasmania who do not heed the appeal of their Premier to do some <span class="highlight">justice</span> and save their State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of the Prices Justification Tribunal,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, has drawn the attention of my Department to that report, and I am given to understand by him that in view of recent movements in bread prices the Tribunal considered that the application made to it by the 2 major Victoria based companies should be looked at in some depth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not inconsistent with fundamental rights and duties, the House should avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum or body of inquiry or permit its proceedings to interfere in the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from particular matters, such as criminal cases, courts martial, civil cases and matters referred by a legislature to a judicial body, the rule has application to other hearings, inquiries or investigations in which the rights of individuals or community groups or the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the flimsy excuses which  Mr Souter  put forward to explain the second deal and which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins dismissed as fantastic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the concept of <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the former first law officer of the Crown in this Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Does it trouble him as a matter of elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> that all the sworn testamentary and documentary evidence which was presented to the Royal Commission on Petroleum and which could have exonerated  Mr Souter  and the Australian Council of Trade Unions of the charge of deliberate deceit of the Government was entirely overlooked by the royal commission in its report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins has had a long and distinguished career both at the Bar and as a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins’ long career at the Bar and his experience over 20 years as a prominent jurist, I say it is scandalous that the findings of the commission on the evidence which was presented to it are brought into query by members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now invite the Opposition if it has any evidence to present to  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins to go to the royal commission which resumed its sittings today and present such evidence to the royal commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He recommended to the presiding judge,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, that the application to reopen be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After  Mr Woodhouse  had tendered his affidavit or had his affidavit read at the commission and after hearing submissions by counsel,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins stated that he would consider the matter of  Mr Woodhouse  ‘s application to have the hearing reopened and advise his decision this week, probably on Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is the ability in this place to pursue the cause of individuals who are denied what is common <span class="highlight">justice</span>, there will always be people in this chamber, I hope, who will take up the cudgels on behalf of such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Director is to be  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward who will take office, according to announcements made, at the end of November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is and has been a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court since 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, what the Bill does is to ensure that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s, position as a judge, although he is not named personally in the Bill, is preserved notwithstanding that he holds the office of Director of the Organization. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly wish  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward every satisfaction in the discharge of his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the present director of the Organisation has ceased to perform the functions of directorgeneral and that the new appointee,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, is not to take office until some time towards the end of November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, I told  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope at my in camera interview with him that I believed in the Canadian system of reviewing citizenship rejections whereby in a 9-man panel any five members constitute an appeals board, one-third of the members are legal people and another third are a blending of representatives of trade unions, manufacturers and other kindred groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not speaking out of school in saying that in a conversation I had with our illustrious Prime Minister I asked whether  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse ‘s appointment would mean that he would be deaf to any reforms that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope may suggest and he told me emphatically no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt),  knows that if any further adjustments have to be made to ASIO after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has brought down his report, which I think will be a monumental one, I will be the first one to raise those matters in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward will not take up his duties as director until he has completed some judicial duties on which he is currently engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government extended the terms of reference to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to inquire into in order to delay his report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must confess that I am a little distressed to find that a journal such as the Adelaide  Sunday-Mail  has alleged that somehow or other I am prolonging the inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose and delaying its conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite true that the inquiry was established in October 1971 by the previous Government and that upon Labor being elected in December 1972 the time was extended for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to complete his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hunter  says that secretly I have been giving additional terms of reference for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to inquire into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators that I have not been giving  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose anything to inquire into at all other than what was given to him by the previous Government, and 4 years - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that the time taken for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose ‘s inquiry and the preparation of the report has now lasted almost as long as the First World War did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am afraid there is nothing more that I can do about the matter other than to wait for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose to present his report, which we have now been awaiting so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to the proceedings of Estimates Committee F at which I asked for further information on an innovation suggested to the Government via  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson for the printing of many awards in foreign languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate at that time, the former  Senator Murphy-  he is now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, having been elevated to the High Court because of his knowledge of these things- in a statement which he made in the Senate in 1970 said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned, the position is endorsed by  Mr Whitlam  and even by  Senator Murphy,  now a <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, promoted by the Labor Party to the High Court because of his competence in such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Khemlani  is here to try to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for himself in respect of the work he had done in attempting to raise loans for the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still fifteen of them sitting on the Government benches who were here in 1972 and who voted with the former  Senator Murphy,  now a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, when he moved that motion and when he said those words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard many quotations of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and also ex-Senator Murphy, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  credibility is not questioned by this Government because it saw fit to elevate the then  Senator Murphy  to the High Court where he is now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quoting the words of  Senator Lionel  Murphy, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now invite the Opposition if it has any evidence to present to  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then  Senator Murphy,  who is now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, also sent a reference to the IAC when it was his responsibility with regard to the situation in the tomato industry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I indicated that, after the affidavit of  Mr Woodhouse  had been presented to the Royal Commission on Petroleum,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins had stated that he would consider the matter of  Mr Woodhouse  ‘s application to have the hearing reopened and advise his decision this week, probably today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following is forwarded to you for submission to  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins then said that he had caused inquiries to be made and  Senator Greenwood  would be available at 2 p.m. on Monday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins said that in the meantime he would make no findings on the application by  Mr Woodhouse  to reopen the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Family Law Bill- a monument to the former Attorney-General, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy- has completely refurbished the marriage and divorce laws of Australia and done away with the medieval concepts of guilt and fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  and the then  Senator Murphy,  now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, advocated the throwing out of a Liberal-Country Party Budget, and in fact pursued that course by voting against the Budget in the House of Representatives and by voting against the same measure in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remember also that something like 84 per cent of the people who had never heard of our proposal for legal aid said, when the proposal was put to them, that if there was one thing that was needed to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the ordinary people of Australia it was the Legal Aid Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am pleased also to be able to quote the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen in the recent action in the High Court relating to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority where, referring to the Senate,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs in the same case said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under its new  chairman- Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rae ElseMitchellthe Commission is continuing to bring to bear the same expertise and sympathetic understanding to the problem of reducing the inequalities which abound in local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that a royal commission in 1967 and 1968, I think under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else.Mitchell, made recommendations to the New South Wales Government with regard to the principle of grants to the States and a Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Chaney  quotes 2 Justices of the High Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs, as upholding the power of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have the authority of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four Justices of the High Court unequivocally stated that the Senate’s powers were not being misused and that the Senate did have the power to reject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, in view of his past record, would support that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That makes 5 justices of the High Court who would support that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon what basis or principle of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is his account to be denied? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, presented an interim report which dealt with payments and demands by maritime unions on foreign vessels entering into the Australian coastal trade under permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney indicated that the Royal Commission would go on to examine demands and payments in respect of certain work claimed to be that of shore labour being performed by ships’ crews. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the previous Government acknowledged, there has been a necessity for some reassessment of the whole repatriation system which was why  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose was appointed some years ago to inquire into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt in due course we will hear what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose suggests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Woodhouse Committee of Inquiry, which was appointed after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose was appointed, has brought down its report; the report has been debated; a Bill has been presented to the Parliament; the Senate committee of inquiry has been held; and another Bill is being prepared for presentation to the Parliament, I dare say  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has been able to find time to look at the possible impact which a national compensation scheme would have on the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that if there were to be some additional benefit given to veterans who are totally and permanently incapacitated this would involve some amendments to the Repatriation Act rather than any provision being made within the national compensation scheme itself and that is why it is important that we learn as quickly as possible what proposals  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with political views and backgrounds as far apart and as totally divorced as  Sir Robert  Menzies,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy and, indeed,  Mr Whitlam  have indicated that they believe that the powers of assent and veto of the Senate are the same as those powers in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy,  Sir Robert  Menzies and  Mr Whitlam,  we have the view of Quick and Garran, the interpreters of the Constitution, the view of  Mr Odgers  in his book  Australian Senate Practice,  and the views of a number of professors of law, of prominent Queen’s counsel and of many other people interested in the constitutional circumstances of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was about to cite the circumstances of the elevation of  Senator Murphy  to the High Court as a <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been the subject of inquiry by a royal commission headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins and I understand that since  Senator Greenwood  last referred to this matter he has made submissions to that commission in Adelaide- I think it was on Monday- seeking to have certain aspects of the hearing in respect to the specifics of the ACTU-Solo matter reopened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins has reserved his decision on that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the first point- the point that the fathers of our Constitution wished to create a Senate far more powerful than any other second House- I would simply refer to a statement by the Right Honourable  Sir Edmund  Barton, the Leader of the Australasian Federal Convention 1897-98, the first Prime Minister and a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is the way in which to give him <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is common <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore one can see that the system which the Treasurer proposes is a great advance and gives greater equity and greater <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the taxpayer than the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat to the Senate the brief quotations from the judgments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs in the litigation with respect to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephens said, in referring to the Senate: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gibbs in the same case said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from appointing  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey to conduct an inquiry into taxation in the dying days of the McMahon Government and making one minor amendment to the income tax laws in 1954, I think it can be said in a rather general way that the previous Government made no substantial change or alteration in the tax system between 1949 and 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is scant <span class="highlight">justice</span> for- pensioners in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon I wish to quote from a memorandum of  Sir Samuel  Griffith who rose to be the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he was the first Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Commonwealth, one of the greatest Australians; . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That person who had so much to do with the formation of the Constitution just before he resigned set out his views clearly as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in a memorandum which I have read to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody of any experience whatever, except an infant, would know that Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Griffith was a most outstanding Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who pioneered the High Court to its elevated position from which it went on and on to gain prestige in the juridical circles of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Griffith, as  Senator Steele  Hall said, was the chief architect of the Commonwealth Constitution, ably assisted by  Sir Edmund  Barton and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Andrew Inglis Clark of Tasmania, those 3 persons being the chief draftsmen of the first draft of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be noticed that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is not on record here as interpreting section 53 as denying to the Senate the constitutional right to reject a money Bill, whether it be one which is amendable or one which is not amendable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be noticed also that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> refers with very grea t care to the working rule in a practical way that has for the present been adopted, no doubt with a full knowledge that  Sir Robert  Garran, writing in his text both before and after the Constitution, referred to the rule that on confidence in the House of Representatives, then referred to as the popular House, under the theory of responsible government, depended the life of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 1 November 1975, without any consultation whatever from the Governor-General or the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia or  Mr Ellicott  or other people associated with the events - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that before 1 1 November the Governor-General had called for the legal opinion of a member of the legal fraternity who was also a member of the then Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  the present Attorney-General, who is a cousin of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly during the weekend preceding Tuesday, 1 1 November, there had been discussions with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the undisputed evidence indicates that discussions were held by the Governor-General with people who were not his political advisers; that the Governor-General called for the legal opinion of a prominent member of the legal fraternity who at that time was a member of the Opposition and who happened to be a cousin of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court; that the Governor-General sought the legal opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court; that the Governor-General did not seek the advice of, or even have discussions on the subject with, the Prime Minister or any of his other Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Government trying to deny the work force of this country the principle of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> by urging the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to award in its wage indexation hearing half the rise in the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their then leader in this place, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, supported the unlimited powers of the Senate to defeat money Bills and referred to 168 occasions I think it was since 1952 when the Opposition had attempted to defeat money Bills and to 4 occasions when the Opposition had succeeded in defeating money Bills including Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to try to develop the point that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to all the Queensland senators that we will get even with them on that point one day and it will be <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question that arises is: Is there any solution to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our society through political action - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In speaking to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of the Governor-General I wish, firstly, not just to pay a formal tribute to the newly-elected  President  but also to say how much I warmly regard his elevation to the office which he now holds and how, during the short period in which I have been a member of this Parliament, I have come to appreciate the unique qualities that he possesses and his sense of fairness and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I greatly appreciate many of the things that he has done in this Parliament and many of his abilities, but I believe that he did himself much less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> last evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a combination of a Prime Minister who was of their own ilk, a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who was always a political operator and a compliant GovernorGeneral; and the aim was achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Moore and the other justices of the Arbitration Court were not amused or impressed by the arguments of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also indicated -this is the point I emphasise- that no final decisions will be made by the Government until we have received the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox who is conducting the environmental inquiry into the proposed Ranger leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government’s decision also involves issues of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and political integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing  Senator Laucke  as I do, I feel perfectly confident that he will discharge the duties of his office with dignity and with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vice Regal notes, which are of course a relic of the old days, in the  Canberra Times  of 11 November 1975 stated: ‘The GovernorGeneral,  Sir John  Kerr, received the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, at Admiralty House yesterday morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> spent several hours with the Governor-General the day before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister no doubt will be aware that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead has again drawn attention to the inadequacy of the Fannie Bay gaol, calling it the worst institution of its type in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead is a distinguished jurist with wide experience and his statement on the facilities at Fannie Bay gaol must be treated with respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we not entitled to ask: Did  Sir Garfield  Barwick as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> carry out those canons, those standards, when he spoke unofficially, with no authority and without the knowledge of the Minister, the MinistersinCouncil, the Prime Minister and those of the Executive Council, when he was not entitled to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should not have sought the advice of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth remembering, honourable senators, that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> holds no particular position in the High Court other than as the administrative head who allocates responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has no substance greater than that of any other member of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I am led to believe that a majority of the members of the High Court does not agree with the sort of advice which, it is said, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> proffered to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until very recently, women in our society, through a variety of formal barriers, traditional prejudice, and sheer neglect by policy makers, were denied equal access with men to education, health care, job training, employment, wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>- in all, to the possibility of real independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The injustice to women implicit in the concept of the male breadwinner, which was first applied by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Higgins in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in 1907, has finally been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Whitlam Government women were given access to wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a number of steps remain before wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> becomes a reality for all working women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late last year a request was made for assistance to present a submission to the inquiry being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These Bills were introduced following the announcement of the decision to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward, O.B.E. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar provision was contained in the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1942 which provided for the appointment of  Sir Owen  Dixon, then a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia, to be Australian Minister to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward now receives such additional remuneration by virtue of his office as  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow the court to operate if necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s appointment with ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not alone in trying to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people who are crying out for assistance and guidance on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, for one, will continue to press in every way that I can and in any way that I can for some assistance for these people and to see that the Aboriginal people of Aurukun at least are given <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their claims in relation to this mining venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Bills are to permit  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to become the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward may take up his new position as Director-General of ASIO, it is necessary also to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely because of this sort of factor that the Opposition looks forward to the publication of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in relation to ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow the Court to operate if necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s appointment with ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it must endeavour to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> according to law as between the immediate parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court there sees- in its own judgment- a dichotomy between doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> and what it calls getting to the heart of the matter by abandoning to some degree the normal rules of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we are dealing only with the appointment of a new Director to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, what I want to illustrate very simply is how a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> almost occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to ASIO will be an appointment from the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the role of the custodian of civil liberties and the dangers inherent in that role, I seek an assurance from the Minister, as I sought from my own Government, that when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope presents his report on his long standing inquiry into security matters the Government will not say: ‘Look,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has taken over as the Director of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to believe and hope- and no pun is intended- that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations will provide opportunity for a number of innovations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply hammering the theme that I look forward to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope as being one proposing reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without being at all egotistical, I should point out that I had the good fortune to spend over an hour with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The track record of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is excellent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister will give me an assurance that whatever  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommends will be receptive to the Government and to the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has to be appointed DirectorGeneral of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should say what it means which is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward should receive the salary he is now receiving, namely, the salary which applies to the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward to ASIO and that another judge is likely to come back full time to the work of the Industrial Court and be able to fill his place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  P. G. Evatt who was appointed on 2 July 1974 with very little industrial experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  R. J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now proposed to increase the number of judges, other than the Chief Judge, from nine to ten to cover the transfer (but not the retirement) of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to the position of Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward will retain his judicial status during his occupancy of the position of Director-General of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Australian Capital Territory they include  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory, they are  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, let us take  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that we are expected to approve of an increase in the establishment of the Industrial Court to fill the vacancy which will be created by the departure of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long has  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward spent in the work of the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has been inquiring into Aboriginal conditions, from which emerged the Woodward report on that subject, and into the pay and conditions of the armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Eggleston resigned on 30 June 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney has made inquiries into indemnity payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, Q.C., was a senior counsel engaged in diverse industrial cases as well as in a number of other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other 2 appointments,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  St John were in fact virtually unknown in the Federal industrial arena and were not greatly known in the State industrial arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief Judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer, was appointed in 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy was appointed in 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske was appointed in 1960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers was appointed in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo was appointed in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, whom the Government is now transferring to other spheres, was appointed in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki was appointed in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That document mentions that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo was seconded to the position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, on the basis that his Norfolk Island assignment was supposed to be completed by the end of last year, he should be available for Industrial Court work in 1 976, thus providing an effective replacement for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward to the DirectorGeneralship of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that last year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward spent 28 days sitting on the Australian Industrial Court Bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo will be able to take up that slack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the past 1 8 months  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo has been virtually full-time on the Norfolk Island inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, as honourable senators would know, has been engaged on the maritime inquiry concerning indemnity payments and prior to that on the  Moore v. Doyle  inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief Judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy have conducted maritime collision inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, as  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal, has been engaged on trade practices matters which, in addition to becoming more numerous, are by their very nature lengthy in their hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki is dealing with matters relating to copyright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The departure of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward virtually coincides with the return of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, whose Norfolk Island inquiry, was expected to finish at the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all the judges excluding  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward were available all the time for Industrial Court matters, there would be sufficient judges to cope with such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward with another judge would simply perpetuate the present unsatisfactory situation which has grown in recent years, whereby judges of the Industrial Court are available for Industrial Court matters only if they are not engaged on non-industrial matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the inquiry being conducted into Aboriginal rights by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward; the inquiry into Norfolk Island by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo; and the maritime inquiry into indemnity payments by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, who was, according to the Parliamentary Library, also the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time now, with the expected departure of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, to take stock of the position to ensure that suitable Industrial Court judges are engaged full time in the work of the Industrial Court so that it carries on as a judicial body should carry on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow the court to operate if necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s appointment with ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was here in 1956 when the Australian Industrial Court was created as a product of the Boilermakers decision that demanded a judicial court to decide those issues of a judicial character distinct from those of an arbitral character in the industrial field- which Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Dixon and the Privy Council had then established as a cardinal principle of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Federal sphere of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amorphous creation of 1956 has grown like Topsy, according to the convenience of age and disposition, the appointment of particular persons and the making of assignments, until now we have a court consisting of one chief judge and 10 justices to perform the work the statistical details of which  Senator Harradine  has laid before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite who do not really give consideration to the imperative qualities of the courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our system do not understand what dedication is required from the judges every day of the year to administer, according to law, the laws according to conscience and independent judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have in the Federal sphere, I think, an imperative requirement to demand that judges have regard to their ages, confine themselves to the jurisdiction and occupy themselves only injudicial work, especially where the industrial issues demand a greater perception of <span class="highlight">justice</span> than in any other field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Industrial Court should not squander its talents in other fields, however serviceable the justices may be in other fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is imperative, if we are to maintain a judiciary that serves the people, not divided federally, on the one hand, and according to States, on the other hand, that the people should have absolute confidence that according to the law they will receive <span class="highlight">justice</span> expeditiously, economically and promptly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are compromised by the fact that an important ASIO appointment was promised to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward some four or five months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that, having regard to the complexities of the modern industrial arbitration system and the hundreds of awards, to which these judges give attention from time to time and the demands which governments make upon the time and the energy of the judges in that jurisdiction, we would have given more thought and time to the factors which were in the mind of the previous Government when we sought to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to this important position of Director-General of out Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is how we of the Opposition see, and how we as a Government last year when the suggestion was made saw, the suggested appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to this very sensitive post of Director-General of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one is entitled to say that in the intervening years from 1 949 when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reid was appointed to this office, appointments were made which permitted the Organisation to go in directions that were not in the best interests of either the community or of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know something of what prompted  Mr Whitlam  to take the steps that he did last year in making the proposal to appoint a person of the calibre of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to the position of Director-General of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We trust- certainly this was in the mind of  Mr Whitlam  when he brought forward legislation similar to this in 1975- that the appointment of a member of the judiciary, in this case  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, will take us back to the 1 949 concept and that we will get out of the area where spies, counter spies, spooks and other similar people are involved in these activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our hope is that in the years that lie ahead people like  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward will take this Organisation back to its legitimate role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful, as indeed is the Opposition, that in the person of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward- a trained lawyer and a man in whom we have confidencethis type of approach will become much more dominant in the activities of ASIO, as distinct from the sort of behaviour pattern which became commonplace over the last 20 years in that Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the former Labor Government is to be commended for setting up the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security to inquire into ASIO and for initiating this Bill which will lead to the appointment of  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, as Director-General of the security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I consider the appointment of a judge of the status of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to be an extremely important step towards establishing a security service which has the respect and support of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the standing of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and the position of judges in Australia it will be a step towards re-establishing credibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as the Director-General of ASIO will certainly improve the standing of the service in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- The Senate has been debating cognately a Bill which will facilitate the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and a Bill which will enable the appointment of an additional judge to the Australian Industrial Court to overcome the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward will not be available to that court and, not unnaturally, each Bill has raised its own particular questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the fortunate results of this debate has been the universal applause which has been given to the intention to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as the Director-General of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was, of course, nominated by the outgoing Government and his appointment was supported by the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to see that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward still receives the support of the new Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to be unduly provocative, but we should not underestimate the task that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has ahead of him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has confidence in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The explanation is that the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal- that is a position which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has occupied- is similarly remunerated in a provision in the trade practices legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 33 of the Trade Practices Act states that the  President  shall, if he is not the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Court, the Chief Judge of the Australian Industrial Court or the  President  of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, be paid additional remuneration at the rate of $2,200 per annum and an additional annual allowance at the rate of $500 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine also suggested, and he was supported by  Senator Wright,  that the judges of the Industrial Court could well perform the tasks which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is now vacating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge some validity in so much of what  Senator Harradine  has said, but the basic concern which the Government had in introducing this amendment to the conciliation and arbitration legislation was to ensure that there was a judge of experience, of competence and of adequate background, to take on the task of presidency of the Trade Practices Tribunal, which was the particular work upon which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has been concentrating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director-General to be appointed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, is currently the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have spoken of the court in a collective sense in some of my earlier remarks I desire to say that to the extent to which the Australian Industrial Court still enjoys the confidence of the trade union movement is in no small measure due to the integrity and application of such jurists as the Chief Judge,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Spicer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dunphy,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, who of course is what this Bill is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of discussions that successive governments have had with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the Bill contains the provisions which are currently under debate to cover both aspects to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is in .receipt of a salary of $36,000 per annum, which is made up of a basic salary of $35,000, which every judge of the Industrial Court receives, and the sum of $ 1 ,000, which is payable to him in his capacity as  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward were the only person concerned, I could imagine that this would be a feasible way of approaching the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward because he knows who the appointee is to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward joins the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation the Government will raid the Industrial Court to find a replacement  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward at present is not doing work for the Australian Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is concerned about, of course, is a replacement for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as  President  of the Trade Practices <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious fact is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal and a member of the Industrial Court, and while he is head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation he cannot perform those functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have regard for the environment were encouraged by the assurance given in the other place that mining would not proceed until after  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox had completed his investigations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to remember that this is the document which the Governor-General handed to the Prime Minister at that time on 1 1 November-  for my own part, what I must do if  Mr Whitlam  persisted in his stated intentions I consulted the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes and let us examine the processes because any inattention to that does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parliamentary institution which we uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have now written to the  Chairman  of the Tribunal,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  W. B. Campbell, formally requesting him to make determinations on certain entitlements for members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the law advisers’ advice to which I have referred, the Governor-General sought the advice of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1914 the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> had been consulted by the GovernorGeneral of the day on the question of dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preserving the proper responsibilities of the office, what better and what more reliable advice could the Governor-General seek and get than from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> made a statement, part of which I seek to incorporate in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our conversations I indicated that I considered myself, as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia, free, on your Excellency’s request, to offer you legal advice as to Your Excellency’s constitutional rights and duties in relation to an existing situation which, of its nature, was unlikely to come before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, to summarise the position, made it quite clear that in a federal constitution the refusal of this chamber to join in the grant of appropriation could not be ignored and the Executive could not legally carry on government without parliamentary appropriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He acted without consulting his own law officers but after secret consultation with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, who may well have to adjudicate at some future time on the validity of his actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General was advised by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on this point as follows: ‘First, the Senate has constitutional power to refuse to pass a money Bill: it has power to refuse supply to the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General acted ‘after secret consultation with the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> prefaced his advice to the Governor-General with the opinion that the situation ‘of its nature ‘ was unlikely to come before the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Attorney-General correct a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if it has occurred; and, if so, how? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable senators would acknowledge that, where charges are laid, persons are brought before the courts and the processes of the courts result in those persons not being committed for trial, or their being acquitted, we should applaud our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and recognise in those circumstances that <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have you,  Mr President,  seen reports of a book written by  Mr Lloyd  and  Mr Clark  entitled Kerr’s King Hit which contains allegations that the Governor-General approached and obtained advice from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the New South <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wales Supreme Court, and reports of a categorical denial of such allegations by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Laurence  Street? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It asked how the police could obtain confessions from Aboriginal people under our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> when in fact those Aborigines could not make the confessions despite the fact that they had signed them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I asked myself: How is the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> working when this can happen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that he would have the intestinal fortitude to say them outside the parliament or in some place where I could act in the way that Aborigines acted and meted out <span class="highlight">justice</span> prior to 1 788. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that is an example of the organisation that is going on it is not hard to believe that the Government has set out on a concerted effort to deprive the people of their rights, of the grants to which they are entitled and of the ordinary <span class="highlight">justice</span> that all of us in this community expect and accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This recommendation to go through the Northern Land Council to the Prime Minister that the Aboriginal Law and order must not change, our scale of system to remain; what  Mr Whitlam  and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward gave us during the term of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We the members of the National Congress of the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islanders, assembled at Canberra, Australia this 10th day of March 1 976, do hereby, as the democratically elected representatives of our people, solemnly and unanimously resolve that we claim for our people the following inalienable rights:- the right to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the right to self determination as a separate and distinct people, with our own laws and customs, languages culture and heritage, living in our ancient home-land and with the right to a full voice in and influence on our own affairs, the right to be free from the racial oppression and discrimination imposed upon us by the uninvited European people who have invaded our country and imposed their own laws and way of life upon us, the right to preserve in perpetuity for our people the surviving tribal lands reserves and sacred sites in all Australian states and territories, the right to fair and just compensation to our scattered tribes, our detribalised and urban people, for the lands seized from our forefathers, and for the inhuman and violent treatment of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a system of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> to charge  an  organisation or an individual loosely without  any  information? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question, as I understand it, that there is an allegation, which to the initial reviewers appeared to be the prominent allegation in the book, that the Governor-General had sought advice from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and that that advice was contrary to the action which the Governor-General took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales has emphatically denied that he ever gave advice of any description to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General whether he has noticed Professor Sawer’s scholarly contribution to this discussion in these terms, referring to the denial by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Street, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refers to the most publicised falsity in that book, namely, that the Governor-General consulted the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales,  Sir Laurence  Street, has emphatically and without equivocation denied - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the denial of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> that he gave any advice directly or indirectly, this is the comment of the pseudo-learned professor: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refers to the denial by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is: Will the Minister representing the Attorney-General, noting the slur that the dubiety of the professor’s statement casts upon the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales, take every step to ensure that the professor is put in the ranks of propagandists and not in any category of learned professors dealing with a subject matter on the basis of scholarship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably when books which are widely publicised, and which undoubtedly will have an extensive reading public, contain statements which are of the importance of those attributed to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and which prove to be demonstrably false, then the value of that book and all that is written in it must be questioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to an article in today’s  Australian  headed Bribes Probe Pacts Signed’ wherein it is stated that the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> had on Monday signed agreements of mutual cooperation with Italy and the Netherlands in the investigations of alleged Lockheed Aircraft Corporation bribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: In view of evidence given before a United States Senate committee by the chief executive officer of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation that some moneys were paid to Australians, is Australia one of the other countries entering into agreement with the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to assist that Department in its investigations into alleged Lockheed bribes of public officials in trying to sell its planes abroad? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Attorney-General ask the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia to list this matter for hearing at the earliest possible moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, will the Attorney-General ask the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to have the application heard by the Full High Court in view of the practice of the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> sitting alone, deciding matters referred to the High Court sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is there someone in the Australian Labor Party today who is prepared to stand up and say that that is a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a denial of the rights of ordinary union members? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are people in the Labor Party who are prepared to come out and raise one solitary voice in favour of truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the defence of one man and do something to preserve the integrity of the Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose he is an inconsequential unionist to the members of the Australian Labor Party, a man who is expendable, who can lose his job in the union, who can be suspended in denial of the rule of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and who can be denied the opportunity of pursuing his employment because he cannot secure membership of his union and therefore cannot get a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As I understand it, the Postal and Telecommunications commissions have a responsibility to function both as independent statutory bodies and in a profitable way, but there is an overriding consideration and that is that the government of the day has the power and the responsibility to intervene where policies may be necessary to provide equity and some form of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government is very concerned about this matter, as is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore who quite recently made some comments about the whole position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I might do is give to the honourable senator and any of his colleagues on both sides of the Senate who are concerned about the matter, copies of the comments made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable senator that he should read the judgment of the learned Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will see that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, drawing on historical precedent, gave an interpretation to that section of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the disqualification provision of section 44 of the Constitution which has been judicially interpreted by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was properly considered and the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court brought down a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never heard anyone suggest, even in the softest tone, that an appeal on the question of law ought to be made to the Full Bench against the decision of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in continuing to expend millions of dollars on the superphosphate bounty during the next 15 months or 16 months when the Government has saved $29m by deferring pension increases, when it has cut funeral benefits for pensioners, when it has taken away the payment of $2 a day for private hospital patients, when it has adopted a more stringent work test for unemployment benefit and when it has taken a variety of other measures to save money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the honourable senator to my address of 4 March last  (Hansard  pages 430-43 1 ) in which I stated that I had written to the  Chairman  of the Remuneration Tribunal,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  W. B. Campbell, formally requesting him to make, inter alia, determinations on the provision of travel within Australia for Senators and Members on parliamentary and electorate business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would it be possible for the Government to investigate a proposal that at least a core of drivers be placed on a permanent basis of employment as a matter of simple industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the Nauruan people, the Christmas Island workers will receive some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to press the question and if we are to give wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these people, then the price of superphosphate most certainly will rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that in all <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the taxpayers, they ought to be in a position to ascertain at their will if they wish the names of the people in receipt of the bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the last motion was dealt with as it was, thus depriving honourable senators of the opportunity to express their views in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that our view of any society, whether it be Indonesia, Chile or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, is based to some extent on the impartiality of its <span class="highlight">justice</span> and of its legal system and by the liberality of its laws and practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister for Social Security knowledge of the remarks made on Monday last by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples in the Industrial Court in granting an application of wool brokers to stand down without pay some 83 people employed in the wool stores in Sydney and Newcastle? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did see the statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that the employers forced them to this method of trying to get wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that only by insisting on an amendment to index these benefits can we guarantee that the Government will do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the pensioners in view of the already abysmal record of this Government and the abysmal record of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in the social welfare field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister and the Government: Where is the <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the equity in this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where <span class="highlight">justice</span> is delayed then <span class="highlight">justice</span> is denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the only thing that needs to be said is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Interim Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, has completed his investigation into the Aboriginal land claim at Victoria River Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall commence with what I consider the discriminatory attitude of the New South Wales AttorneyGeneral and Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Honourable  Mr Maddison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall deal with the peculiar attitude of the New South Wales Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in relation to a combination of State Opposition Legislative Councillors and Australian senators who have made representations to this Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deal with a very mundane subject and that is the appointment of justices of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result a lot of these people seek appointments as justices of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was due to the fact that in New South Wales there is a 6, 7 and 8-month wait before people get to the rather obscure position of being a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without any inhibitions whatsoever that I believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in New South Wales,  Mr Maddison,  has a deliberate phobia about people applying to be justices of the peace who have 2 strikes against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not have raised this matter without extending to the Minister the courtesy of asking him to look at the backlog of applications by people who wish to become justices of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He, too, is fed up to the teeth with the way in which  Mr Maddison  deals with applications by people who wish to become justices of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been waiting for more than 6 months for appointment as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, he could think that an adverse report has been submitted by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was 2 months later that I was told blandly that <span class="highlight">justice</span> had been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the situation was assisted by eminent jurists such as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any honourable senator who has read  La Fiamma  and other ethnic papers will know that there has been a genuine complaint that people with nonAnglo Saxon names must wait longer than anyone else to be appointed as Justices of the Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot remain silent when people ring me to ask: ‘How long have I to wait before I am made a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it does anyone <span class="highlight">justice</span> to carry on this dead issue that has been trumped up again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would be common <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said on that occasion, I thought it was a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that a document which had been tabled in the Parliament containing names which had been legitimately acquired under section 14 of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act could not be read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it seems clear now that the community at large will no longer tolerate this kind of injustice to pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outcry from all sections of the community about this piece of legislation was so great that some honourable senators opposite saw the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the pensioners’ case, had the social conscience to act and voted against their Government’s legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  and his Government will acknowledge the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the pensioners cause when the pensioners come to the Parliament tomorrow to present their case to him and to other members of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that members of the Government will be chastened by their experience over the funeral benefits, that they will seriously consider the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the pensioners claim and that they will drop any other plans they may have to make reductions in the deficit by depriving the pensioners of basic benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be doing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the previous Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  if I did not direct the attention of the Senate to the anticipatory situation which was revealed when he went to Jakarta and had a discussion with  President  Suharto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the last 2 questions, I am not in a position to confirm what action has been taken by the Government nor am I aware of the reasons- assuming the truth of the public reports- why the Church Committee and the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department would have declined to make the names available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  demonstrated this by saying: ‘We brought social <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the independent schools’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It took a government of our faith to break through the prejudice which the Australian Labor Party had created, and bring about social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those people who are entitled to some refund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is important- I am sure I am referring to those people to whom  Senator Maunsell  alluded when he spoke- that these people get some additional benefits so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will not only be done but also it will be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would feel that <span class="highlight">justice</span> had been done to them for the years of service they gave and because they were the people in the early stages of the scheme who actually carried it along. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, said at a local government conference in Sydney last Saturday: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has seen reports that an Aborigine convicted in the South Australian Supreme Court for killing a woman has been handed back to his tribe for tribal law and <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be applied for his misdeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I was somewhat intrigued by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wells’s decision but I assume that he had full power under the laws of South Australia to take such action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, peace is trade union business, but it must be peace with <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will she assure the Senate that every endeavour is being made to bring to <span class="highlight">justice</span> any doctor who obtains an illegal private gain at the expense of the community and the reputation of the medical profession? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no information from the Minister for Health with regard to the number of doctors who have been investigated or those who he claims should be brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span> for illegal practices under the Medibank program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, now  chairman  of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, when sitting as a royal commissioner on local government in New South Wales made a recommendation in relation to local government which was adverted to by the Opposition today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Opposition failed to mention that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell recommended that the true and proper way of establishing equity in financing local government, including equalisation, was to establish a State grants commission and it was upon his recommendation that the New South Wales Government set up a State grants commission in which the equalisation principle has been enshrined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we admit that there may be many flaws in the process of the Grants Commission, the fact is, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell has indicated, that evolution is taking place, that experience is being gained and progress is being made in the regional concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell, the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussing the so-called new federalism policy which really seems to be the old federalism policy of 1900 vintage,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the discussions in Estimates Committee B on Tuesday of this week when  Senator Carrick  indicated a timetable for the final decision by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox regarding uranium extraction, will either  Senator Carrick  or  Senator Withers  take up with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  a comparison between the position of trade unions and conservationists marking time until this historic decision is made and the action of Mary Kathleen Mines in tooling up in anticipation of a favourable decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would respectfully suggest that if everybody else is waiting for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to make his decision, and that will be delivered in accordance with the timetable that  Senator <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice that I have is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will finish taking evidence in August and would hope shortly afterwards to complete the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop has now reported to me and I have consulted with the principal parties to the industry on the details of their submissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having examined all material available concerning the future arrangements for the stevedoring industry, including the position statement prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, and having discussed this statement with major interests in the industry the Government is now able to indicate the course of action it considers appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government notes that in paragraph 54 of his statement  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop identifies the problems arising under the existing arrangements as being- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is pointed out in the detailed position statement prepared by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop no submission made to him favoured the retention of the existing arrangements but with the temporary legislation amended on a permanent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is proposed that to allow this industry to be placed on a basis which is as normal as possible the following steps are to be taken: the existing temporary legislation to be continued until 31 December 1976; the ASIA to continue its existing operations until 31 December 1976; arrangements will be put in hand to assist the staff of the ASIA as outlined earlier; the Stevedoring Industry Council, under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, to continue until 31 December 1976; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be asked to indicate the steps being taken to reduce the existing size of the workforce; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be required to submit for my consideration details of the arrangement proposed to deal with recruitment, redundancy and means of coping with the fluctuating labour requirements of the industry; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be asked to evidence means of securing adequate labour allocation arrangements; satisfactory arrangements have to be determined concerning funding arrangements for the industry; proposed consultative machinery should provide details concerning effective representation of user interests, e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act the jurisdiction of the Court of Disputed Returns may be exercised by a single <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or by a Full Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have in this country a system which is world recognised and in which there is a great deal of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 remind the Senate that I testified before the inquiry into all aspects of security chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and gave specific and documented evidence and suggestions to overcome certain Australian citizenship application injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the periodical reports that are coming out from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, according to the Press, can the Leader of the Government indicate whether this vexed question of a better appeal system on rejected citizenship applications has been finalised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall asking the Minister in charge of excise at the time,  Senator Murphy,  now the honourable <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy, what precautions were taken by the then Government to ensure that brandy from overseas was essentially of the grape and in fact had been in the wood for 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, one would expect of Parties acting out of loyalty to their own class position- these Parties who say that there are no classes- that one of the first targets of their attack would be the Australian Legal Aid Service, which was established by a very great AttorneyGeneral in a Labor Government,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one other, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, who was a member of the Liberal Party, and we have heard no aspersions cast on him by anybody including members of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the emphasis on child endowment and the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> which it brings is an excellent beginning to asking others to bear some cost which is needed to relate Australia’s economic costs to those of its trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also that I have been a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace in Victoria and Tasmania for 1 6 years which I hope will be taken as a reasonable proof of integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked  Senator Guilfoyle,  as the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, on 23 March whether anything could be done to give these people wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Given the necessity of sustaining a tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaign and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the notion that the industry ought to contribute substantially, if not entirely, to the cost of that campaign, it has been argued- I think there is some rationality behind the argument- that it would be fairer to impose a levy on all cattle slaughtered rather than simply on that component of total slaughtering which is exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our marketing system must be more efficient but, to do the marketers <span class="highlight">justice</span>, 1 point out that it is very difficult to compete with our main competitors in New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina for those countries have just had devaluations and therefore can sell their fruit at a far more competitive price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the Taxation Review Committee under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey also saw advantage in a change of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I am sure that I cannot do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all the questions asked by  Senator Kilgariff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We realise the complexities when we read reports by people like the former illustrious member of this Parliament,  Mr Norman  Foster, who is now a member of the Legislative Council in South Australia or a subsequent report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Still vacillating and in its period of indecision, the Labor Government directed  Mr Northrop,  as he then was- now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop- to sample the various opinions as to what reconstruction of the organisation was required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that had this Senate been given the opportunity to debate the position statement on future arrangements for the stevedoring industry prepared by  Mr Northrop,  now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, we would have been able to give to the Minister some indication of the line which he could follow in this most important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This pious hope is doomed to failure and would bring hollow laughs from ex-Prime Minister Gorton, certainly from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, and cynical laughs, as we have heard, from members of the General Practitioners’ Society in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The administration of the system of  criminalband  civil <span class="highlight">justice</span> in so far as it affects the poor and other vulnerable groups such as migrants and children appearing in Children’s Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is need for a determined campaign by all Australians- and that means all parties and all senators who have some understanding of the problem- by all those who value liberty and freedom and the rights of people, to see that this grave miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not ratified and that the incorporation does not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have any conscience at all and if we want to rectify the grave miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that is taking place, then I suggest that, although this matter does not affect our national security but does affect the rights of others, the initiative rests with this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no confidence in approaching that Court seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> in an industrial situation not only because of political reasons- it has been a political court in the past-but also because of the calibre of the work done in that Court because it does not consist of specialists in this very difficult and important jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, whatever happens, I consider that this measure provides no more than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to judges who have worked extremely hard and in very difficult circumstances since the time that this Bill was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again was a matter of policy which was put into this Act with deliberate intent; namely, that we should not have, insofar as  Mr Bentham  is concerned, the sort of statement that where there is no publicity there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has had a long experience with family law and its operations over the years would know that where there is all this publicity there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span>, there is no fairness, there is the scarifying of children and innocent persons because of newspapers and others- I do not need to name them- which over the years made a lot of money out of the embarrassment of people; and that was a very deliberate thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 26 May 1976  (Hansard,  page 1925)  Senator Mulvihill  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime  Minister,  a question without notice concerning the reports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attention has been drawn to comments made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Demack of the Family Court of Australia in  The Courier Mail  of 2 1 May 1 976 concerning the inadequacy of the temporary premises of the Court in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first is that the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has not yet been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall that, in answer to a question in the last session of this Parliament, I was promised information concerning the number of unions which had altered their rules in order to comply with the provisions of section 133a and section 140 ( 1 ) (d) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as required by the 1974 amendments to that Act introduced on the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney by the then Minister for Labor and Immigration, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way at least the man who was entitled to <span class="highlight">justice</span> of one sort or another could get access to technical and legal advice to enable him to protect himself against the action of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia acting under the foreign power of section 5 1 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>

    <p>The agreement is for mutual assistance in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You have a policy of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but unfortunately a lot of your comrades in your Party do not have that sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot do the people <span class="highlight">justice</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why can the States not do the people <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will consider these facts in the light of <span class="highlight">justice</span> toward a people who came as strangers to this land, and that appropriate action will be taken to remedy the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it a fact that, since the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose was tabled in the Parliament on 19 February, all ex-service organisations have made submissions to the Minister, generally supporting the recommendations of the inquiry, which has been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article contained allegations by a former Australian Telecommunications Commission linesman who, incidentally, was a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace, that telephone subscribers were footing the bill for Australia-wide calls recorded on subscribers ‘ meters but made by Commission technicians with tapping devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the conflict between the information provided in the Minister’s answer last week and the allegations made in the article by, I remind the Minister, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace last May, I ask: What checks are or can be made on the improper use of private subscribers’ telephone lines and how can these subscribers be protected against a betrayal of a position of trust by such people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What a malignant cancer on the much vaunted system of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>’! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be fair to say that the Bill puts into legislative form the spirit of the Judges Rules as to the manner in which the interview should be carried out, and in fact follows closely the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, in relation to the investigation of offences as set out in Appendix B of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A magistrate or <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, therefore, will expedite the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> without favour to the defence or to the prosecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To dramatically illustrate this language difficulty, and other associated difficulties, encountered by my people and their dealings with the law, I intend drawing freely on pertinent passages of the judgment handed down by his honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster, in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia, when dismissing the charges against the accused in the case which is reported as ‘Nos 58-61 of 1975  The Queen  v.  Angas Anunga, Sandy Ajax, Clancy Ajax,  v.  Tjingunya  and also Nos 207 and 208 of 1975  The Queen  v.  Nan Wheeler  and  Frankie Miller Jagamala  To simplify matters these cases are commonly referred to as, ‘The Paula Sweet Case’ and, in fact, some of the glaring injustices surrounding the investigation of this case, were the subject of a documentary on Australian Broadcasting Commission television in its program  Four Corners,  which I sincerely trust that honourable senators had the privilege, or should I more properly say, the dismay, of seeing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the language difficulties,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster, on pages 3 and  4  of his Reasons for Judgment, says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I say, and I am authorised to say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward agree, may be taken as an expression of the Court’s view, not only my own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster and, as you see, with the concurrence of his brothers Muirhead and Ward, recognised a problem, and at least in the Northern Territory- one of the present ‘hot beds’ of Aborigine-police relationssaw that it was of such importance, that certain guidelines were laid down for police to observe when dealing with Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster has gone as far as he can in his court and has locally dealt with the accepted conduct of police investigations of offences alleged to have been committed by Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) What specific instructions has the Minister, or the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, given to the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, since 1 1 November 1975, relating to the nature and scope of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward’s inquiries as Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, will the Minister provide the full text of the written instruction to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, referred to in an article in  National Review  dated 6-12 August 1976, in relation to differentiation between claims based on need and claims based on tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The only specific instruction given to the Interim Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, since 1 1 November 1975 on the nature and scope of his inquiries was in a telegram of 27 July informing him that the Government believes it would be inappropriate for hearings on traditional claims such as those relating to the South Alligator River and Borroloola areas to proceed prior to the legislation being enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As indicated, the only instruction to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward is that referred to above which related to the suspension of hearings of traditional claims rather than to ‘differentiation between claims based on needs and claims based on tradition’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department in June asked  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward to provide a list of claims received indicating the stage reached in hearings and whether the applications were based on traditional claim or on need, but no instructions were given as suggested in the article in the  National Review  of 6-12 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the full text of the instruction sent to the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, advising him that hearings of claims by Aboriginals to traditional land in the Northern Territory have been suspended until the Federal Government’s land rights legislation has been passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what requests were made by the Company/Companies concerned and, did the submissions made by the Company/Companies influence the decision to suspend further hearings by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward less than one month before the date set by the Interim Commissioner for a hearing into claims by the Borroloola Aboriginal Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government’s decision to suspend the activities of the Interim Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, placed in jeopardy some Aboriginal land claims that are also the subject of future negotiations with mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Interim Land Commissioner will be receiving and registering traditional land claims to vacant Crown lands and, as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, land will not be leased if it is subject to Aboriginal claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister had any discussions, either formal or informal, or correspondence, with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward regarding the latter’s possible removal or retirement from the position of Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of us are well aware that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose took a long time to produce his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a little concerned that the only other recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose which is mentioned in the statement made by the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Durack)  is the possibility of the use of the American Medical Association’s  Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment  for the assessment of appropriate pension levels for each repatriation pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that consideration should be given to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose ‘s report and other people’s views on the whole repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote the indictment at page 9 of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo, a very sound jurist who, by no stretch of the imagination, could be called a socialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone tell me that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under Medibank I will be taxed on my earnings and I will receive <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country, and I suggest this to the Health Ministers, we would bring those people to the bar of the Senate and ask them to explain how they swindled people like me as they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a crusade with me to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know where  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo is tonight but I pay tribute to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that view fit in with the view expressed in this chamber by former  Senator Murphy,  now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, and the view expressed by  Mr Whitlam  before he became Prime Minister of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood  asked’ me whether that view is in accordance with other views expressed by notable Labor leaders, particularly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, as he now is, and even the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there are even higher authorities on this subject than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy or  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia and one of the founders of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question for all Australians is whether we stand for a society embodying <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness and equality of sacrifice and equality of privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I firmly believe they stand for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, for the fair go, they will throw out this disgraceful Budget and with it throw out this discredited Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to the Governor-General to obtain advice on the constitutional question from other quarters- perhaps from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Attorney-General or eminent counsel- and then a solemn responsibility rests on him to make a judgment on whether a dissolution is needed to serve the purpose of good Government … by giving to the electorate the duty of resolving a situation which Parliament cannot resolve for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our arrangements have ensured that social <span class="highlight">justice</span> will continue to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not concerned just with questions of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people in this community who believe in <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equality before the law have an obligation to pay our share of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to point out to the Senate- particularly in view of the remarks of  Senator Harradine-  that neither this Government nor any other government has operated the user pay principle in a strict sense to the running of courts and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, there were the Premiers of the States and there was this chamber which had to go to ultimate lengths not only in the interpretation of the Constitution but also in the prostitution of the conventions of this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present the text of an arrangement between the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Australian AttorneyGeneral ‘s Department dated 13 September 1976 intituled ‘Procedures for mutual assistance in administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in connection with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation matter’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the present Committee and its immediate predecessors held discussions with the Department of the Capital Territory to determine a new format for the plan, following criticism by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in  Kent  v.

    <p>Although the rate of progress towards economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> has undoubtedly been very slow and there are very many poor people and very many underprivileged people in that country, progress has been made and that progress has been made within a democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a great policy of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and  Senator Gietzelt,  a Labor supporter, is seemingly critical of that policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will recall that some time ago he told me, following my testimony before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who was looking at the restructuring of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, that he thought that reports were coming through to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  that they could be released, and that probably they would indicate that we should have what they have in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sangster ‘s opinion on no account could one ever entertain such a plea; it was obvious that he was guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sangster ‘s opinion he was guilty from the start and whatever may be the capabilities of the legal counsel that he had, they could not get a verdict other than guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now put it to the Minister In the light of the report that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox conferred with the Prime Minister yesterday, does he still stand by the assurance that the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, will alone define the boundaries of that park? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I elaborate on that aspect, I turn to a consideration of the massive report that was presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have met  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in other fields would have no doubt that his was the ideal appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not trying to anticipate the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox findings, but  Senator Carrick  pointed out that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  and the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann)  could make a decision in relation to the dimensions of this national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Senate that the sentence of Bishop Lamont to 10 years’ gaol was a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is perhaps unfair to select one area of the four and to say that the Minister has not done that <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the present Government is continuing at about that increased level of expenditure- there have been cuts in some areas and there have been increases in some areas, but there has been no attempt as yet and I hope there will be no attempt in the future to drop the level of expenditure on education back to the percentage of the gross domestic product which applied before 1972-1 believe is further evidence of the <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the need for the policies that were introduced by  Mr Beazley  and by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would give some semblance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people who are paid under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there are <span class="highlight">justice</span> and logic in the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is disgraceful that the injured in this country, on the one hand, are not receiving <span class="highlight">justice</span> and just compensation for theninjuries and that the employers, particularly the small employers, are having to pay out large premiums because of the compensation system based on antiquated ideas and the antiquated method used in establishing people’s rights to compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adversary principle which exists, the necessity for proving negligence in many cases, and the complicated legal procedures mitigate against <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the appearance of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in these cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, great injustice has been caused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later we Will be moving an amendment to give some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people who are looked after by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is inadequate to give full <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but the increased payments to these people have been delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people have not been given <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this legislation and they should be given <span class="highlight">justice</span> because the cost of living has increased just as much for widows as it has for children, as it has for the dependants of people who unfortunately died or, indirectly, as it has for funeral directors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason these increases are 25 per cent instead of 40 per cent which applies in the rest of the Bill, I do not believe, can be found in any argument based on logic or <span class="highlight">justice</span> but can be found, I believe, when we look at the economic obsession of the present Government and at State legislation in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This principle may be in the true conservative tradition, but it hardly gives <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who are injured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to widows or to the wives of the injured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is wrong that the national Parliament should be constrained from giving <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people under this legislation by reason of the fact that some States have inadequate legislation, that some States are less generous than others and we must not rock the boat or people in those States will demand <span class="highlight">justice</span> at the level that is received in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Labor Party was in Government we appointed a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of a very distinguished jurist and world respected authority on compensation law,  Sir Owen  Woodhouse, a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the New Zealand Court of Appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With him, taking part in the inquiry, was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares, a very distinguished judge from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse was being held one of the most able, intelligent and wellinformed leaders of the insurance industry in Australia,  Mr Pettigrew,  the Managaing Director of Sun Alliance Insurance Ltd, pointed out to the inquiry, as he has pointed out subsequently, that the burdens which were being imposed on insurers for workers compensation insurance and motor vehicle third party insurance were so great that we were entering into the beginnings of a national calamity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be remembered that the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares was not only a report on compensation but it was a report on rehabilitation and compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our approach was the approach of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares, that there were 3 areas which had to be dealt with in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opening remarks I paid tribute to the vision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the legislation fairly faithfully records  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I commend  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In common with the Labor Party, I pay tribute to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to the reports that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues have written to the Minister urging extreme caution on the interpretation of their first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This intention was given support by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in the first report of the Aboriginal Land Right Commission in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, yesterday in the Senate in answer to a question from  Senator Mulvihill  I said that I had been instructed that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development had not received a letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has in fact received a number of letters from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister has discussed the matter satisfactorily with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I think, the principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> being what they are, there is validity in a comparison of the Western Australian Act and the provision in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where an inspector has reason to believe that a person has failed to comply with a notice given to the person under subsection 1 1 ( 1 ), the inspector may make application to a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace for a warrant authorizing the inspector, with or without persons and equipment to assist him, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the person has failed to comply with the notice - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest strongly to the Minister that he either explain the matter reasonably or be prepared, in the conciliatory attitude in which he has approached the Bill, to have another look at it to see whether it can be broken down in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, on an application under sub-section (2), the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace is satisfied by information on oath or affirmation that the issue of the warrant is reasonably required for the purposes of that sub-section, the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace may grant a warrant accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is an obligation on the inspector by oath or affirmation to satisfy a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace that he ought to have these powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He must satisfy a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the due administration of the law any <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace to whom application was made for a search warrant would satisfy himself that the inspector really has cause and can satisfy him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again, it is not as though this power is written in for the inspector; he must satisfy a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, having said that, there is always a feeling- a suspicion- on the part of people that, once a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace issues a search warrant of that type, a person occupying a position of authority, by the wearing of a uniform, might exceed to the utmost the powers of the search warrant rather than use the minimum powers of the search warrant when that might be sufficient for the purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of this Bill undoubtedly have received the attention of someone who is described as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> within the Nauruan legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the conception which the Minister admits has a very august parent in the person of the former Attorney-General and present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick-  would have removed from State courts the bulk of the federal jurisdiction exercised by those courts and greatly weakened the status of those courts and the quality of the work dealt with by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill was introduced in 1968 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen, as he now is, but it was not proceeded with and then, as I have said, the proposal introduced by the Labor Government was thrown out by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-in reply- I am pleased that the Opposition, although moving an amendment to the Federal Court of Australia Bill, is in fact supporting the measures, and even more so because  Senator James  McClelland has referred to the august progenitor of this whole concept, namely, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the percentage increase in salary for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court is 16.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, his statement outlined three areas of special concern to the Government: Measures aimed at securing cost restraint; measures to protect the interests of the staff of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority; and measures to overcome the problems of the industry as had been identified in the report presented to me by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> can occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to one or two people from at least one organisation with which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of the High Court had problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that people can be the victims of a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that the Government expedite an implementation of the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having presented submissions to the  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and having had a long interview with him, I say strongly to the Minister that, whatever  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has in mind and conveys to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  if my submissions are not included in his report the Government will expedite the appeal system which applies in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps his latter words are not relevant because divisions have been made as to the names of the bodies concerned but obviously it is essential that there should be co-operation between the Federal and State ombudsmen so that people with complaints who go to the wrong body are facilitated in going to the right person to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in carrying out his work the Ombudsman will co-operate with his State colleagues to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people who have a problem with administration even if they are not certain whether it is a State or Federal matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Injustices, whether real or imaginary, must be undone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every effort must be made to undo any imaginary injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If l egitimate, it must be attended to and <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure from what  Senator Mulvihill  told us that his views have been taken on board by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation was made almost impotent in 1967 when a professed improvement followed on 2 years on consultation presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, as he now is, which gave rise to what was called permanent employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements are being made in discussions under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and the Government is very pleased that the  President  of the Commission has been able to make available a judge of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson’s distinction in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the immediate problem which the Government is tackling and which it hopes to be able to solve under the skilful chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s view it can be resolved only by negotiation, and that is why the negotiations under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson are proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land councils will continue to represent Aboriginal traditional owners in negotiations over land use, over mineral developments, and will be further strengthened, in line with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, by giving them the function of assisting Aborigines to bring forward land claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the early tasks for the Commissioner will be the consideration of the strength of traditional claims to the pastoral leases held by Aboriginal groups- not only the properties of Kildurk and Willowra, which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward considered in his report, but the property held by the Gurindji group at Wave Hill, and the several other properties since bought for Aboriginal communities by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission or now being purchased by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where Aborigines have agreed to mineral exploration the Bill provides, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward proposed, that development of any economic discovery made would follow, subject only to agreement on terms and conditions, provided that the development is substantially in accord with the proposals consented to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is the Government’s intention, as it was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s recommendation, that existing rights inland will be fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious <span class="highlight">justice</span> and common sense in this arrangement has appealed to the Pharmacy Guild as it has appealed to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues have given the Parliament an excellent report; but there have been many reports of a similar nature in different countries before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has made clear is that the magnitude of the problem justifies detailed debate in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider that picture as a whole we can see that there would be a tremendous potential for nuclear power around the world and where, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox points out, it can be shown that the development of the industry will not be harmful to mankind we ought to avail ourselves of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But nowhere in the Fox report can I find a definitive statement where  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox says straight out that there is justification to go ahead now with the mining and export of our uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, on pages 108 and 1 10  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox makes several points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have no alternative but to go ahead and look for further energy sources, and in that regard perhaps I could quote from the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox deals with nuclear energy and alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also an interesting quote from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, who said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox said when he dealt with the vulnerability of modern society today and its dependence upon crude oil and our known energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would regret it if the arguments about the export of a few thousand tonnes from Mary Kathleen, which will make no difference to the world ‘s attitude to nuclear power and which will make no difference to the supplies which go to Japan, West Germany and the United States, should become the basis of the very real argument which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry have brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not condemned by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to allow the full public debate which has been asked for by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues and not just to accept a debate in the 2 Houses, with ten or twelve members of this Parliament speaking for 20 minutes each so soon after the Ranger inquiry report has come out, as the basis for a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues obviously had strong reservations on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the  Australian Financial Review  said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox was worried that the first report had been interpreted as providing for an open house on uranium extraction and that he had approached the Government to reinforce what I interpreted to be the caution involved, I was told that uranium mining was not on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should wait until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox brings down report No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a fair idea of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will say at that stage, and we will see what the Prime Minister and  Mr Anthony  will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important reason why the Government should not make hasty decisions is, in the words used by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox at his press conference last Thursday, that the Aboriginal-land-rights legislation now before the Parliament could create problems for the commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">JUSTICE</span> Fox and the two commissioners from the Ranger environmental inquiry have attacked the Government over its interpretation of the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>GOVT ADMITS <span class="highlight">JUSTICE</span> FOX LETTER ON INTERPRETATION <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government yesterday admitted that it had received a letter from <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox of the Ranger uranium inquiry criticising the government’s interpretation of its first report, despite denying this in Parliament on Tuesday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement issued after question time  Senator Carrick  said that  Mr Newman  had in fact received a number of letters from <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, one of which was concerned with ‘the interpretation that has been placed on the commission’s first report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He understood that  Mr Newman  had discussed the matter satisfactorily with <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several letters have been exchanged between <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox and myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the suggestion by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox that there should be debate on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people seek <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this land which is rightfully theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the maintenance bans were lifted as from 8 o’clock this morning following a conference before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the success which I have been able to report of the conference this morning with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson and the lifting of the bans as a result of that conference emphasise the importance which the Government has always stressed, and always will stress, of the parties to a dispute taking the dispute before the Commission and having the processes of the Commission and the laws observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the honourable senator look at the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is he aware of a letter to the Prime Minister from the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace calling upon the Government to renew its efforts towards persuading the Indonesian Government to allow international aid organisations into East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has blocked the hearing of land claims at Borroloola claims that should have been heard on 26 August this year, but by direction of the Government  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward was forbidden to hear them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity, this nation can have no lesser aim for the survivors of a people who have been so disadvantaged by changes forced on their traditional and highly specialised way of life and, until recently, so ignored by the national conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It drew attention at that stage to the requirements of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill represents one of the great steps along the road to providing this <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second reading debate let us at least acknowledge that we are moving in a real way towards the provision of land rights and greater <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this land rights legislation does no more than offer <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a humanitarian way to the indigenous people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who saw the work done by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward will realise that it is unfortunate that this aspect of the legislation has not been allowed to stand as it was before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving to a group which has been working in the Territory, the missionary group, I will deal firstly with the Victorian Council of Churches, who supported  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in this way: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that he believed Aborigines seek correction and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in respect of past mistakes but they do not, to the best of his knowledge, seek to achieve this by turning the sword of discrimination against their non-Aboriginal neighbours’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I know,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn has not been mentioned in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I think that the manner in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn handled the Nabalco land case- although of course he eventually made a finding which was adverse to those claiming a native title or an Aboriginal title- and the judgment which he set out did a lot to educate people in the community to the fact that there really is a relationship between the Aboriginal people and the land they occupy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one am grateful to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn for the very great care he took in preparing that judgment, for the careful way in which he set it out and for the contribution which he has made to broadening the understanding by the Australian community of the Aboriginal relationship to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, who was given a commission by the Labor Government in 1973 to report upon the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very significant that as soon as the report was put down by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward it received bipartisan support from the parties in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One ought to acknowledge that in all spheres of the political system in Australia there was an immediate reaction to the report that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward put down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s report there has been basically no real argument in Australia against the establishment of Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I think, is a great tribute to the quality of the work done by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn in his judgment refers to the Aborigines’ relationship to land which has no comparison, no parallel, in our law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are committed to a continuing examination to make sure that the traditional owners in fact are protected under the structures we are seeking to provide for them in accordance with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my reading of the Woodward report, I believe that the amended provisions now in the Bill are consistent with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 708 of the second report, firstly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again I turn to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, in the same paragraph sub-paragraph (xx). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator referred to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn had to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other, which was handed down a little later by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Foster, I think it was, following the Royal Commission in Western Australia, went into the legal aspects of the claim of Aboriginals to land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill that ignores the Woodward report and refuses to put into operation the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said that great harm can be done if benefits are extended to some native people and not to others, whether by reason of degree of native blood or historical or geographical factors, particularly if decisions as to entitlements within the community are made outside the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My opinion is contrary to that of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My brother Aborigines look to you,  Sir, and  to honourable senators and we ask you- we even beg, if necessary- for <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The answer to the first part of the question is yes, not only in respect of those particular matters, but generally across the whole range of recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose which number three hundred and three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a petition organised by the Australia-Israeli Medical Association, signed by 260 doctors throughout Australia and delivered to the U.S.S.R. Embassy in March 1976, seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> for  Dr Mikhail  Shtern of Vinniktsa Ukraine, who for an extended period has been under arrest and denied migration to Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned with the clause because, as honourable senators will know,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report recommended that these powers should be held by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to agree with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be further strengthened in line with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward by giving them the function of assisting Aboriginals to bring forward land claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to assure him that amendments to the Bill since it was originally introduced in June protect existing interests as was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward envisaged that Territory law would deal with the protection of sacred sites in clause 44 (3) of his draft Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward excluded town areas from claims that would be dealt with under any legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward noted in relation to oil and gas at paragraph 704 of his report that the financial interests of Aborigines would be well served by the appropriation of a 10 per cent royalty payment to their benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is a mining company and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said that we have to preserve present contracts, we now have these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, in paragraph 109 of his second report, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 274 of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised to hear  Senator Missen  quote the very same extracts from the Woodward report as I had intended to quote at this point of the Committee stage because it seems to me that any reasonable interpretation of the extracts which were just quoted would lead one to the conclusion that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward did intend that needs claims rather than traditional claims be included in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is to give effect to those recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, which were that the Aboriginal Land Commissioner have jurisdiction to make recommendations relating to grants of land for Aboriginals within towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several of us spoke in the second reading debate about the needs of people living in fringe areas of Alice Springs and I do not think there is any need to repeat them, but if Government supporters who spoke at such length about their concern to rectify the wrongs done to Aboriginal people and to make up to the Aboriginal people for the destruction of their culture and their traditional way of life meant what they said for one minute then I fail to see how they can refuse to support this amendment because it is those people, as <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward said, who have been moved away from their traditional land in camps around Alice Springs and similar places who are the worst victims of the racism of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proper way for all Aboriginal people to make land claims should be through the Land Commissioner as <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward recommends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope to get some support if we are deciding matters on logic and in a desire to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, he read what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot accept that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward excluded fringe dwellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the use of the terms ‘alienated’ and unalienated’, which has the effect of excluding the land in the towns, prevents the Commission doing the very things that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said that he wanted it to do and it should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward also found that possibly the whole of the site of Darwin is located on tribal Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has already decided that most of the land claimed in Alice Springs, for example, will be granted under the Northern Territory leasehold system as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward was thoroughly conscious of the need to provide within Australia domestic law for the traditional interests of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership rights of Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recalled that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, when speaking of town claims, clearly indicated that the tenure of any land in towns by Aboriginals should be the same kind of tenure as that for all other persons and that any request for such land should go through the normal town planning procedures of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 625  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause protects existing mining interests, as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and accepted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s draft legislation provided protection for all interests, including interests- I quote him- ‘agreed to be granted by the Crown’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comments of the Opposition in relation to this matter do not state fully the attitudes of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward on this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the belief that Government senators who have an interest in Aboriginal affairs, such as  Senator Chaney, Senator Baume  and  Senator Bonner,  should take  Senator Wright  aside and tell him that this is a question of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">justice</span> rather than legal <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recalled that  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward at paragraph 89 of his report recommended the use of a trust, that is a land trust, in all cases for convenience of legislation and ease of understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said in his report that the only time that a rnining interest would have a right to go into Aboriginal lands would be if it were in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that there would not be some frivolous claim that it was in the national interest  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward put in his report the safeguard that the Governor-General had to make a proclamation- I take it on the advice of the Minister- that it would be in the national interest and that proclamation had to be laid before the Parliament in accordance with the regulations which provide that in each House of the Parliament a motion may be moved to disagree with the declaration in the proclamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question of common <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Keeffe  does not do much <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his own Bill when he implies that he introduced it in the belief that it would never be debated in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended that a declaration of national interest should not be in accordance with the opinion of the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-section ( IB) gives effect to paragraph 708, sub-paragraphs (x), (xi) and (xii), of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s recommendations which provide that matters of concern should be given emphasis when mining rights are being negotiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause to be omitted effectively castrates- that is probably the most appropriate word- the role of the Commissioner which was envisaged by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and given legislative substance by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is tempted to reflect on whether that is due to the success of the interim commission of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward and his adjudication of land claims heard so far this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this amendment is accepted by the Government, it will strengthen the Government’s hand in ensuring that those people get some sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of projects designed to assess the effectiveness of agencies within the Australian criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> systems are at present being undertaken and sponsored by these bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee is, in conjunction with its work in preparation for the Congress, examining what improvements might be made to Australian criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> processes and what contribution might be made by Australia at the international level in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senior officers of a number of agencies within the Australian criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> systems, including Police Commissioners of the States and the Commonwealth, already meet at regular intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister to a statement that the Roman Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace reportedly in letters to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out the serious conflict between the Australian Government’s recent action and its stated policy on East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The retention of the power by the Australian Parliament and Government was also recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and supported by the Senate Select Committee on Social Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward made recommendations which, if adopted, would permit reasonable access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that careful scrutiny of the way in which this clause is framed and the way in which we look at the operation of complementary legislation will ensure that we do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to our Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be an implied rebuke in the words which I am now going to address to you,  Mr Chairman,  but both  Senator Bonner  and  Senator Cavanagh  are doing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people whose cause they seek to espouse by describing the Aboriginal people as anything else but what they are, namely, citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that the matter can be properly investigated at a later date, so that the people who signed the original telegram can be cleared- there were about thirty of them; half of them changed their minds and did not want to be associated with it and the other half wanted more time to talk to their people- and for the sake of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Aboriginal people, to the senior departmental officer and to others concerned, I hope that somewhere along the line a reference will go to the standing committee which is yet to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement between the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and my Department for mutual assistance in connection with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation matter and tabled in the House of Representatives on S October last requires that information made available pursuant thereto should be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties or to government agencies having no law enforcement responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 3 November 1976  Senator Wheeldon  addressed to me, as Minister representing the Attorney-General in the Senate, a question without notice concerning the refusal by the Attorney-General of a request by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Western Australia that proceedings be instituted to secure the extradition of a Maureen Ann Ritzell from Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a letter dated 13 September 1976 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Western Australia requested me to initiate proceedings for the extradition of a Maureen Ann Ritzell from Singapore on charges of disobeying a lawful court order and child stealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I informed the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, extradition cannot be sought on the charge of disobeying a court order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always agreed with the dictum that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only the members of the Opposition who are trying to make cheap political capital out of the situation that does nothing more than give simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Tasmanian fruit growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 7 December 1976  (Hansard,  page 269S)  Senator Mcintosh  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning a letter from the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace about the return of international aid organisations to East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just make the point that when we talk about trials and what is at the other end we might have to bite on the bullet and prove very definitely that we regard nationals of countries to the far right and to the far left in the same way and apply the law with even handed <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be clear that we will have even handed <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that <span class="highlight">justice</span> did prevail in the end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, with these mad snipers or mad bombers, when we talk about deterrents we have to say that we will have even handed <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it was terrified that the success we had in persuading the work force to accept wage indexation would be eroded because there was a great deal of uneasiness in the union movement as to whether merely keeping up with the cost of living constituted wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949, when Chifley introduced the security service in Australia (ASIO) under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed of the South Australian Supreme Court, he established the conditions under which Australia could, and in fact did, become a party to the secret agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose he would be the transcendent exponent of the rules of evidence properly applicable in courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the words of Wigmore, the preeminent authority on the rules of evidence in relation to courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to that because, of course, courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> exercise a most anxious judgment to produce an accurate rule applicable to each situation so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> according to law will be done in the law courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the distinction between the authority and the right, and therefore the responsibility, of a House of Parliament discharging the tremendously comprehensive responsibilities of public affairs and that of a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is dealing with the sometimes narrow issues as between litigants and sometimes the Crown and the defendant in criminal cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long ago as 1918, the High Court held in Alexander’s Case that section 72 requires that every <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court and every <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of any other court created by the Commonwealth Parliament shall, subject to the power of removal contained in that section, be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has, in consequence, been generally accepted that Justices of the High Court, and other Federal Judges including Magistrates, cannot be required to retire on reaching a specified age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An existing Judge will, however, become subject to the retirement requirements of the amendment if, after the amendment takes effect, he accepts appointment to another office of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the same Court having a different status or designation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of a Court were, after the amendment took effect, to accept appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of that Court, he would thereafter be subject to the retirement age applicable to any <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span>, I think, has now been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that  Senator Button  did <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the kinds of procedures which have been suggested or which are envisaged because at all times there is a capacity to seek a wider choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all Australians concerned with <span class="highlight">justice</span> will feel some disappointment, and surely some apprehension also, that this appointment is being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I took the matter up in order to obtain some <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, will accordingly observe common <span class="highlight">justice</span> and proper humanity by inviting duly authorised representatives of the present Rhodesian government to Australia to do what they have not been allowed to do before, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia’s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that because the Labor Party originally wrote in the 10 per cent principle on a general basis in line with its platform of equality in voting values, and because the Liberal and National Country Parties are now generally adopting the principle of 10 per cent, the distribution commissioners should do all that can be done within their existing guidelines to ensure electoral <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of my Party I think I can pay tribute to the High Court for in many ways its attitudes and decisions find a parallel in the United States Supreme Court under Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Warren in the time of the Republican era of President Eisenhower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no confidence in approaching that Court seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> in an industrial situation not only because of political reasons- it has been a political court in the past- but also because of the calibre of the work done in that Court because it does not consist of specialists in this very difficult and important jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section  171c  as originally drafted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and which was set out in the appendix to his report was itself administrative in character although it was to be exercised by the Court and was only later given the quality of an explicitly judicial function in the redraft by  Mr Comans  when preparing the Conciliation and Arbitration (Organisations) Bill of  1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These, then, were the general areas of dispute over which argument ranged; of course my description, confined to a few sentences, does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the fullness of the arguments relied upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director-General of the Department of Social Security, on the advice of the SolicitorGeneral and the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott),  regards this matter as still incomplete and subject to discussion with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen and the other parties if they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the Opposition is telling selective truths and is not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to itself in the whole treatment of the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Minister for Health (  Mr Hunt)  who has been consistently concerned about the position in the Australian Capital Territory it is necessary to put the record straight and to indicate what the position is in the A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no confidence in approaching that  Court  seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> in an industrial situation not only because of political reasons- it has been a political court in the past- but also because of the calibre of the work done in that Court because it does not consist of specialists in this very difficult and important jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recognise that some honourable senators in support of their position in respect of this matter have recited a letter that all honourable senators received from the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was over the signature of  Mr  Mauro  Di Nicola, National Secretary of the Catholic Commision for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider, as does the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace- people seem to be quoting that organisation all the time along with unnamed religious sources here, there and  everywhere- that the terms of reference should be unlimited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the Government’s attitude to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> inviting such a challenge in a gratuitous and political manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-72">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is urgent that the Senate and the House Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common <span class="highlight">justice</span> and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia’s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues, as I understood it then, had not finished their editing of their report and the AGPS does not have the full text of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action has been taken to ensure the implementation of the findings of a marine court of inquiry, under the control of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt, which recommended a new code in regard to fighting fires which involved petroleum products? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Because of the grave implications these statements have for the Governor-General particularly in regard to his actions prior to and on 1 1 November 1975, will the Prime Minister draw this article to the attention of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who has been inquiring into the intelligence and security services, for him to make an investigation and report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770428_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask: If  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope decides that the matter warrants his attention, will the Prime Minister ensure that the Governor-General is recalled from overseas to facilitate such investigation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770428_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since a long way back that court has comprised a single <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court from whose decision there is no right of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to our law of <span class="highlight">justice</span> it was found to be a wrongful dismissal but the company would not take him back until all avenues in law were explored, simply for the purpose of keeping the man involved unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Needless to say, I regard these circumstances as repugnant to any sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those assumptions made by the Government and by  Mr Cameron,  the Minister in the previous Government, do not accord with the decision given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers in the Industrial Court in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure  Senator Bonner  that I and the rest of my colleagues in Government have just as keen an interest in the upholding of Liberal principles and the pursuit of truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> as has he or as have any of his Queensland Liberal Party colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also not true that the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen in the Karen Green case was to say that the Government acted in breach of the law in denying those school leavers unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not the Government’s responsibility to take action as a result of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen’s ruling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second question raised the matter of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen’s judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to the decision by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster in the Northern Territory Supreme Court to uphold the appeals by 3 men against a conviction of attempting to export illegally firearms and medical supplies to East Timor from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the determination of the Prime Minister in 1976 to have the case prosecuted, does the Government intend to appeal against  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Forster ‘s decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commissioner on Security and Intelligence,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, who was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in August 1974, has recently completed a most extensive series of investigations and reports on all aspects of Australian intelligence and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has made recommendations to increase the effectiveness of our internal security arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations have already been the subject of detailed study and I shall be making a statement to the House after my return from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London about the Government’s decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my belief that the Director-General of ASIO,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, carries out this responsibility creditably and faithfully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition, whose Government appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, has recently re-affirmed in the House his confidence in the DirectorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only question for the Court will be whether the action is lawful, in the sense that it is within the power conferred on the relevant Minister or official or body, that prescribed procedures have been followed and that general rules of law, such as conformity to the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, have been observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court may quash or set aside the decision or part of the decision, refer the matter back to the decision-maker for further consideration subject to such directions as the Court thinks fit, make an order declaring the rights of the parties in respect of which the order relates, or direct any of the parties to do or refrain from doing any act or thing where the Court considers this necessary to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second and third items to which we wish strongly to draw attention relate to payment from the Treasurer’s Advance Account to a former <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia of $47,500 in lieu of long leave and $2,500 for unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and the payment of $40,500 in lieu of long leave to a former Chief Judge of the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-66-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was informed that a Cabinet decision made in 1967 did provide for such payments to be made to judges of Federal Courts but did not include justices of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-66-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Committee does not quarrel with the principle that justices of the High Court and judges of other Federal courts should be remunerated for long leave, it considers that the arrangements not founded on statutory authority which prevailed in previous years and enabled payments to be made from public funds should forthwith be terminated and that the Government should introduce into the Parliament appropriate legislation to remedy the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-66-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be argued if the Commonwealth Public Service Board seeks wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these people, quite apart from the emoluments which would result from permanency, that it may not have the ability to assess wages, as in the air traffic controllers case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to believe that we do not leave this matter to the oil companies to do it their way, but that we issue stringent conditions along the lines suggested by the judicial inquiry which I think was controlled by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Evatt, a very illustrious name in the judicial field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brandeis, notorious for his understanding of the needs of the ordinary trade union and the working man who wants to work and earn in a prosperous society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in the last year of my existence in this place, I am putting forward this proposition in the hope that we will be able to formulate a new sense of purpose to enable parliamentary government to be the reality that people believe it is and in the hope that we will not yield to the assaults from both inside and outside to which I have referred and to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brandeis and Lord George-Brown most purposefully referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the Government is pleased that, as recently announced,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has agreed to become an adviser to me on policy matters relating to nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will be putting down his report tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Republic of Ireland,  Mr Cooney,  has rejected calls for an independent inquiry on the matter, denying that conditions in the gaol were as the critics described them and saying that there was nothing to inquire into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question concerns the social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and, in fact, the fairness of the Government in singling out this group of people, these school leavers, and depriving them of unemployment benefits when others in the community were not so deprived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, of course, questioned the natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> of such an action in taking all benefits from all unemployed school leavers to catch a few who might be cheating on the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was suggested at the time, and as has been backed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen now, this was contrary to section 107 (c) of the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the gist of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen’s judgment is this: Miss Green- the Judge pointed out that hers was not an exceptional case and that in fact there were thousands like it in the community- was subject to an inflexible rule which prevented her from being considered for unemployment benefits until the end of the school vacation, the school vacation which started last November or early December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> must be done and <span class="highlight">justice</span> must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for that reason that on the last occasion when this matter arose 1 had incorporated in  Hansard  the complete text of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> was not done to his judgment by members of the Opposition and by other interested parties, some of whom have been mentioned by the honourable senator today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen restated the provisions of section 107 of the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen makes the comment that paragraph (c)- that one which talks of the satisfaction of the DirectorGeneral is not directly concerned with factual circumstances but rather with the state of mind of the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 5 of his printed judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said that there is no doubt that it was not until 22 February 1977 that the Director-General became satisfied in terms of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 24 of his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it does them less than credit continually to talk of illegality in the way in which they do, and continually to misrepresent the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the judgment which I have read in part,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen restated the provisions of section 107 of the Social Services Act in relation to which the plaintiff’s claim was lodged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After canvassing the argument that had been put to him in this case,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said in his judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I bring those facts forward I am bringing them forward as part of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen because it was he who referred to the fact that she had not achieved eligibility in those terms prior to seeking litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said quite accurately, in the final paragraph: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen was not prepared to give any declaration that the benefit was payable during that period and indeed the matter is still being determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again I remind the Senate that in his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen said that Karen Green was not entitled to a declaration that she was entitled, in respect of any period before 22 February, to receive unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what  Senator Grimes  should do-it might pay all of us to do this- is to examine the declarations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we have heard much from the Opposition in recent weeks about this matter, I do not think it yet understands the terms of the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether the declarations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen are incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber are concerned to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done to all applicants for government benefits in terms of the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this situation  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen indicated that there was some difficulty about the word ‘unemployed’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it has imposed unduly at times on Canada and Australia, but let us hope that in the light of the support of the unions I have enumerated <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done to those people across the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude my answer by saying that, if the judgment from the High Court is read accurately, it will be seen that it was acknowledged by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen that a decision needed to be made by the Director-General and a determination needed to be made by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals were developed out of the Government’s consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the independent inquiry into repatriation conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose of the New South Wales Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose recommended that repatriation boards should be abolished and replaced by a system whereby the initial determination of claims should be the responsibility of the Commission exercising its powers through suitably qualified persons acting individually as delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose recommended that, if repatriation boards were retained, the members when appointed should be subjected to an intensive training program before making determinations, rotation of board chairmen and members should be actively pursued, and the boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, the Government had adopted the recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that there should be arrangements for rotation of chairmen and members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also considered the view expressed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of these provisions is to obtain better co-ordination among boards, to ensure the attainment of a high standard by boards in the discharge of their duties, as suggested by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, but without reducing the independence of each board in the exercise of its determining power under the Act in respect of individual cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose had the following to say in this regard:  1  am satisfied on the evidence that for many cases in the past claims have been presented in an inadequate fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose came to the conclusion that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has accepted  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose ‘s conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose reported that there was before his inquiry a considerable amount of evidence that the present section 47 had caused much dissatisfaction and frustration and he concluded that the present provisions of section 47 have proved most unsatisfactory and should be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the repeal of the present section 47 and for the insertion in its place of a much simpler section which will provide that determining authorities: Are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and shall act according to substantial <span class="highlight">justice</span>, taking into account any difficulty that for any reason may lie in the way of ascertaining the existence of any fact, cause or circumstance, including such reasons as the effects of the passage of time and the absence of or deficiency in any official records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee drew attention to payments to a former <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia for unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and to the payment to a chief judge of the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset, I mention that when  Senator Rae  presented the report of Senate Estimates Committee F on Tuesday, he drew attention to an amount of $50,000 that had been paid in lieu of long service leave and unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> paid to a former <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court and to a further amount of $40,000 which was paid to the former Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes the amount paid to the former <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court or the amount paid to the former Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court look like chicken feed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real question now arises as to the stance members of the Opposition should take to the passing of this large sum of money for the Department of Social Security if the Department is to continue to refuse to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the interpretation of the Minister about the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these estimates which cover additional amounts for the year ending 30 June 1977 no provision is made for an expenditure for unemployment benefits for anyone who may succeed in an application following  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the effect of what the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said was that the Director-General of the Department of Social Security had no power to issue a blanket order, that he had to deal with every case individually and had to make a decision on every application that came before him as to whether it met the criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no provision is made we must consider recommending that provision should be made in these estimates for the payment of benefits to these children who I think can meet the criteria and will have to be paid in accordance with <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Stephen ‘s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased and interested to hear that the Director-General of Social Services will be making public his decision on his deliberations on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen ‘s ruling in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should be especially concerned because Timor is our neighbour, and I am sure the Indonesian Government would want to know if these crimes have been committed so they could bring the perpetrators to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned about this and wonder whether it indicates that the Government has made up its mind that there shall be no payment to school leavers for this period, despite the interpretation that might be placed upon the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give some assurance that if there has to be a review of those applications the review will be dealt with speedily and <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done to those school children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted the April edition of the Returned Services League  National News Digest  which reports on a meeting by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose with the RSL National Executive in March? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Digest  in referring to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, in his report which was tabled in Parliament on 19 February 1976, advocated that legal representation should be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see <span class="highlight">justice</span> done and I know that  Senator Wright  does too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Isaacs  later became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Isaacs and  Sir Isaac  Isaacs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Division 170 relates to salaries and payments in the nature of salary in lieu of long leave and unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter disturbed members of the Committee in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan, and that was the amount that was paid to him- a neat $50,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On examination of the various officials who were acquainted with the facts it emerged that the way the sum of $50,000 was computed was to allow a yearly salary of $47,500 and to add to that an amount to compensate  Sir Edward  McTiernan for the periods in which he acted as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the absence of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I am not suggesting there is anything improper in it and I am not suggesting that a puisne judge who acts as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is not entitled to some compensation for the added responsibility involved, it was sloppy and a careless way of going about such a task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expressed in the particulars of proposed additional expenditure as ‘payments in lieu of long leave and unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who retired 2 years ago,  Sir Richard  Kirby, by a mere gratuitous act of the Executive, was given twice the annual salary just as an act of grace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember a distinguished chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court who, in practice, in 1921, by tradition having performed notable national service for the Wool Board had delivered to him a cheque for 10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen is well known to members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many matters were referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen in his judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it no person in any part of the Government had anything to do with the report until it was released by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware- I will check this matter for the honourable senator- until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox gave the report to the 2 Ministers concerned, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development, no other person in the Government had a copy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Royal Commissioner on Security and Intelligence,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, who was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in August 1974, has recently completed a most extensive series of investigations and reports on all aspects of Australian intelligence and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were the original terms of reference for the inquiry into the intelligence and security services of the Australian Government such that they would enable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to investigate also foreign intelligence services in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that when the Kerr Committee reported in August 1971 it consisted of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr, as he then was,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mason,  Mr Ellicott,  the present Attorney-General, and Professor Whitmore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is poetic <span class="highlight">justice</span> that so many of the large developers themselves have been caught up in the same exploitative trap as they set for others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia will be able to achieve the <span class="highlight">justice</span> which has been denied to it for all these years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  announced today that  His Excellency  the Governor-General had, on the advice of the Executive Council, appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as a Royal Commissioner to inquire into Australia’s intelligence and security services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of a Judge with qualifications as eminent as those of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope guaranteed that the inquiry would be well conducted, comprehensive and responsible and at the same time would reassure those countries and organisations with which Australia has connections in the security field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam said he wished to express his own thanks, and those of the Government, to the Premier, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Attorney-General of New South Wales for their courtesy; and co-operation in agreeing that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope should be available to undertake this important inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The changes have arisen largely from the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose on the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We agree with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his claim that the new section will clarify the whole situation and will give the applicants the idea that they are in fact getting <span class="highlight">justice</span>, more so than they do now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the original terms of reference of the royal commission into the intelligence and security services of the Australian Government were confined to the Australian services and as the Minister himself said yesterday in reply to my question that the royal commission had stayed strictly within the original terms of reference, I ask: How could the Prime Minister say in his Press statement of 24 May 1977 entitled ‘Allegations of CIA Activities in Australia’ that the investigations of the royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, covered activities of foreign intelligence services in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what I suggest were adopted this Parliament could be restored to the supremacy that people think it should have and we would have an ordered community which would conduce to the <span class="highlight">justice</span> and prosperity of trade unionists and employers and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop,  to do him <span class="highlight">justice</span>, said that all these things should be done by consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to take a little further this concept of even-handed <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want the arbitration system to represent the whole of the spectrum of the judiciary we need men like  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples often has unorthodox ideas, but he has always been a kind and understanding man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no secret that at times he has Utopian ideas, but he is a fair man and he is seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is good enough to tell the trade union movement that Bill Smith is a good union official or that he should not be a union official, it is good enough to refer to members of the Bench and say, for example, that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Staples has his virtues and ask what his future will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We talk about <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in their union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person who goes before a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has to abide by the decision given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> must be done to organisations as well as to individuals, but the Government believes that the way in which it has gone about it in providing a defence to an organisation- that it takes reasonable steps to prevent the conduct from occurring- is fair and it would have to be decided on the facts of every case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not say very much about proposed section  45D,  except that I believe that the refinement of it which finally has come into this legislation after much discussion and much controversy is desirable and necessary if we are to have fairness, equality and <span class="highlight">justice</span> before the law, which applies to employees as well as to employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been very difficult for the Minister to maintain the strength of the previous conditions and at the same time give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the commercial community which is laced with a number of organisations which quite properly should be able to merge or sell their operations to other concerns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard  Senator Missen  defend proposed section  45 d  of the Act on the basis that it provided <span class="highlight">justice</span> before the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me give an example of this so-called <span class="highlight">justice</span> before the law as it would be applied under proposed section  45D  (3) of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only in those cases in which there is a trade union or a labour council with efficient legal people to protect the workers is there <span class="highlight">justice</span> in compensation cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only way <span class="highlight">justice</span> was achieved there was through a secondary boycott. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission chaired a conference of the parties which resulted in a special redundancy program being introduced into the industry for a limited period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Conference was assisted in its consideration of this matter by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson and Commissioner Neil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think the way in which we are dealing with this group of Bills does <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the disease eradication Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of the matter is to some degree set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs  (Senator Durack)  and includes an outline of the various conferences and discussions which have taken place, particularly the important conferences under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combine that excerpt from the  Maritime Worker  and that condition that is stated in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby ‘s remarkable conference and you realise how near you are to solution when you have that possibility facing private employers in any set-up that may disband the authority and go to private employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in the Minister’s second reading speech  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to emphasise the fact that attempts have been made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson and  Sir Richard  Kirby to try to take the heat out of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the rumour has it that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  John Hale is to be appointed to head the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  John Hale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the common law procedures bedevil one from ever getting <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby,  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission, at the Commission ‘s recent hearings in Brisbane on Complaints Against Police, express disappointment that the Commonwealth Police Force had not presented a formal submission to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was reported by the media that at the Brisbane hearing of the Law Reform Commission on 4 May 1977,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby expressed disappointment that the Commonwealth Police Force had not presented a formal submission to the Commission on Complaints Against Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the alternative recommendations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in relation to the structure, and operation of Repatriation Boards was one of the matters dealt with in the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill which recently passed all stages in both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-145">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that the Royal Commissioner,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, has said that it would be very strange if the Federal Government refused to assist the commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He will also know that the overall study of the two reports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his Committee has been and remains a continuing study of the Federal Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that on 17 October 1975  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, in his written reasons for the decision in the case the Commonwealth v. the State of Queensland, referred to and quoted from a dispatch sent by the Governor-General to the Governor of Queensland concerning a petition to  Her  Majesty the Queen which had requested a reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are the problems which  Senator Mulvihill  and others have raised in the Senate from time to time in regard to the degree in which health care is effectively transmitted from various sources to the new settler in this country, the way in which he uses the legal services which are available to him and the way in which he can best express himself in the courts to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for himself and his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) and (3)1 have already announced that I will be making a statement to Parliament about the Government’s decisions on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations concerning the Australian Security Intelligence Organization  (Hansard,  24 May 1977, pages 1695-6). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that the Queensland <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Minister,  Mr Lickiss,  has publicly indicated that he favours a State takeover of the administration of the Family Court and the Australian Legal Aid Office: if so, (a) has the Queensland Government made a formal submission to the Commonwealth relating to either, or both, of these matters and, (b) have any other States indicated their views on either, or both, of these matters; if so, what are the details. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Canberra Times  carried some news in the form of a leak, it appeared, suggesting that the Government had entered into an arrangement with the defendants in a constitutional conspiracy case-  Mr Whitlam, Dr Cairns, Mr Connor  and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy- to the effect that the Government had agreed to pay the costs of the defendants in regard to those legal proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now have reason to believe that the solicitors for three of those involved and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, who was not represented by a solicitor in relation to this matter, have been informed of the Government’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney concerning the extortions taking place on the waterfront by the maritime unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney found that rip-offs, blackmail and skulduggery exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward thought that there was some justification for a buffer zone in order to ensure privacy for Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward selected 2 kilometres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this was pointed out to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, who was the tentative Commissioner, he said: ‘Yes, I agree with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That request had been founded, I think, on the view put forward by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward who considered the original request for a much wider area of the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, in the reasons for his decision quoted a letter from the Governor-General to the Governor of Queensland relating to advice given to  Her  Majesty The Queen by her Australian Ministers in the matter of a Petition seeking referral to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 30th January, 1974,  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral  (Sir Paul Hasluck)  sent a despatch to  His Excellency  the Governor of Tasmania  (Sir Stanley Burbury ) in identical terms to the letter referred to by His Honour Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy in the case which you mention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the original terms of reference of the Royal Commission into the Intelligence and Security Services of the Australian Government were confined to the Australian Services and as the Minister for Administrative Services said on 3 1 May 1 977, in reply to a question asked by  Senator Brown,  that the Royal Commission stayed strictly within the original terms of reference, how could the Prime Minister say in his press statement on 24 May 1977 that the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s, investigation included the activities of foreign intelligence services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the honourable senator makes an assumption about the terms of reference of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s inquiry which he will find would not be supported by study of the terms of reference taken as a whole which were incorporated in Hansard ( page 1 675 ) on 3 1 May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(a) Following  Mr Salemi  ‘s successful appeal against the initial decision by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs that his Statement of Claim should be struck out costs were awarded against the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me turn to the Fraser guidelines as I call them, guidelines which are far more stringent than those of any other country in the world, and far more stringent than  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox recommended in the first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox wanted the fullest possible public and parliamentary debate on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I guess it is pertinent to look back briefly on the first report and to see some of the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is these aspects that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has tried to come to grips with in his second report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we have to come to grips with the problems, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has indeed tried to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has tried to come to grips with this aspect also when looking at the situation in the Northera Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox found that the morale, employment, health and education of these people was at an extremely low level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox mentions this throughout his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox agreed that uranium mining would be highly profitable and that there would be benefits to the Australian shareholders and to the Australian citizens through the taxes that would be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox went on an overseas trip to look at some of the processing installations and at the manner in which power was being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one of his messages to the Prime Minister was totally distorted in a leak from the Prime Minister’s office which indicated that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox now totally supported uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has since been corrected by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have informed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, through one of the Commissioners, that I am deeply disturbed by the media speculation about his reports to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox found that under the procedures laid down in the Australian code of practice for the operation of uranium mines, radiation from mining and milling is not such as to justify a ban on uranium exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sufficient to say that the safeguards outlined by the Prime Minister on behalf of our Government went beyond those suggested by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In commenting on the amount of uranium available in this country,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, made this comment on page 39 of his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and  Sir Brian  Flowers both accept the safety involved in the reactor process as set out in what is known as the Rasmussen report as being adequate and appropriate at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  colleagues speak very highly of him and I feel that in drawing the attention of the Senate to his retirement we are doing a <span class="highlight">justice</span> to him that he has richly earned in his long, loyal and devoted service to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I am sure we all appreciate the fundamental principles of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and our democratic way of life in which Ministers of the Crown, including Attorneys-General, Commonwealth or State, are subject to the law of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is nowhere better expressed than in a recent decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sharp in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sharp went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know from the information that was given to the Senate this morning by  Senator Button  in relation to the case which came before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sharp that the question of standing down employees under the present Conciliation and Arbitration Commission Act is one which must be regulated by that Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Union leaders put it this way: They are there for the obtaining of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the adjournment debate we often hear about miscarriages of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight I outline what appears to me to be a gross miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which has been meted out to an Australian citizen because of what is nothing other than an illegal activity by an officer of the Commonwealth Employment Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not do this as a matter of course and I hesitate to ask the Minister to look at particular cases because I know the number of representations that must be made to her; but I thought that this was an important case in which there had been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and I asked her to investigate the case of John Smith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Rhodesian Parliament to Australia, to do what they have been deprived of doing previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia ‘s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the presiding Commissioner of the Ranger Inquiry,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, and to his fellow Commissioners,  Mr G.  G. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then I have appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as adviser to the Government on nuclear nonproliferation and safeguards matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part, I believe that the policy we have developed in this area is second to none and goes beyond the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the court in Parramatta was operating very successfully, with very little delay and with the achievement of early court action which very often stopped domestic disputes from becoming complicated affairs and prevented hardship and injustice which develop when there is delay and <span class="highlight">justice</span> is not done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important things which it was intended to achieve was a speedier form of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and an informal and less legalistic method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Pawley’s callover was held on 4 February 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the morning of 7 February 1977  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Goldstein held the first half of his call-over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the afternoon of 7 February 1977  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  RossJones held his call-over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hogan and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dovey are each having call-overs within the next week, and their lists are even longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hogan only has about 30 hearing dates left between now and the end of July by reason of expedited or part heard matters, so it is unlikely he will be able to fix many more than about 25 matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so despite the fact that a total of 30 Judges have been appointed to the Family Court so far, including  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Cook and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Yuill to the Sydney and Parramatta Registries since the date of your letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things happen more readily in a situation in which they cannot see <span class="highlight">justice</span> done, where they are told that they may have to wait a year or two, because they know that if children are in the hands of the wife for two years this must have a considerable influence on the decision of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court cannot help taking into account the fact that there is a stabilised situation, even though <span class="highlight">justice</span> has not been done, because the situation has been allowed to continue for some period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was defeated in the seat of Mount Gravatt later that year- from memory on 3 August- by the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I ask: With the termination of a certain case in the Canberra courts under <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Smithers which dealt with Australian Security Intelligence Organisation recruitment, are we likely to get some information on the recruitment methods, mindful of ASIO’s increased budget and some miscalculations regarding the personnel engaged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I refer the Minister to a partial promise he gave me some weeks ago that when the Prime Minister returned from Japan we might get a further edition of the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope report which was supposed to deal with an appeals tribunal for people denied citizenship, which could be related to ASIO evaluations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only question for the Court will be whether the action is lawful, in the sense that it is within the power conferred on the relevant Minister or official or body, that prescribed procedures have been followed and that general rules of law, such as conformity to the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, have been observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a travesty and what a mockery of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the underhanded methods used to bring alleged charges against TTLC Secretary Bob Watling and Peter Imlach, the denial to them of their rights and adequate notice, the breaches of ALP rules which have been perpetrated by the Rules Committee and the tribunal are so fundamentally opposed to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the good name of the Party as to require the firmest challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore call upon Bob Watling, particularly in view of the absence of Peter Imlach, to consider whether his appearance before such a tribunal would only aid the kangaroo court, bring discredit on the Labor Party which is committed tO <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the gut part of what I am talking about- wished to see the case against  Mr Whitlam, Dr Cairns,  the late  Mr Connor  and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to my amendment, I feel that it is vital at this point of time to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I knew you would stand up on the side of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the type of <span class="highlight">justice</span> we can expect from  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a report in the  Canberra Times  concerning the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common <span class="highlight">justice</span> and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference and so that the eventual impact on Australia’s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s leadership will ensure that Australia will contribute to the international fuel cycle evaluation to the maximum extent that its international position and technical expertise in nuclear matters will permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, with his background and experience in this field-so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality of the reports of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- has indicated that he is prepared to accept this task, a task which is most important for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with past practice where members of the judiciary have been appointed to executive offices- for example, the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward, when a judge of the Australian Industrial Court, to be DirectorGeneral of Security,  Sir Owen  Dixon, then a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to the United States and  Sir John  Latham, while Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to Japan- the Government proposes to introduce legislation to enable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also proposes to introduce legislation to increase the number of judges of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court from three to four to allow the Court to operate as necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour has advised me that, particularly having regard to the administrative nature of his duties as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and indeed the doubt that this assignment will be completed within a year, he proposes to resign as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult, after accumulating such a mass of conflicting facts and such a dialogue of error, to be able to come down with a report which would really give full <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the innocent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two matters arose out of the investigation by the Committee of the annual report of the Australian Law Reform Commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter referred to in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby ‘s annual report was the preparation of an Australasian digest of proposals for law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The progress on the digest proceeded until in the annual report of 1976  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby pointed out that the great bulk of the work on it had been completed and the manuscript was then awaiting publication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs wrote to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important findings of the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, was that Australia needs intelligence of quality, timeliness and relevance and that existing intelligence assessments do not meet these tests as well as they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a wage adjustment is not an appropriate method of doing equal <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the single person and the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This title is somewhat more verbose than the title suggested by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope which was at least more specific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation had its genesis in the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security presided over by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the somewhat filleted report which the Parliament has had available to it since April of this year there is a quite thorough historical analysis by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of what the expression ‘intelligence’ means, what it has meant in various contexts and the history of it, and quite a lot of esoteric references to expert opinion about the role of intelligence collection and the assessment of intelligence in the international scene generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for reasons like that that I find it refreshing to read in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report a reference to the need for Australia to maintain a degree of self-reliance in its international posture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made in relation to this matter is borne out by experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 42 of his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope again provided some degee of assurance to people concerned about the Australian intelligence community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in relation to both these areas that perhaps we should be a little more sceptical, a little more critical and a little more analytical in future about the sorts of assessments referred to in paragraph 45 of the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security when we are relying on information and views from what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope terms friends and allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Opposition is concerned, one of the things which seems to emerge about the Bill when one reads  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report is that compared with what  His  Honour recommends it is a pretty sloppy piece of legislation, either by intention, design or just by sheer misadventure at the hands of the draftsmen and the Ministers responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation departs from the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in one or two important particulars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of carrying out the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, as it is obviously spelt out, we have a Director-General placed in the bizarre position of hovering like a well trained waiter between tables one of which is occupied by experts in the assessment of intelligence from the departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence and the other occupied by the experts on the Economic Assessments Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not really see why we had to embark upon a title like that when the Americans and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found much simpler language or much more relevant language in which to describe the purpose of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps some people will argue with some of the provisions of the Bill, but I think the important thing is that we have a Bill before the Parliament which represents the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  says that the Bill does not represent the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why then does he support it and commend it if it does not represent  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s views? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either it does or it does not represent the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they should not come out with this wishy-washy nonsense of saying that it does and does not- represent the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope but we will commend it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has acted on the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope contained in a report which was commissioned- we give credit for this- by the former Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made a full inquiry into Australian intelligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Government has accepted, to a great extent, as we understand it, the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has acted quickly in accepting the major recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to a quote which  Mr Hamer  used in his speech from a report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated in his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if we recognise these factors the Bm despite some criticisms that can be made about certain of its provisions, in general follows very closely the recommendations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I suggest that a reading of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report immediately demonstrates that the Bill is not in complete agreement with his recommendations, even though the Bill does arise out of the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that is contrary to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found no need to split these boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, I do not believe the functions of the new Office are exactly what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the apparent exclusion of ASIO is contrary to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that we have to accept the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope or anyone else who brings a report to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the reasons for the existence of the Bill and the reason for the existence of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s commission of inquiry are what the previous Government saw to be the mistakes and deficiencies in our previous intelligence operations and certainly in our intelligence assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fact was recognised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report and it has been quoted by several people on both sides of Parliament in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in paragraph 40 of his report, said:   it would be naive to imagine that overseas governments will always tell us everything they know about a particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said, such a belief was naive and false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope confirm that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a bit disappointed with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s suggestion that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation should not be included in the ambit of this body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Assessments Board is probably the best we can achieve to advise the government of the day on how to apply the information- the processed information, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope says- in the interests of our national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that there is general acceptance of the basic findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is committed to bringing about what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope desired to be brought about, that is, to have an Office of National Assessments which will be effective and properly serve the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If your misunderstanding of this Bill is such that you think it has any relationship with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation then I am afraid you have neither read what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommended or the Bill before the Senate because they are two completely different operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be all right if the boards carry out  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s recommendations or carry out the promises made in the second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office may not act in accordance with the assurances given to us by the Minister, the assurances contained in the Minister’s second reading speech or even the recommendations contained in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister told us that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred to the appropriate authorities overseas and the Minister read from the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that according to the statistical research section of the Parliamentary Library inflation, as measured by aggregating quarterly changes in the consumer price index, was 13.9 per cent in September 1976 and is estimated to be 14.6 per cent in September 1977, based on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ‘s use of the consumer price index in his report on medical fees for medical benefit purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) When is the Government likely to implement the following recommendation from the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry Second Report (Fox Report): ‘That the guidelines developed by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Woodward for Aboriginal participation be applied to the planning and management of the whole of any national park, which is established in the region, even though part of it may not become Aboriginal land’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government took up almost all the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, and I see no reason whatsoever for a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the old regulations, appeals were made to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> or magistrate, whose decision was final. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me that is a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a travesty of democracy, which leads to the very thing about which churchmen in Queensland are protesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that they get <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that they should not have to pay for this momentous decision alone’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister seen the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  James Muirhead of the Northern Territory Supreme Court in the case of appeal by Nari Andy Jabaltjari. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem has been brought about by a combination of factors, the major one being that the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, has been occupied with the Ranger inquiry for a considerable period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan, the  President  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, who resides in Canberra, was expected to have more time available than he has had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister announced when the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as AmbassadoratLarge was made that his position on the Supreme Court would be filled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has now announced his intention of actually resigning from the Court, so there is no need to amend the Act to create a new position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, who has always given a good deal of his time to the Court and who was to have retired on 3 1 October 1977, has agreed to postpone his retirement until the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am grateful that he has been prepared to do so because it is not reasonable to expect that a judge to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox permanently will be found immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question I must decide is, I think, whether this debate is likely to interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having heard your arguments and your references in your point of order,  Senator Missen,  I am not satisfied, at this stage at any rate, that this matter will interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not inconsistent with fundamental rights and duties, the House should avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum or body of inquiry or permit its proceedings to interfere in the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart from particular matters such as criminal cases, court martials, civil cases and matters referred by a legislature to a judicial body, the rule has application to other hearings, inquiries or investigations in which the rights of individuals or a community group or the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have in Victoria a board of inquiry which the Premier of that State, upon hearing allegations that might suggest wrong doing on the part of government employees or others, appointed and placed under the chairmanship of a former judge of the Supreme Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gowans, a man of impeccable judgment and long respected in the Victorian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recommend to everyone to get away from making the cheap political speeches we hear, get out and meet the Aboriginal people and come back and discuss whether there is anything else we can do in a humanitarian way for the purpose of protecting and giving <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people whom we have robbed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24 September m the Johannesburg  Star,  which is a South African newspaper- Johannesburg is in South Africa, as  Senator Jessop  may know; I know he is an authority on the country but I do not know whether his knowledge is sufficiently deep to enable him to know that Johannesburg is in South Africa- in an article headed ‘Greeks speak out on Kruger’ it is reported that members of the Greek community in Johannesburg have protested against reported comments by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Kruger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, of the New South Wales Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking is reported to have said yesterday: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I had the benefit of a discussion with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams who,’ as honourable senators know, is a very distinguished member of the Queensland Supreme Court and who has been appointed by the Commonwealth Government as a royal commissioner into the problems of drugs in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it from my discussion with  His  Honour yesterday, proper means certainly will be put into motion whereby there will be total co-operation between his inquiry and that being run by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, arising out of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ desire, any complaints that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward might have will be dissipated quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the supervising scientist for the Alligator Rivers area in the field, and what sort of staff has he to achieve what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox visualises? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It consists of the Chief Judge of the Family Court, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Elizabeth Evatt,  Mr Lloyd  Phillips of the National Marriage Guidance Council,  Dr Jean  Martin, Senior Fellow in Sociology in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report suggests that the remuneration payable to justices and judges of Federal courts and of the Supreme Courts of the Territories and persons who have the same status as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> or judge of those courts, should be altered in accordance with the recommendations of the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Remuneration Tribunal reported that alterations were desirable in the remuneration and travelling allowances payable to judges, including those members of the judiciary who occupy quasi-judicial positions, such as the  Chairman  of the Prices Justification Tribunal, at that time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, the  President  and  Deputy  Presidents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal, the  President  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Director-General of Security,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, and the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Grants Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one peruses the report of the 1977 review of the Remuneration Tribunal it is interesting to observe that at the time the report was brought in the remuneration of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Queensland was greater than the salary payable to the Chief Justices of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of that report the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Queensland was $55,090 whereas the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia was $52,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, as recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal, is to be extended to $55,000, which is still less by some $90 than the figure appearing in the Tribunal’s report as at 31 May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So notwithstanding this legislation, we have a situation where the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia is in fact less than that payable to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the same situation applies on a lesser scale to salaries payable to justices of the High Court compared with those payable to justices of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and they are about the same as those payable to justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The salary of judges in five different tribunals is to be fixed at $44,000, and that is an acceptance of the principle of comparative wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> which has been set by wage-fixing tribunals for many years as a fair system for wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, where no such comparison can be made on the principle of comparable wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>, there should be an uplifting of salaries or a rearrangement of positions so that people doing like work receive like rewards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept for the judiciary the principle of comparable wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> which  Senator Douglas  McClelland has argued and which I think the Government accepts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have any spirit of <span class="highlight">justice</span> we should not blame the strikers for trying to get what the Government accepts as suitable; we should be blaming governments and the arbitration machinery for not giving them what we accept as fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators can see the lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that comparison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His political career and beliefs are based on a deep-seated hatred of trade unions and he is longing to throw into reverse all that the ALP and the union movement have fought for over decades to achieve wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and decent job conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These provisions are based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney- into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions conducted during the office of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Police in Western Australia had acted in the most deliberate attempt to pervert <span class="highlight">justice</span> after an incident involving Aborigines at Skull Creek, the Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister  (Mr Viner)  said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By any standards of conduct towards Aborigines or nonAborigines, this constitutes the most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>’,  Mr Viner  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By any standards of conduct towards Aboriginals or nonAboriginals, this constitutes the most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, evidence relating to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization was taken in camera at the direction of the Chief Magistrate in relation to the hearing conducted in the Court of Petty Sessions and subsequently at the direction of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers on appeal to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australians do have an enormous sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and they do not believe that people ought to be forced, against a genuine conscientious belief, to belong to something which they do not believe to be just. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-This is a great example of what might be termed trade union <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until the injustice which we are now prepared to recognise was rectified, there was rural revolt in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore they cannot receive comparable wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which everyone recognises they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the persons involved-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  DrakeBrockman of the Arbitration Court- is a relative of the  Deputy President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Drake-Brockman brought down a decision about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To his credit,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Drake-Brockman said: ‘I ought to have the Australian Gas Light Company directors before me because they prostituted the award I made’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are here to make laws on behalf of the people in such a way that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only is done but is seen to be done, and certainly in the circumstances that we see before us to-day generally throughout the community we have an understanding of the changing nature of industrial disputation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way this Parliament and this Government are reflecting the needs and the wishes of the community and are ensuring that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is how the people of Victoria feel about the workers in the Latrobe Valley and about the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite sit there and smirk because men have the guts to go without for 10 weeks and to demand some sort of wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With one or two exceptions honourable senators opposite fall into the categories of estate agents, businessmen, lawyers, company directors, graziers, doctors and so on, and they always join in unison the chorus attacking those who only want wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> and who have submitted themselves to the independent arbitration process to achieve some relative share of the wealth that is produced in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now suddenly, merely because this Government announces a continuation of the Whitlam Labor Government’s uranium policy- except that our policy provides better safeguards; except that we have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large to look after nonproliferation; except that generally it is a better policy- demonstrations are now occurring, demonstrations which have been whipped up by the Labor Party simply for mean political reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one senator who testified before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, I can endorse the rating that this statement gives to his extreme objectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw the same technique used against  Mr Snedden  in 1 975 over the blocking of the Budget; in late 1975 in regard to a change of mind falsely attributed just a few months ago to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox concerning the export of Australian uranium; and finally, of course, the speculation, which the Prime Minister has over the last four months fed, about a premature election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since then we have seen the former Liberal Party Attorney-General,  Sir Nigel  Bowen, appointed Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the new Federal Court of Australia; a former Liberal Party Minister,  Sir David  Fairbairn- one of the most undistinguished members of the Great Public School old boys association which has run this country for most of the last 25 years- appointed as Ambassador to the Hague; the former Tasmanian Liberal Party State Treasurer,  Mr Gunn,  appointed as a Commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission;  Sir Henry  Bland,  Mr Fraser  ‘s old mate, appointed as  Chairman  of the ABC until he could tolerate  Mr Fraser  ‘s interference no longer;  Sir Gordon  Freeth, a former Liberal Party Minister, appointed as High Commissioner to London; and Paul Gerber- one of the very few academics in Australia who was sufficiently willing to prostitute himself in 1975 that he backed the tactics used by the parties which are now governing Australia in blocking Supply- appointed to the Taxation Review Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What 1 have done in the Parliament of course and as Prime Minister, was to persuade  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to chair an enquiry . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no obligation in the memorandum of understanding for the Whitlam Labor Government to accept and adopt the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not only just given consideration to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox but in fact it has also adopted the vast majority of his recommendations, and in a number of areas it has gone further than the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the justices of the High Court will be as well aware as we are and everybody else is of the events that are about to take place and of the significance of them to the case before the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the circumstances I do believe that, whilst it might not be usual for an AttorneyGeneral to take any direct steps in regard to the giving of judgments by the High Court, I should make sure that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is aware of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and refers to the appointment of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Treyvaud to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further consideration is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Butler has been appointed as a Family Court judge resident in northern Tasmania, and that hitherto judges of the Family Court in Victoria from time to time rendered assistance in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, part of the arrangement made with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Butler is that, because he is not expected to be fully engaged in northern Tasmania, he will be available to travel to Victoria and assist there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill was foreshadowed in the statement to Parliament by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 6 October when he announced the Government’s decision to appoint  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In announcing that decision, the Prime Minister mentioned that the Government would be introducing legislation to enable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while he is Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox is at present the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and he is also a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with the legislative action that was taken to remove any doubts that the diplomatic appointments of  Sir John  Latham and  Sir Owen  Dixon in 1940 and 1942 respectively, and the appointment last year of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, may have had on their judicial offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that while  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is holding his appointment as Ambassador-at-Large he will retain his entitlements to remuneration and annual allowance that he would have had as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large comes to an end he will retain his position as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and he will be entitled to remuneration and annual allowances on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It only remains for me to endorse what the Prime Minister has already said about the importance which the Government attaches to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s proposed appointment as Ambassador-at-Large and to  His  Honour’s preeminent qualifications for the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He goes on strike only to get some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the people in the Latrobe Valley sought <span class="highlight">justice</span> and an uplifting of their income they were regarded as the worst people in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about <span class="highlight">justice</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> went out the window when this Government came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to ask a question of the Attorney-General which refers to the current work load of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court and action that is now being taken to resolve the position of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, the Chief Judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that the Prime Minister, in announcing the intended appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, indicated that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s inability to continue as a judge of the Supreme Court would mean that there would have to be a further appointment to that Court and an amendment of the Act to provide for a fourth judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that point, however, it was not quite clear whether  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox was going to resign from the Court or only from his position as Chief Judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was never the intention to appoint two more judges to replace  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has not yet resigned as Chief Judge and an appointment cannot be made to replace him because the Act does not provide for more than a Chief Judge and two judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, the resignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Chief Judge- and he now intends that to be a resignation from the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court- is a condition of any further appointment being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill enabling  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to be appointed as Ambassador-at-Large while still holding his office as a judge- despite his resignation from the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, he remains a judge of the Federal Court- is on the Senate Notice Paper today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the replacement of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is awaiting the passage of that legislation and his resignation as Chief Judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop reported to the Minister early in 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop ‘s report indicated that while all of the organisations and parties who made submissions to him agreed that the existing arrangements should not be allowed to continue, there was a sharp division between those who proposed that the Government should take a more direct role in the industry and those who believed the Government should seek to withdraw from its already limited regulatory role to enable the parties in the industry to assume more responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late last year, at the invitation of the Minister  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission brought the industry parties into conference to consider ways of meeting this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other major problems identified by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop were referred to the National Stevedoring Industry Conference which was convened under the Chairmanship of  Sir Richard  Kirby in December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved Industrial Relations:  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson and Commissioner Neil of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were involved with the National Stevedoring Industry Conference in considering ways of bringing about improvements in industrial relations in this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Robinson has since held aperies of conferences with the parties and agreement has now been reached in respect of persons nominated as port conciliators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reliably informed that this reform could be introduced by a rise of 0.7c in the price of petrol throughout Australia and would enable <span class="highlight">justice</span> to be restored to the people in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people are to be retained in the country areas of Australia, if production in the vast hinterland is to be maintained, some <span class="highlight">justice</span> is necessary for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  was prepared and anxious to mine and export uranium but after intensive investigation  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox could not guarantee that there was no danger to human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox said that the safeguards against nuclear weapons proliferation are inadequate at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have done in the Parliament of course and as Prime Minister, was to persuade  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to chair an inquiry . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government thereupon appointed two commissioners who were, I believe,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Clarkson, Visiting Lecturer of the University of Western Australia and  Mr Bridge,  who is now disputing the election results in the Kimberleys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In directing a question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources, I refer to the minute of the Department of Foreign Affairs, made public yesterday, of discussions held between  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and Foreign Affairs officials on 29 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the two facts that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has reported, namely, that there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian propositions that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by those countries without the specific approval of supplier countries and that there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer nuclear safeguards satisfactorily, how does the Australian Government intend to maintain the fictional assurances given to the Australian people that Australian safeguards will be met completely by overseas takers of our uranium exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is alleged to have said that ‘he believed that Australia had a responsibility to try to develop the concept’ and that ‘we were “clean skinned” and were now in a position to exert influence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted, if the document is accurate- we all expected it- because we are on all fours with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the document, referring to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simply stated purpose of the Bill is to provide certain machinery circumstances in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his appointment as AmbassadoratLarge for the Australian Government in relation to matters concerning nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear safeguards, and to provide for continuity of service in a judicial capacity for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox during the time he occupies the position of Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also proposes to introduce legislation to increase the number of Judges of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court from three to four to allow the Court to operate as necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the consequences of the activities of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in the past few months has been a substantial crisis situation for the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this is an opportune time to draw attention to the document which has already been discussed in the Senate this morning during Question Time in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s views of the international situation regarding nuclear safeguards and proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be any solution to the problems which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox suggests, in the statement made to the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, exists, we can only hope that he is successful in finding those solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have the highest regard for  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to enable the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia in its endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation regime, without this appointment impinging on his rights as a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, because of the importance of the office of Ambassador-at-Large upon the duties of which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox already has embarked, this Bill which puts at rest any doubt that this appointment can be made is a most important measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the negotiations for the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large the question of what ought to be done to replace him during the time that he would be absent from the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court was given very close consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court legislation had to be amended to increase the number of judges depended on the nature of the resignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and that was the only reason for the reference to increasing the size of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when it was clear that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox did not wish to remain a judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court but wished simply to remain a judge of the Federal Court, it then was not necessary to amend the Act because his resignation provides a vacancy for one additional judge whom it was intended to appoint anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passage of this Bill through the Senate will enable the resignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Chief Judge and as a judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court to take effect and the Government then will be in a position to proceed with the appointment of his replacement on that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright has criticised the way in which the salary and pension of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox are dealt with in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that in the Government’s view  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is making a considerable sacrifice in resigning as Chief Judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court in order to undertake this important task not only in Australia’s national interest but also in the international interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Bill provides that on the retirement of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox from judicial office his pension under the Judges Pensions Act will be calculated on the basis of the salary he would have received if at that time he had been Chief Judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court in addition to being a judge of the Federal Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The justification for that action is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, as Chief Judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court and a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, would have expected, in the ordinary course of events, to have continued in that office receiving the emoluments and status of that office as Chief Judge for the rest of his working life and in the exercise of his judicial functions for that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that does not answer the question I raised, that it makes  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s emoluments ambulatory, in particular in respect of clause 3 (b) of the Bill which refers to salary and allowances of the office of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> continuing during his appointment as Ambassadoratlarge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is a temporary appointment, the proposed appointee must decide whether the appointment is consistent with the retention of the office of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not consistent and the proposed appointee resigns from the office of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, then the lawful consequences should take place without exceptional provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by observing that, if my recollection is right,  Sir John  Latham was Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court and did not resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, he was not Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and he retained his office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointments of  Sir John  Latham and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon were of tremendous importance having regard to the gathering war clouds in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Sir John  Latham took up his duties and when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon went to the United States of America this country was in the darkest throes of one of the greatest struggles in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not allowed to express an opinion on the way in which the GovernorGeneral has carried out his duties, complete freedom and the right of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is taken away from every senator in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop and others have taken part in inquiries relating to problems in the stevedoring industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, when he considered this matter, seemed to come down with no very definite view on this question; rather, he posed the alternatives as, in a sense, I am doing again now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was announced by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  who fathered this scheme- or who adopted it, I should say, because the father of it is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After making a left hand remark about the Government having taken a whole year to get  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby to process the waterside workers’ proposals this gentleman said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, having great experience in the arbitration field, has scoffed at the idea, every time it was put up by a Liberal Minister, that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should have regard for economic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, having been given most favourable treatment on retirement in the form of a double serve of long service leave by  Mr Whitlam  ‘s personal decision- we were told here in answer to one of my questions that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby received a handshake of $62,000 when he quit the judicial bench- he immediately proceeded to organise the house for Labor in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With those antecedents I say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby ‘s structure of the foundation of this Bill gives me no confidence at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am criticising the presentation of this Bill and its formulation and shall show that this Bill should not be passed but should be referred to a select committee because one of the geniuses of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby was to shy-off from this elephant in the path- the factor that had given rise to this surplus labour, idle time and redundancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby accepted it and did not deter his colleagues from endorsing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the means adopted preparatory to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby ‘s conference, whereas the only proper approach to this problem should have been to try to get agreement upon those matters, solving them on ordinary decent principles consistent with general conditions in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby came on the scene- he has been described as a pragmatic personhe said: ‘Do not meet difficulties half way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it was quite acceptable to him, and subsequently to the Minister, to construct a scheme in replacement for the old weekly hiring “scheme put forward by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward which had been bedevilled by the absence of capacity to retrench or get rid of surplus employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were enunciated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, as he later became, but he did not advance a view as to which he preferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson who looked at the subject of accelerating redundancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop, as he now is, that would mean virtually that the Government would need to come in and nationalise the stevedoring industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to deal with the problems of the industry in the way in which  Senator Wright  believes it ought to deal with them, it does seem that that would be the only way in which the Government could exercise the authority suggested by  Senator Wright,  and apparently suggested by others to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop made it quite clear that the choice was between a more direct role for the Government and a withdrawal, as far as possible, by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That result has been achieved through the policies pursued by this Government, and in recent months through the negotiations that have gone on under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is where the genius of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr comes in for not revealing the full content of the gap in the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that  Senator Wright  has read  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore’s various reports on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some honest members on that side of the House, and I believe that if a case is made out they will vote on the principle of honesty and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Leader  (Mr Burns)  today lodged a complaint with the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Minister  (Mr Lickiss)  concerning yesterday’s election campaign statement in Mount Isa by the Premier  (Mr Bjelke-Petersen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ statement on the  This Day Tonight  program two nights ago in which he indicated that it was not his intention to allow  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to comment publicly on the findings of his recent overseas examination of world nuclear safeguards policy, despite the fact that there is a great deal of confusion over the Judge ‘s findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that the reluctance by the Foreign Affairs Minister to allow  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to speak directly to the Australian people on this crucial matter- a matter on which the people will be expected to vote in a few weeks time- is serving to confuse the uranium debate and hence cast more doubts by the Australian people about the Government’s policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the trouble is that those flat earthers who are opposed to the mining and export of uranium are a bit cranky because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is not saying the things they would like him to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: As legislation relating to the position of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox- I understand he is now Ambassador Fox-has been passed by the Parliament and, I understand, has been assented to, is the Attorney-General able to make any announcement concerning the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, particularly concerning a replacement for Ambassador Fox? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the passage through the Senate of legislation yesterday and its subsequent assent early yesterday evening by the Governor-General, I am pleased to announce the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and the appointment of  Mr Douglas  McGregor, Q.C., as a judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory as well as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn has been a judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court since 1971 and, prior to that was a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory from 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the absence of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox on the Ranger Uranium Evironmental Inquiry,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, as senior judge, has virtually been acting as the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said time and time again that Australia must go into the uranium business if, in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s words, we are going to be able to play our proper part in the world and stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the individual involved and am not that much concerned other than to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted the remarks of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey in his first report in accordance with the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, where he has stated that the Act is not as clear as it might be with regard to the proper construction to be given to section 50 (3) of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis,  Senator Ryan  and  Senator Wriedt  are trying once again to see that the decline goes on and that ordinary social <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall not prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the report of the Committee, the Committee assures honourable senators that it is both proper and desirable that old assumptions in the law of evidence can be and ought to be relaxed in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can remember a distinguished Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Queensland saying during a television interview that in Queensland vagrancy was considered a very serious crime; that therefore the police treated it very seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must emphasise that I am not one of those who believe that the warrantor system should be scrapped, but I would say that as an absolute minimum, any person who is to be warrantor for a number of homeless persons, pensioners or beneficiaries generally in the community, particularly those who act for a number, should be scrutinised regularly to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done to the warrantees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Steven of the High Court plainly agreed with the Opposition and if one needs further confirmation it lies in section 14 of the Bill: The Government has been forced to introduce legislation to deprive school leavers of unemployment benefits for that six-week period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also concerned at the Government’s failure to note almost all of the recommendations which have come out on unemployment benefits- - namely, in the Myers report, the reports of Professor Henderson, the poverty inquiry and others- that if you abolish payment in advance, replacing it by payment in arrears, in order to have <span class="highlight">justice</span> you must also abolish the seven-day waiting period which presently applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then would have true <span class="highlight">justice</span> and true reform, instead of this piecemeal approach which is being used as a means of cutting down expenditure on social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this legislation, as well as the decision given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen in the High Court, vindicates the attitude taken by the Opposition at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to note that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  does not believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stevens in any way upheld that view in his judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My only comment on that is that if  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stevens did not uphold that view I fail to see the necessity for the introduction of this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in our view and in the view of all commentators on the subject,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stevens did uphold that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the clause is legalising something which the Government did illegally to school leavers last year, although it has claimed that it was within its rights in doing what it did and has maintained by inference that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen upheld its actions,  Senator Grimes  has pointed out that if what the Government did to school leavers last year was legal there is no reason to have this clause placed in the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> must not only be done but also it must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People involved in industry, the <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Broadcasting groups, have called it bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This criticism of the Bill has been made by an organisation to which one honourable senator opposite referred, the organisation called <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it not be thought that the organisation <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Broadcasting is some wild, radical and revolutionary organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the other hand, I think that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the criticism that has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> was done by a much better Attorney-General in Tom Hughes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we pointed out at the time of its introduction that if the family allowance were introduced in this way and if tax rebates for children were abolished, if <span class="highlight">justice</span> was to be maintained, it was essential that that family allowance should be regularly upgraded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same recommendation Professor Henderson recommended that the supporting mothers’ benefit should be a Commonwealth responsibility, and that to maintain <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the community home care help, infant welfare, child care and general accommodation services for women in distress and children in distress should be upgraded and should be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister’s ability to read such statements effectively did it more than <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if there are two sides before this quasi-judicial body, the Tribunal has to decide what should be the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the situation in regard to those opposing sides- one representing a proprietary interest and the other, one would think, representing a public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) Is the Prime Minister aware that on 17 October 1975  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, in his written reasons for the decision in the case,  The Commonwealth  v.  The State of Queensland,  referred to and quoted from a dispatch sent by the Governor-General General to the Governor of Queensland concerning a petition to Her Majesty the Queen which had requested a reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the honourable senator to the answer to question 2 above and to the advice to  Her  Majesty by  Her  Australian Ministers as set out in the letter contained in the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will the Australian Government ensure that Aus.tralian safeguards will be completely met by overseas takers of our uranium exports, in view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s report of 29 September 1977, recorded in a Foreign Affairs Departmental minute made public on 2 November 1977, that: (a) there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian proposition that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by these countries without the specific approval of supplier countries; and (b) there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer safeguards satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I adhere to the longstanding rule endorsed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope that in general the Government will not answer questions in relation to security and the activities of its security organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his report, indicated that in his opinion it was a proper relationship but it was one that should be formalised between governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated during a hearing before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams in Launceston last week that the media had created the impression that the taking of drugs was so common that it was thought to be fashionable and the thing to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I find extraordinary about the inclusion of this suggestion in the GovernorGeneral ‘s Speech of the setting up of an inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen to look into this matter is that in many senses it is an insult to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that at the time of his appointment to the position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia from this Parliament some years ago- that, of course, is not jobs for the boys, any more than  Sir John  Spicer’s appointment was or  Sir Nigel  Bowen’s appointment was-  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in justification of his appointment, made a point that I think has some validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government had no alternative other than to dismiss  Mr Salisbury  because  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White ‘s report disclosed that the Special Branch of the South Australian Police Force was not a collector of security material; it was a collector for the Liberal Party of information about the Australian Labor Party members and trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The source of information for the Liberal Party was threatened with destruction as a result of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three distinguished Australian citizens- <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt, an archbishop of my own church, and a leading public figure- spent a long time preparing the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until you can get some <span class="highlight">justice</span> let them do it all themselves and let them pay your husband the sort of wage that will cover the needs of you and your family without you being sold into slavery all your life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade unions, governments, and employers have let one man’s wage drift so far back that it will no longer keep a wife and family and so we have the family income made up of two people’s wages, and in my opinion one of those people gets less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government is involved in a major review of the laws relating to security in this country as a result of the royal commission inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope which was set up by the Labor Government, of which  Senator Mulvihill  was a supporter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope reported to this Government, and the Government has accepted his report, part of which will involve amendments to legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope made major recommendations about the reform of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, but he also made some recommendations about the establishment of a security appeals tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time-honoured practice of Ministers responsible for security not answering questions in the Parliament on the matter was affirmed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has considered and accepted the basic conclusions of the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on intelligence and security, and is acting to ensure his conclusions are put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to be able to advise the House that the Premier of New South Wales has agreed to make  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope available to carry out this review, and I thank him for his prompt cooperation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, however, concluded that a review conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope would be the most effective and appropriate way to proceed, and that the terms of the review embrace the very proper concerns of the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope will be empowered to take a fully comprehensive review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the broad areas which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will examine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of any legislation as a result of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s review will, of course, present the opportunity for Parliamentary examination of the relevant issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review to be undertaken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope does not detract in any way from this responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall in this context the statement in the Rockefeller reports on the Central Intelligence Agency quoted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his fourth report on intelligence and security: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to the people in the industry in Victoria who are being disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Government in framing its next Budget will give earnest consideration to introducing some initiatives which would give a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to country telephone subscribers, perhaps along the lines proposed in the fuel equalisation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest there is a true parallel between the two, but that is the type of relief which is required to give some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to country subscribers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When will the Minister authorise the installation of air-conditioning in Commonwealth vehicles in the interests of public health and safety and to provide elementary <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Commonwealth drivers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will be aware that the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission, under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, has been considering reform of the law of defamation and the desirability of introducing legislation specifically creating legally enforceable rights to privacy in certain areas of human behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not being critical in saying that because industrial matters were dealt with by people such as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Taylor, who was an extremely competent conciliator, and  Sir William  Hudson, who was a good administrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised with him- I think it was one of those occasions when he was ducking and weaving on the ropes- the subject of the way in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers was able to obtain information about the calibre of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation operatives and their recruitmenttheir immaturity was under consideration in this case- that had been denied to the elected members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This morning the Attorney-General took refuge in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, indicating that it did not go that far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, I spent about 45 minutes making submissions to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope concerning certain injustices among some ethnic people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that point because, obviously, the expenditure on security that the Prime Minister plans- and I am not at this time cavilling at that- is such that we are entitled to such information as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them were legitimate, but one of the complaints they made was that they came before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Berry who was an Englishman himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox said that we should export uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers of my Department who are concerned with this Bill have been particularly concerned with the implementation of the Government’s decisions in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report on security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, equity and the capacity of citizens, whatever their economic circumstances, to seek redress in the courts, in general we are opposed to the imposition of court fees and, more specifically, to the reintroduction of court fees through legislation of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view it is proper that those litigants who can afford it should make some payment towards the general  cost  of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Parliament two days ago, I drew attention to  Sir John’s  long and notable career of public service, and to the fact that both as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and as Governor-General, he would have been able to devote more of his life to serving Australia had not most unusual events intervened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I am a New South Welshman it is to be hoped that the Premier of our State,  Mr Wran,  will recognise now, that he is confronted with estate duty abolition to the north and to the south of his State and also in the Federal scene, that to save jobs and to pass on <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the people of New South Wales he too must see fit to abolish that duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once I had made up my mind, for my own part, what I must do if  Mr Whitlam  persisted in his stated intentions,I contacted the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The achievements of the boilermaker’s son from Balmain who became Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and eventually GovernorGeneral certainly speak for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, it does not, but <span class="highlight">justice</span> does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> was done to them, so why cannot <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done to people like Bill Wood? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, the conflict between departmental convenience and the imperative that <span class="highlight">justice</span> both be done and be seen to be done became clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided that this question should be one of the matters expressly referred to the inquiry on conflicts between public duty and private interests, which is about to be undertaken by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Bowen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With some of those complex matters I go to various lengths to try to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common <span class="highlight">justice</span> and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia ‘s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Attorney-General that even if the facts were not identical, even if they were fairly substantially different, if it appeared that certificates were being issued in the case of an incursion into one country within the meaning of the Act but were not being issued in the case of an incursion into another country, considerable disquiet about political interference with the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> could result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Attorney-General relates to references that I made in my remarks on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General’s Speech concerning disclosures in the case before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers about immature people being recruited as Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General: In view of the information that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers obtained, are we to infer that senators are not regarded as adequate security risks, and cannot have that information, or may the committee that he well knows I have eulogised in my remarks have access to the transcript of that case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and responsible officers of ASIO would have anything to do with an incident like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in organisations such as ASIO whom  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has described as immature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Senate to the report of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White relating to Special Branch security records in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next classification  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White went on to deal with that category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case of South Australia and the observations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope about State Special Branches make it clear that a drastic overhaul of the systems will be needed to protect civil liberties, to place police intelligence activities firmly under the guidance and control of elected political authorities, and to give people who have been the subjects of security reports access to these reports and the means to appeal against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A summary of the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in relation to that Organisation was that it could not keep even a filing system but was keeping files on all sorts of people, as has been revealed in South Australia, without being able to operate a filing system in even the most elementary way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our friend  Senator Button  mentioned Acting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White who was given a clear set of terms of reference as to how he should go into this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conservationists have distinct reservations even about the Alligator River in the Northern Territory because, even accepting the question of the Ranger Mine, we notice that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox suggests that development take place in a number of stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he has studied further the suggestions that I made during the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of the Governor-General when I contrasted the accessibility of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s recruitment procedures to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers and to this Parliament which, although it authorises the expenditure, has no such information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third opportunity reads:  to direct and co-ordinate education in criminology, especially in relation to the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> services; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the judges and magistrates who deal with the people who are ultimately brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>- of course, they do not all get caught- would agree that one can trace in a number of the cases which do come before the courts some connection between the drug scene and the people who are ultimately convicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time, when in the criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system world, Australia was an outside country with only peripheral contact with the famous centres of study and learning in the criminal sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Institute continues to maintain a close interest in the establishment of uniform crime and criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> statistics for the whole of Australia and has continued to work closely with the Australian Bureau of Statistics to achieve this goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major research projects cover a wide field: The position of police unions and their impact on police administration; juvenile <span class="highlight">justice</span>; and white collar crime, which I have mentioned already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Institute ‘s activities cover such diverse aspects as a seminar of prison psychologists, the role of the police in juvenile delinquency and criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> research methodology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total cost of crime and criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> services in Australia was estimated to be at least $ 1,000m last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should appreciate what is said on just one page I have open before me in a volume called  Crime and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Australia  edited by David Biles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is by this exercise of discretion that police forces, and indeed criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> generally, are to a significant degree judged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was puzzling for me to be there for the first time and see that the magistrates court was not in a sense a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, a place of neutrality where the rights of the person arrested or charged were protected by the prosecutor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the element of <span class="highlight">justice</span> simply vanishes when the convenience of the prosecutor is put before the convenience of the alleged offender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have an enlightened system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country- I believe that the work of this Institute may be leading to that objective- we must do all those things which ensure that the offender’s rights are in no way jeopardised, even if that may result in a guilty person escaping <span class="highlight">justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially there was a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making this request I am suggesting not that the Government should appear to be unduly interfering in the internal affairs of another country or reflecting on the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that country, nor that former Prime Ministers should have some preferential treatment, but that the Government should point out that the execution of a former head of government by a government composed of his political opponents would have at least the appearance of being a somewhat barbarous act which would make it rather difficult in future to conduct civilised relations with the Government of Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, has recently paid several visits to the historic homestead of Lanyon in the Australian Capital Territory which has been gazetted on the register of the Australian Heritage Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were the visits of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to Lanyon occasioned by his desire to have this mansion allocated by the Government for occupancy by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> when the High Court is established permanently in Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to gratify this wish of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in visiting Lanyon is a matter for response by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> himself if he so desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has been enormously interested in the Australian Heritage Commission and the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will action be effected to ensure that all children can be treated with equal <span class="highlight">justice</span> by the Courts and that other deficiencies arising in Family Law legislation through recent decisions of the High Court can be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh has moved an amendment, not opposing the passage of the Bill but expressing an opinion as to its inadequacy and shortcomings when considered in the light of the coalition parties’ election promise and also in the light of reports received on the petroleum industry in this country, such as the report of the Royal Commission into Petroleum conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It surprises me and it is always unusual to see a Bill such as this introduced by a Government whose members and supporters continually harp on the importance of free markets and allowing market forces to hold sway so that we will all get <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum- the report by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Collins- made no bones about its conclusions in regard to what it thought of the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Collins says in paragraph 31.1 on page 32 1 of the report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Collins finally sums up the situation by saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins goes into great detail further on in his report about the manner in which the market has been manipulated, torn about, jumped upon and everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That situation is confusing not only to <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Collins but also to everyone else in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioner calls for administrative and pricing policies to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that that situation exists, legislation is now being introduced to affect an industry about which we know little, which is notorious for its secrecy, and whose marketing and retailing system, in the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins, is ‘just a mess’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be supplied by those same oil companies which, according to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins in his Royal Commission report, are notorious for their practice of cross subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its practices are irrational and secretive, as <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Collins said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I support the States Grants (Petroleum Products) Bill which, despite what has been said by  Senator Walsh  and  Senator Grimes  of the Opposition, restores a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people who live outside the capital cities of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would not be doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people who represent that State in the Parliament if one did not concede that there are freight problems, apart altogether from the matter covered by this Bill, which are apparent in relation to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have indicated already that this Bill will restore to producers in the country areas of Australia a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which was denied them during the three years of Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the legislation as a redemption of the Government’s election promise and a worthwhile initiative to return a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the rural community of which it was deprived by the Labor Government during its term of office from 1972 to 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a first step to implement the election policy of the Prime Minister and I look forward to the day, with some optimism, when there will be complete <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people in isolated areas of Australia, so that they will pay no more for their petrol than do their counterparts in the capital cities of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard  Senator Tehan  make the remark that this Bill restores a measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span>; also, that it fulfils an election promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Did <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Elizabeth Evatt hold talks in Brisbane with the six judges of the Family Court bench of Queensland last Friday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the full reasons for a visit to Brisbane by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt last week to which  Senator Colston  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This strategy appears closely similar to the ‘Land Rights’ philosophies conceived through a commission given  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralisation and return to home lands pre-dated  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s commission by a decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, we are appalled at the innuendoes, the distortions and the obvious blatant attempts to discredit the Church apparently because we have stood strongly for truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Aboriginal affairs in your State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May 1970 they commenced an action in the Northern Territory Supreme Court against Nabalco and in April 1971  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn gave his decision on the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, it would not have been in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to make such a report available at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would also assist the introduction of legislation to make provision for carrying out our Party’s policy and the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward; that is, the provision of proper land rights for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision seems to us to ignore completely the vital recommendations that were made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report in which he dealt so eloquently with the problems of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the  Chairman  of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, said in his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I think this should be placed on record: It was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s specific recommendation in his second report that titles should not be vested in community councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and my own Department are also observing closely the progress being made in South Australia by the Committee of Inquiry headed by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Bright, which is presently examining the rights of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not carry out what the Opposition intended by its policy and that was to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people living in semi-remote and remote areas in the price of fuel, particularly petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that regardless of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interjection I made was that this point was not supported by the fourth report of the Royal Commission into Petroleum, chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Collins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is recognised, as to me the Bill certainly underlines, the contribution for a similar period by the divorced spouse must also in terms of <span class="highlight">justice</span> be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, when we became aware of the investigations leading up to the present situation and of the possible scale of the alleged offences, we co-operated to ensure that the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> was not interfered with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I wish to raise, which also concerns the community involved, deals with the question of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for those migrants who in future may surfer from such disorders, or in fact from any disorders that may entitle them to sickness or invalid pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity given to the case requires that a clear explanation of the events is given not only to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to both the taxpayer and the individual migrant but also to assist the community in understanding the difficulties which the Greek community is having in the present case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement of that policy was made only after long and careful consideration by the Government of the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry conducted under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as presiding Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, Australia’s AmbassadoratLarge on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Safeguards, is fully engaged in Australia’s effort at INFCE. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it not be forgotten that these are the radical feminists who are the real enemies of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the vast majority of women, women who are working in the home doing the most important job in the world, raising future citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether it will be possible for the Australian Government to fund a case on behalf of Aborigines and their title to land rights in Queensland to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can come to the conclusion only that the Aborigines of Queensland have been betrayed as a result of this agreement which can only be described as infamous and denying <span class="highlight">justice</span> at the very point in time when we felt that the principles of self-management were going to be applied, in the first instance to Mornington Island and Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be doing less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Minister if I did not at this stage congratulate him publicly on ensuring that those suggestions were carried forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember what was said by the then  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, the leading <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Communist Party dissolution case, when he struck down an arbitrary Bill that did this Parliament no credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I supported that Bill, with my inadequate understanding, but I never supported it again after I received the enlightenment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, who said that history, and not only ancient history, shows that when democratic institutions have been superseded they have been superseded not seldom from within. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the advice of a conference presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson at first and then the Ministerforsaking the advice of his colleagues and preferring the advice of  Sir Richard  Kirby, who was paid upwards of $6,000 at the rate of $125 a day- was misled, I believe, into the situation of accepting an extravagant program of redundancy payments, the like of which ought to shock the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the review of protective security to be undertaken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will include a review of the relationship between State, Territorial and Commonwealth police and in view of the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is presently calling for public submissions, may we assume that the Government will make no decision on the Mark report until the second Hope report has been presented and made public? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the inquiry upon which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is about to embark will affect some aspects of the Mark report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it may be true that some aspects cannot be resolved until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report is before the Government, it may well be that some areas can be resolved before then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The damage to community relations and the reputation of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> resulting from the conduct of the authorities in the alleged social security frauds in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for several reasons that I raise this matter of public importance, namely, the damage to the community relations and the reputation of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> resulting from the conduct of the authorities in the alleged social security frauds in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there is a section of the community which is concerned that it has been treated in a discriminatory manner and has not received <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the sense that it has been accused of being guilty rather than presumed to be innocent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition knew there would be investigations and we on this side avoided comment because we did not want to interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters of concern do not come under the heading of matters sub judice and I believe they should be answered in this Parliament, because it is important that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is seen to be done, that hardship is not occurring and that the situation of people not born in Australia being treated as secondclass citizens should not be created or, if already created, should be eradicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with a group of people many of whom do not have a good knowledge of English and who have very little knowledge of our social security system and our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they came to this country they were told that we have a British system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which believes that people are innocent until they are proven guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes has introduced this matter of public importance in which he has stated that he is concerned at the damage to community relations and the reputation of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> resulting from the conduct of the authorities in the alleged social security frauds in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  motion refers to our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should be aware that that is our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  preferred to call it a scandal and preferred to say that people are considered to be guilty until proven innocent, but in doing so he is disregarding the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  pointed out that under our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> no one is in fact guilty until he is so proven in a court of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to be quite an inadequate answer to the situation as we know that in Australia one is not only tried in the courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> but also tried in the kangaroo court of the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The damage to community relations and the reputation of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> resulting from the conduct of the authorities in the alleged social security frauds in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fairly wide and ill-defined statement and I will attempt to examine it more closely to see whether what is implied by the Opposition is true or whether damage to community relations and to our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the conduct of authorities are important, necessary and basic things that are being handled extremely well by the Government and by the appropriate departments in the situation which has prompted the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, anything which damages community relations and our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this democracy is a matter of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything that is a negative contribution to an economy in which people who are striving hard and successfully against problems of inflation and unemployment and in the fight to re-establish that which we need perhaps more than anything else- a sense of national pride and a knowledge that initiative will be rewarded and <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be seen to be done is to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The alleged damage to community relations and the reputation of our system of” <span class="highlight">justice</span> should turn to a measure of relief for Australians when they see what is happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility of a government and I would hope, of, an opposition is to see that the people who are responsible for perpetrating a crime, no matter who they are or what they are, are brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, damage to community relations and the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> are matters requiring urgent attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is running to earth the guilty parties, perhaps slowly but surely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is genuinely attempting to find those who are guilty of defrauding the Department and consequently the great mass of Australian people, to run them to earth and treat them as <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are confronted with a position where <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only has to be done but also must appear to be done in respect of the conflict that obviously exists between these two companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace on 26 April at the height of the worst part of the Aurukun disputealthough probably the worst part is now- issued a Press statement, which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a letter to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Ian  Viner, the  Chairman  of the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, Bishop W.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along similar procedural lines, the Bill also contains provisions to extend to the Aboriginal Land Commissioner the same protection and immunity as a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard, it is apparent that in certain aspects of the amending legislation the Government is saying that the promotion of the processing, mining and exporting of uranium should take precedence over <span class="highlight">justice</span>, land rights and the very principles of self-determination for the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extension is made subject to a number of conditions which follow the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox recommended that the land should go to the Aborigines subject to a lease to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I do think that that passage of  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s speech did the Government rather less than <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does them, their organisation and the mining industry less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to have arguments put forward in that form in the name of the Australian Mining Industry Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, established by the Whitlam Government in 1975, of which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox was appointed  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker conducted an inquiry into the reprocessing of uranium in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 70, paragraph 13.3, of the Windscale report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker states:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote again from the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker on Windscale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could go on and give more examples, which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker has given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear on the basis of what he has said that he has not read the conclusions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox would not have felt the need to utter any warnings about the development of uranium mining in Australia if he had had the benefit of  Senator Collard  ‘s views on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox which  Senator Collard  clearly has not read or has disposed of in his mind as being a totally irrelevant document- stated that the Atomic Energy Act 1953 should not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that, in spite of that injunction from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, the Government wants to continue to use the Atomic Energy Act for two specific reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was tempted this evening to make a speech in the adjournment debate in praise of Queensland <span class="highlight">justice</span>, in view of the fact that the Opposition Whip,  Senator Georges,  has returned to us unharmed and ungaoled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement of that policy was made only after long and careful consideration by the Government of the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry conducted under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as presiding commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to indicate that the Commonwealth does not accept the interpretation of that statement in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as to the unqualified power of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been tremendous debate on the matter, there have been the reports by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and there has been constant discussion on how and when we will commence developing uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is therefore necessary we feel that in each case Courts bc appointed at which summary matters may be dealt with in a similar fashion in respect of which Aboriginal Courts have been able to deal with matters to date- we know that this is an administrative matter and we would ask that suitable submissions be made to the Queensland Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, the Land Commissioner in the Northern Territory, has heard many claims by Aboriginal tribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having set a precedent in the Northern Territory the Government will never satisfy tribal Aborigines until they receive the same <span class="highlight">justice</span> as was given to the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continued rate of increase in the 1970s was due to inflation, burgeoning fees, increasing hospital costs largely caused by wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> gained by nurses and other hospital employees and the increase in the use of sophisticated diagnostic techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against these criteria, to have three judges sitting where there are no compelling reasons for matters to come before a full court, is clearly a waste of judicial resources and an unnecessary expense in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the second report of the Ranger Inquiry, at page 248,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether his attention has been drawn to a High Court judgment handed down recently by  His  Honour  Sir Keith  Aickin, in which judgment  His  Honour declared null and void the granting of licences for two commercial radio relay stations in Queensland on the ground that the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board in its hearing had denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not in fact seen the judgment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin in the High Court to which  Senator Douglas  McClelland refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now ask whether the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, has insisted on security and noise standards in sections of the glass work in the building that cannot be met by materials produced in Australia and will require materials to be imported from South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick can tell us what it does not mean but he cannot tell us what it does mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the judgment of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> returned us to the darkness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> would have great difficulty in construing it to mean something that the average person does not think it means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has developed in this chamber a rather vigilant regard for the rights of property so that other officials usually are required before they enforce a right of entry to get a <span class="highlight">justice</span>’s warrant, a warrant authorising search which a <span class="highlight">justice</span> should give only on a prima facie case of reasonable evidence that the entry is required to establish a prima facie offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to  Senator Cavanagh  that the requirement to go before the judge is a much greater protection to the right of property than we usually accord to ordinary property rights which can be trespassed upon when there is a reasonable suspicion of an offence having been committed simply upon the obtaining of a warrant from a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace who has listened to an ex parte statement or seen an affidavit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no suggestion in the recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox that if the Aboriginals do not agree the Government should confiscate the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no suggestion in the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox that the provision in section 7 (2) (a) which gives the right to acquire by proclamation land for development into a national park should ever be permitted in respect of Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1 976, after the Aboriginals have established their traditional right to the land the Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, can recommend to the Minister that the land should be acquired for the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a decision is made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey that certain land should be Aboriginal land, obviously the Minister will request this be so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker went to great lengths to discount much of the rumour and fear, that are circulated on this subject amongst the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox himself saw the Supreme Court as that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am quite prepared to answer them, but I am worried because these matters are before  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, and they are some of the matters on which he has been asked to make a finding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I ought to canvass the matter further because it is in relation to that that I may start to debate the matters which are presently under inquiry before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the files and correspondence that we had have been taken under the wing of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the matters that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor is inquiring into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I do him <span class="highlight">justice</span>, he asserted that the Commonwealth should act unilaterally in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very pleasing for us in the Opposition to see the first report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, but we find it a little disturbing that the report took quite so long to get to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recall that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey was appointed on 7 April 1977; the Northern Land Council submitted a claim on 27 July in respect of Borroloola; we take it from the report that the hearings continued until 15 December of that year; and now, at the end of May, we have received the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be interesting for us to know how long the report has been with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)-  whether he has spent quite an amount of time studying it or whether it was the work of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey that delayed the report’s coming into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel that they have not been fairly treated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey has not respected Aboriginal law and has depended too much on European law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are the traditional owners of the land, and this was accepted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem arises because, after having accepted the Rhumbirriya group as the traditional owners of Centre Island,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey did not recommend a land trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I read the report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey took into account the fact that Mount Isa Mines Ltd wants a berth on the island and wants access to that berth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of the interest of that mining company  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey did not recommend a land trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it would have been better for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey to have suggested that a land trust be established and then to recommend that perhaps some compromise be reached- not that I am not madly happy about this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey should not come out and make a recommendation that no land trust be set up or, in a less positive sense, not recommend that a land trust be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey claimed that there were no traditional owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey has some problems in his method of establishing ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may need to look at the method of questioning that is being used by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey and by his staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I must say I have no criticism of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey or  Dr Reahy  for the work that they are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take a tenet from our own law, I suggest that in this case it is most important that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only be done but also be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out also how in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox filled me with amazement because of the absolute bareness of reference to that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provided <span class="highlight">justice</span> prevails, election results are accepted by both the victor and the vanquished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been outlined in this chamber, <span class="highlight">justice</span> does not prevail in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that I have made it clear to both sides of the chamber that in terms of <span class="highlight">justice</span> we must do something about the position of public servants who nominate for Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some way members have to show that they are determined as representatives of the taxpayers to retrieve a situation of some degree of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and not reduce in 10 years the premiums that they pay to retiring benefits from 58 per cent in 1967 to 1 8 per cent today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, as we will see when we come to consider the Income Tax Bill, that <span class="highlight">justice</span> with regard to the impact of taxation differs between classes in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey stated that it is difficult to prove otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If it is not inconsistent with fundamental rights and duties, the House should avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum or body of inquiry or permit its proceedings to interfere in the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from particular matters such as criminal cases, courts martial, civil cases and matters referred by a legislature to a judicial body, the rule has application to other hearings, inquiries or investigations in which the rights of individuals or a community group or the achievement of <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 250 of the latest edition of his work, he refers to what he describes as the ‘oft-quoted decision’ of  Sir Frederick  Jordan, the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales who, in 1937, in Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd and another, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may well be that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor will find they changed the name solely because of my intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> McGregor is not even inquiring into this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the matters which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor is considering is whether there was a change of name of a proposed division from Gold Coast’ to ‘McPherson’ by reason of actions taken by the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition did not worry about whether the sub judice rule, parliamentary procedure or ordinary natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor will give his judgment in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My view, which I want placed on the record, is that inheritance taxes are as fundamental to a society which has any respect for social <span class="highlight">justice</span> as is a progressive income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is a scandoulous situation of which any Australian with any sense of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be thoroughly ashamed and to which any such Australian should be voicing his or her opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent controversy surrounding the dismissal of  Mr Hove,  Co-Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Law and Order, centred on this very point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-57-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my judgment and in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> I shall adhere to the approach on which I insisted the other day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is continuing to serve our country in this important area as Australia’s ambassador-at-large on nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While on this issue, I should mention that it is becoming increasingly clear that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, Australia’s Ambassador-at-Large, is becoming disenchanted with the prospects of obtaining adequate safeguards on uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having repeated its 1974 comment- and I point out that the  Chairman  of the Tribunal is  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, a prominent Queensland Supreme Court judge- the Tribunal continued: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Button  would like me to, at another time I will give him <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir John  Moore’s comment on what caused the wage rises, the size of the wage rises and the years in which they occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of a public hearing in March of this year in connection with the Committee ‘s reference on Processing Law Reform Proposals, the Committee was presented with sufficient detailed information by the  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission, the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, to enable assessment of the Commission’s difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say- and it is a matter of keen disappointment to me- that after that undertaking was given at a hearing of a Senate Estimates committee last year, that a statute would be placed before us to see whether Parliament would authorise the continuance of these payments, in December or thereabouts a payment of some $38,000 in lieu of long service leave was made to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske on the occasion of his retirement from the Federal Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are peculiar circumstances with regard to the exercise of judicial duties by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske over the last two years since the establishment of the Federal Court- a new Federal Court- to which he was not appointed, but I do not go into the merits of the payment; I go into the constitutionality of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told at the Estimates committee hearing that in his case, simply as a result of the exercise of personal discretion by the Prime Minister, the equivalent of two years salary was paid to the retiring Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the payment to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske is concerned, as had been explained at earlier hearings of the Senate Estimates committee, payments of this kind had been made to a number of judges in pursuance of a Cabinet decision taken some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, last year one of the payments under consideration was that to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McTiernan upon his retirement from the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske retired at the end of the year it would have been most unfair to him not to have had the entitlement which all other judges who had retired over many years had received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Estimates committee that examined this item considered it to be of such transcendental importance to the Parliament, to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country and to the integrity of Cabinet that it was a matter proper for debate on the floor of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly- I am compressing what I have to say because I know that for the Senate time is important- it is without precedent in the history of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> that any political body, mid-way through a case, should come to the financial support of either party alone, in this case ex-Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir REGINALD WRIGHT (Tasmania) (4.56)- I am very conscious of the time of the Committee, but  Senator Wriedt  ‘s comments illustrate perfectly how intervention by a political body in the law administration excites disquiet on one side and dissatisfaction on the other, and why the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be left to a proper conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, in a reservation  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey subsequently opposed his own Committee’s recommendation on two grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his reservation  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Asprey acknowledged that everything would hinge upon the rates scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This statement as to the law has been recently approved by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court in the 1 977 case of Slutzkin v. the Commissioner of Taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Senate to even dream of giving the tax dodgers protection at this late date is not in the Government’s interest, not in the economy’s interest and it is certainly not in the interests of ordinary <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although in Fuller’s Case the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was in a minority his views were preferred to those of the majority (Fullagar and Menzies JJ) when the matter was again examined by this court in Gibb v Federal Commissioner of Taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was there pointed out ( 1 1 8 CLR at 632 ), that his Honour’s view that an issue of bonus shares could not, according to ordinary principles, be regarded as any receipt of income by the shareholder accorded with that of one of the majority, Menzies J, whose views differed from those of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> only concerning the effect of the Income Tax <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with the Government’s policy throughout this matter- as reflected in  Senator Durack  ‘s letter to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor of 1 1 May- to have all allegations of illegality or impropriety in the course of the McPherson redistribution fully heard and determined, Cabinet decided on 30 May to have the terms of reference widened again so that the Royal Commission could make a finding on whether any breach of the law of the Commonwealth or any impropriety had occurred on the part of any person in the course of the McPherson redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> McGregor thus found that an impropriety had been committed not because of  Senator Withers’  act of communicating with  Mr Pearson  about the name of the electorate but because of the purpose with which he did it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister responsible for funding tertiary institutions, does not the Minister think that this case reflects very gravely upon the concept of academic freedom as practised by the University of New South Wales, the fact that one can get <span class="highlight">justice</span> only if one has the money, and the failure of the State Labor Government to end compulsory membership of student unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is, therefore, that I have sought and later today or tomorrow I will be receiving a report from the Director-General of Security,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, in relation to this matter and to other allegations contained in the book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As it happens, I have an appointment to see  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward tomorrow about other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is based on submissions I made during the adjournment debate a fortnight ago when I sought information on the acreage of the proposed Kakadu National Park as set out in the second report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry as compared with the Alaskan parklands provided for in legislation of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have the recent adjustments to approvals for mining operations in the Ranger area in any way infringed or fudged on the original boundaries defined by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the second point which he raised, as to the proposals that are currently before the Government, I am not aware of any infringement of the original area as defined by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and his colleagues lay down what the amount of wage indexation will be, that decision is based on price rises in the previous three months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make is that when the Government argues about the 1.5 per cent or 2.5 per cent increase that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore may grant at quarterly or half-yearly intervals it should remember that those increases are based on price fluctuations during the previous three months or six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last year the Prime Minister announced the acceptance of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations and foreshadowed the intentions of the Government in regard to implementing the recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Crichton-Browne, it is true, escaped conviction under a system which masquerades as <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Western Australia, but the following facts are not in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, is the Minister aware that the Swinburne College of Technology Student Union, which is controlled by Maoist student groups, recently appropriated $500 of student money to the National Overseas Students Service and $200 to radio station 3CR, both payments being outside the criteria established by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kaye ‘s judgment in the recent Robert Clarke case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: In view of the renewal of aid by the United States to Turkey and acting on the assumption that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is coming to Cyprus, will the Minister make a statement during the next three-week sitting as to what role Australia has played at the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing could be further from the truth and those who have sought to perpetuate that myth not only do less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the intentions of the Government, but more importantly they do a grave disservice to the Australian public by trivialising the debate on such an important subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Australian National Group yet made its choice of candidates for election to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>; if so, who are the candidates; if not, when will the decision be made, and will the Attorney-General make the names public immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether his attention has been drawn to a High Court judgment handed down recently by  His  Honour  Sir Keith  Aickin, in which judgment  His  Honour declared null and void the granting of licences for two commercial radio relay stations in Queensland on the ground that the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board in its hearing had denied natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although we have faithfully served our former country and the allied cause throughout the second World War and having since resided in Australia for thirty years, we find ourselves being denied the simple <span class="highlight">justice</span> accorded to other exservicemen, by their respective countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I guess we cannot expect taxation <span class="highlight">justice</span> or any taxation morality from a government of which nearly all the senior Ministers, despite all their public posturing about cracking down on tax evasion, participate directly in tax dodging family trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: When will those white collar workers get <span class="highlight">justice</span> with regard to superannuation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter was referred to the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in New South Wales and me by a letter from the directors dated 8 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, which I think is the aspect with which the honourable senator is concerned, that does not worry me as much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that insofar as he is doing that it is ensuring that the people shall pay in <span class="highlight">justice</span> their taxation and that the tricky ones will not get away with tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it correct to suggest that there has been a decline in the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I said at the beginning of my answer, I think the problems are ones that can be overcome and I think it is exaggerating matters to say that as a result of the situation there is a decline in the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Attorney-General and follows the question asked by  Senator Knight  regarding the charge by the Chief Magistrate,  Mr Kilduff,  that there has been a decline in the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt that saying there has been a decline in the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> is a serious charge and because that claim was made by the Chief Magistrate I made it my business to inform myself about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, I have discussions from time to time about these questions with officers of the Department, but having gone into the matter it seems to me that it was an exaggeration to say that there was a decline in the quality of <span class="highlight">justice</span> because of the nature of the staffing difficulties that had arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to a recent speech by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead in which, when discussing the Family Law Act, he said: ‘The judges are undertaking unacceptable work loads, counsellors are at their wit’s end, the welfare officers despite best endeavours find it almost impossible to keep up to date ‘? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead described the family law counsellors as a vital arm of the system and drew attention to the fact that the system is understaffed by at least 30 per cent in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to let the matter rest where it is, and intend to raise the matter in the Senate if I do not receive a satisfactory explanation of this situation, and am informed that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will now be done to this man, preferably by the re-opening of the appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be deprived of a justified increase for one year means <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is from the leading article in the  West Australian,  Perth, Saturday, 14 October under the heading ‘Pension <span class="highlight">justice</span>’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most unwholesome feature of the Budget was the way in which social <span class="highlight">justice</span> was jettisoned for the sake of a cold exercise in accountancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We consider that all pensioners, particularly the over 70s (and many of our members are in this age group), will appreciate your stand in your editorial ‘Pension <span class="highlight">justice</span>’ (October 14). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are concerned enough to stand up in the Senate and in the other House and say that they will not vote for this Bill because they do not see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being done for the people who are least able to alford these sacrifices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who have been made to suffer under this legislation have made many and repeated appeals to the Government to give them <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find that the same situation applies in many other country towns in South Australia; that is, more people receive pensions in many country towns in South Australia than vote for the Australian Labor Party, which when it was in government gave them <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe simply that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied and if there is a standard of benefit or pension which is appropriate to a circumstance it is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied to fail to adjust that rate for increases in the cost of living as those increases in the cost of living are assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister realise the legal consequences that may arise from  Mr Gyngell  ‘s present behaviour at the hearings which, according to the Broadcasting and Television Act, are to be conducted according to the rules of fair and natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Government and the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  are very concerned to see that social <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They obviously are attached to the principle of indexation as they are attached to the principle that if the Government establishes a rate of pension or benefit which it thinks, in terms of social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, is adequate, then that rate should not be eroded by price increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is another equally justified principle and that is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then people may feel that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is seen to be done as well as being done, and we will not have the hassles which have arisen in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appeals should be made on the score of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and a wrong having been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One makes a choice whether one puts one’s case to the Department of Social Security or takes civil action to get <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Minister is asking this Committee tonight to pass a Bill that will prohibit me from getting information which would indicate whether I am receiving <span class="highlight">justice</span> from the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see that all the legal men on the Government side of the chamber have run out of the chamber during this debate, but knowing their keenness to see <span class="highlight">justice</span> done and their interest in the operation of our legal system, I doubt whether, if a proper appeal were made to them, any of them, or any of the legal men on this side, would vote in favour of this proposed new section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see the <span class="highlight">justice</span> in denying legal aid to those people simply because there might be some injustice or inequity suffered by the defendant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those prophetic words were not delivered from the pulpit, or from any public forum, but from the very source itself- the steps of a white man’s much vaunted hall of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, after Namatjira had felt the cruel barbs of his white brother’s brand of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To further reinforce the need for the provisions of this Bill, I quote directly from  Aborigines, A Statement of Concern,  prepared by the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, for the Catholic Bishops of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rarely have they sought <span class="highlight">justice</span> through civil courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We earnestly request that you as Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Parliament should ensure that this Bill does not become Law until every aspect of the Bill is thoroughly and conscientiously examined and that the continuation of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all should be viewed with paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that to try to do so today in the absence of confirmation of telegrams and statements which are appearing in newspapers would not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to an adequate debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discretion of a court to set aside a property settlement order will be exercisable where there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> arising from circumstances other than those now specified by the Act, such as fraud or false evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But whatever the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the wisdom of providing or not providing cheap credit for agriculture, there can be no justification for cynical pre-election prime ministerial promises to deliver cheap money- promises which are inoperative as soon as the votes are safely in the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has drawn my attention to the case of Schulsinger in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fogarty, a judge of the Family Court in Melbourne, had to point out that the costs scales did not apply to party and party taxations but only to taxations between a solicitor and his client. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are concerned not merely with the person who is a pensioner; we are concerned in this area with people who have lowish incomes and those who have ordinary incomes who find that they cannot afford the very expensive costs of trying to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> in law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it has been the practice of successive Ministers in the exercise of this discretionary power generally not to give reasons in respect of particular cases, it has long been the policy of successive Ministers to withhold passports from persons who are attempting to escape from <span class="highlight">justice</span>, are the subject of court orders restraining departure, are of unsound mind, are under the age of 1 7 years and unable to produce the consent of both parents or are the subject of custody or access orders of Australian courts, and those for whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs could not, in the context of Australia’s international relations, request other countries to provide free passage, protection and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Assembly’s response in essence recommended the prohibition of private clinics, the establishment of a self-contained clinic within the grounds of a public hospital and the application of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt ‘s rulings as the law governing abortion in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To do  Senator Evans  some <span class="highlight">justice</span>, he did say: ‘Well, you know, the poll was a bit dicey’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not accept that point of view, although if one wants to one can rely on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  MacNaghten’s ruling in Rex v. Bourne in 1939 in England or  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt ‘s ruling in Regina v.

    <p>One can turn to the report of  Mrs <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Lane and the British Royal Commission in 1974 that perhaps went further than anybody on this question in advocating that pregnancies could be terminated up until the 24th week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rulings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt are: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On those grounds the Government obviously came to the conclusion to draft the ordinance in the form that it has in order to protect the health of those who within the law are seeking abortions within  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt ‘s ruling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These principles can be summed up in the following way: the primary aim of disciplinary provisions should be to facilitate efficient administration and public confidence in the integrity of the administration; there should be no unnecessary concern with the private lives of staff members; provisions should be seen as a complement to other management processes of supervision, leadership and staff counselling, with disciplinary action generally being a last resort; the disciplinary process should continue to be essentially administrative rather than judicial, but the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and fairness should be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been led to understand- I communicated this understanding to the Minister in the course of the Estimates Committee proceedings- that at least one of the High Court justices had taken the view that it was inappropriate or wrong for students to be exposed to the argument that takes place in the High Court before such argument has been shaped up or the High Court judges’ opinions have reached final fruition in the form of their final written opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That that is so was not disconfirmed by anything which was said in the written reply to which I referred, in which it is acknowledged that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> made some comment upon this whole issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has expressed the view that transcripts of argument are made to enable Justices to refresh their recollection when considering judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> took that particular view of the function of transcript rather suggests that he was also of the view, as I suggested might have been possible, that the provision of this material to law school academics, researchers and students, was bad; that it would give them misconceived ideas of the nature of the judicial process; and that perhaps not only would it make them excessively willing to criticise High Court judges for what they produced in their final opinions, which these academics are prone enough to do at the moment, but also might it tempt them to start using the text of what fell from judges in the course of argument as further grounds for criticising them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators that substantially the Ranger report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox also said this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I reiterate that the basis of my original question was a newspaper article which quoted a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace who had previously been a Telecommunications Commission linesman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that his allegations were reasonably well founded and that, being a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, he was somebody whom one could reasonably expect to give fair information on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the conflict between the information provided in the Minister’s answer last week and the allegations made in the article by, I remind the Minister, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace last May, I ask: What checks are or can be made on the improper use of private subscribers’ telephone lines and how can these subscribers be protected against a betrayal of a position of trust by such people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An allegation in relation to a very serious breach- a specific allegation in relation to particular uses of equipment by telecommunications technicians- produced the response that since it was not a specific allegation, presumably in relation to a specific individual on a specific date, Telecom did not consider, according to its answer on 11 November that any further useful information would have been available from direct contact with the informant who was, I reiterate, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace and a former Telecommunications Commission linesman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst that particular justification for making the subsidy available is a possible factor, and no doubt was a factor in the Government coining to its decision, I believe it does less than <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those in government who have taken this decision in the face of considerable political pressures from within the joint Party room, in the face of the Industrial Assistance Commission report which was quite firm in its conclusion that aid should be refused and in the absence of any sort of regional development policy to cope with such a situation as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He neglected to mention that the salary was almost doubled at the time he took the job and the pension, which made future employment possible but unnecessary, was lifted to about three times the level of the average weekly wage and is linked to the salary of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> so that it increases substantially year by year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a truly disgraceful thing that the former GovernorGeneral of Australia, a member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council formerly Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of his State, for years a Federal Judge should be accused of having venally bargained with a political leader to dismiss a government, place him in power, later resign from the Governorgeneralship- and before actually leaving- presumably as some sort of final encore- grant him improperly a dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the new factor that has entered the problem and that necessitates the amendment on this occasion is that the  Chairman  of the Tribunal,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell, who has impressed everybody with the way in which he has conducted his duties, has been appointed, probably in recognition of the prowess that he has displayed, Chancellor of the University of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inquiry by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and various other events brought about a most controversial situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The panel which makes nominations on behalf of Australia in regard to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is an independent body of distinguished Australians and I would reject any suggestion contained in  Senator Evans’  question that they would be in any way motivated by political considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, any action taken by unionists to protect the strength and the bargaining power of themselves and their union by an endeavour to unionise work places which are not unionised or not completely unionised at the time of such action- for example, the kind of action that is in issue in the present Alliance Messenger dispute in which the Transport Workers Union again finds itself involved and which aroused the indignation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers earlier this week- again is clearly outside the scope of those limited exemptions for which the Act provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the statements which came from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers could have been said only because the Government has put laws on the statute books which are untenable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that I must do so because the subject is an important one and I would like the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to make some inquiries in the forthcoming recess into what should be done to ensure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is seen to be done in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that it is to the good of the whole community that if an injustice has been done or if it seems that an injustice has been done we take action and prevent either the reality of the injustice or the appearance of the injustice from worsening community relations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because it has happened in this country, I believe that when the court case is heard and the judgment of the court delivered <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be seen to have been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A press release issued by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia on 10 April 1 970 relating to the Fourth Conference was referred to in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times on 11 April 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The costs incurred by the Commonwealth Government for attendance of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at the Conferences in Japan, Thailand, Korea, New Zealand and Indonesia were for the air fares for himself and his wife to and from the host country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the nature of Australia’s interest in the composition of the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, referred to in the Minister’s answer to Question 973  (Hansard,  22 November 1978, page 2425). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-110-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be contrary to the expectations of ordinary people, as  Senator Missen  pointed out, if I, when returning to Tasmania, to that efficient and beautiful port of Devonport across Bass Strait, were subjected to assault by somebody with a deadly weapon and, rather than bring that culprit to <span class="highlight">justice</span> under Victorian or Tasmanian law, had to seek to bring him to <span class="highlight">justice</span> under United Kingdom statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The magistrate in the Queanbeyan Court handed down a ruling that there is no case to be answered by  Mr Whitlam, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy,  Dr Cairns  and our ex-colleague the late  Mr Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the prevailing law is that stated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Menhennitt in the Victorian Supreme Court in 1 969 and by Judge Levine in the New South Wales District Court in October 1971; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-62-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Attorney-General and concerns another apparently neglected contribution to Australian jurisprudence by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, following his extended tour overseas, has recently produced a report recommending quite substantial changes in human rights law, which report the Commonwealth has refused to make public or, indeed, to produce on request to meetings of the FederalState Standing Committee of AttorneysGeneral? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples was overseas he did send back from Canada- I think it was only from Canada but I am not sure- some reports on what he had found there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to table anything that I have received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples until I receive a full report in the sense in which I expect to have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do not want to give the impression that there is anything secret about the material which I have received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I have not had any response from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples as to when I might- or if I might- expect to receive a report as I have requested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then and only then will the pensioners know where they are, will the Parliament know where it is and will some <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done and be seen to be done for these people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call on the Government to recognise the contribution our pioneers have made and to show both <span class="highlight">justice</span> and compassion towards their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all of us in this place should support the proposition put forward by  Senator Grimes  not only on moral grounds and in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, but also because of the simple, old truism: ‘There but for the grace of God go I’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has to look at the real needs, the real <span class="highlight">justice</span>, behind the whole idea of paying pensions to certain sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again remind the Senate that the resolution I put down on 27 April 1976 taking account of the principle that <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied was not supported by  Senator Grimes  or by any other senator in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so on the principle that if we delay <span class="highlight">justice</span> any further, then <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be denied for that period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate, moreover, that the grand jury inquiry into the uranium marketing arrangements has been concluded and that no proceedings by the United States <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Department have been instituted against any Australian company in consequence of that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That allowed for a period during which the heads of agreement on which the consultations took place could be considered in detail by the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and other United States departments involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the decision given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin in the High Court on 16 February 1 979 to the effect that private citizens and organisations claiming a non-property interest cannot enforce compliance by the Government with the administrative procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen the judgment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin dealt with the legal entitlements of the Australian Conservation Foundation to bring an action against the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin struck out the ACF’s statement of claim and dismissed the action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the cost of conducting High Court legal actions, the limited financial resources of the ACF and the strength of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin ‘s judgment, it is unlikely that the ACF will appeal against the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would mean that the earlier judgment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Aickin may be sidestepped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A larger question which is raised by this Bill and to which I think it is appropriate to direct the Senate’s attention for a few moments is whether the kind of co-ordinated jurisdiction model that the Government is endeavouring to implement with this legislation is really the best ultimate or long term solution to the problem of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear natural to endeavour to establish the courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as independent organs which were neither Commonwealth nor State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate has continued more recently with a major contribution along these lines by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell in 1970 and more recently again in a paper delivered by  Mr Bob  Ellicott to the 19th Australian Legal Convention in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a quite refreshing burst of judicial candour the trial judge in that case,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Helsham, who is Chief Judge in Equity in the New South Wales Supreme Court, was moved to make a public statement at the conclusion of that case in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This point also has been taken, although I suspect rather less sincerely, by the New South Wales Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Laurence  Street, who has been the most conspicuous public opponent of the recent developments in the Federal courts system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So while the Government is to be congratulated for going as far as it has in this Bill and the earlier legislation to improve the coordination of the present system, I would hate it to abandon altogether the ultimate goal of a unified system of administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that  Senator Evans  contradicted his claim about this matter being a political one when he acknowledged that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales has been maintaining probably a stronger campaign than any politician on the proposed unified courts structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly do believe that step by step not only will we be able to improve the present situation and get a more co-ordinated structure but also, by this method, by avoiding the unnecessary creation of a dual court system with all the problems which so worry the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales and many other people, including me, no doubt  Senator Evans  and indeed all lawyers who think about this matter, we will be able to move slowly and steadily towards a uniform court system, even though that system might well be based on the very solid foundation of the existing State court system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>provision to be made to issue local ordinances and establish better facilities for the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the AttorneyGeneral has done has been to recognise that, within a certain appropriation, if he wants to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> in one area he can do it only by restricting access in another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senior departmental officers have held discussions with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and provided him with information in connection with his protective security review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department has received information from the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in New Zealand that the preparation of reciprocal legislation is currently under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Foreign Antitrust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Bill 1979 brings to a sort of finality a dispute which has been festering between the Australian and United States Governments for some years, particularly in relation to the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that the decision by the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to enforce vigorously its anti-trust legislation against overseas resource companies selling minerals and energy products in the US is simply a part of the US consumers’ effort to strengthen their bargaining position in the world market for the sorts of commodities that we can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that end, we have been holding very extensive consultations with the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in the United States to try to see whether there are ways of preventing conflicts of this type arising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate knows, I visited Washington with officers of my Department, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Trade and Resources in September of last year and had very fruitful discussions with officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the State Department and the Federal Trade Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to operate in vacuo, without consideration of some of the broader social factors raised by the Royal Commission the Institute will not do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to itself, society and the Parliament which, by legislation, has created it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further major point of the legislation is that it also slightly extends the authority of the courts to set aside or discharge property settlements or maintenance orders under the Act if there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the original settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Evatt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will enable the Court to consider the whole question and to make decisions that do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is extended to include any other circumstance where there has been a miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> (clause 12). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is against the very principles of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to couch legislation in these terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But you do me too much <span class="highlight">justice</span>, senator, because I had to re-read my speech to find out where I was up to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen restated the provisions of section 107 of the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his judgment  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen makes the comment that paragraph (c)- that one which talks of the satisfaction of the Director-General- is not directly concerned with factual circumstances but rather with the state of mind of the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore it does not matter if you can establish a case- that you are unemployed, that you do intend to remain permanently in Australia, that your unemployment is not due to your own action, or that you are prepared and capable of taking a job- according to the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Stephen, this does not mean that you are entitled to the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Chaney  referred to a judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kitto which said that under the Act, as amended in 1967, an appeal court is an appeal court in name only and that its function is not only that of a court of appellate jurisdiction but also that of a court with as much original jurisdiction as if there were no Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this was the purpose for which the second $50,000 loan was being made- making a grand total of $100,000 being given to the Beggs family for disaster relief- how much stronger does that make the criticisms that I have already advanced about the doubts which surround the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of and the justification for a loan being made at all to the Beggs family, given the $180,000 it received from the State Electricity Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The two major devices recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to protect the environment and the Aborigines in the Alligator Rivers region have been disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox stated in his report that he clearly believed this would place too much stress on Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of an independent tribunal, combining the functions of both of the current Repatriation tribunals was proposed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I also emphasise that the essential principles of the Repatriation Appeals System- those that have protected appellants and conferred upon them rights to ensure that every opportunity is given to them to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span>- are being retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court is a non-elected bench of justices who are politically irresponsible in a strict sense in that they do not have to answer to anyone for their activity no matter how devastating that activity may be within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that that Court, particularly under Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. South Australian Battery Makers Pty Ltd,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy demonstrated some of the skills which have commended him to so many Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the Master of the Rolls,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Green in 1942 indicated the judiciary’s view that retrospective legislation in regard to tax matters was compatible with the normal protection by common law judges of citizens against legislation of a penal character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the provisions are quite complex and in order to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the question I will act, as  Senator Wriedt  suggested, and see that he is provided with a written answer which will fully cover the points raised by him in the query he raised on those proposed sections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span> against Parliament and against the individual member of the Parliament that the Government is prepared to treat a matter in such a cavalier fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the reduction of the qualifying period an undertaking given to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor before he sat on the royal commission of inquiry into the Queensland electoral boundaries dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> McGregor was appointed to the Federal Court in, I think, about October 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I could ascertain from discussions with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, he accepted the offer of appointment to the bench without any consideration of this matter of a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did mention this fact to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor, but that was after he had indicated to me his acceptance of the offer of appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, the only discussion that I had with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor in relation to this matter was when he was appointed to the court, which was in October 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General: Are there any present Justices of the High Court or the Federal Court of Australia who will be beneficiaries under the proposed amendments to the Judges Pension Act or is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor the only present judge who will be affected by the proposed amendments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware only two judges,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor of the Federal Court, and a judge of the Family Court, will be affected by the amendments dealing with compulsory retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">justice</span> of that situation is quite straightforward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope after a thorough and searching examination of the needs of the nation for a security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation was foreshadowed in the statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the House of Representatives on 25 October 1977 when he outlined in broad terms the Government’s decisions to implement reforms affecting the intelligence security agencies recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, there have been substantial changes to ASIO since the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward on 9 March 1976 and particularly since the recommendations of the royal commission were accepted in 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has instituted a rigorous system of internal checks to ensure that the Organisation’s intelligence collection is geared as closely as possible to the assessed national security priorities and therefore that resources are most efficiently deployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can report to Parliament that this new system, recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, has brought substantial improvements to the overall management of the intelligence community and has prompted a range of ongoing reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope pointed out that the justification for the existence of a security organisation in a democratic country should be reflected in its charter and, in particular, its functions as set out in that charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of clause 20 requiring the Director-General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the work of the Organisation is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions and that the Organisation is kept free from any influences not relevant to its functions, follow closely the significant recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, in accordance with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendation, the provisions of the Bill relating to the DirectorGeneral, particularly as regards tenure of office and the grounds on which his appointment may be terminated, have been brought in line with provisions dealing with statutory office holders in other Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statutory procedures for notification of security assessments and for rights of appeal in large part implement the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope concluded that legal doubts as to the nature of this relationship that had arisen under the terms of the present Act should be removed and the relationship should be clearly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, Australia is indeed fortunate in having an outstanding Director-General and I am sure the members of all parties share that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the  Sir Edward  Pellew group, one of the islands not granted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey has been declared a town site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can paraphrase the line that was used so often by people who learnt typing years ago, now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the Aborigines and of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in the whole context of raising revenue for necessary government expenditure and given the difficulty which we know the Government faces in that regard, it may be that this is a matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, fairness and equity to employees and ordinary traders will become swamped in considerations of raising revenue for government, not that this particular priority raises much more than $6m or $8m for government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as my own role is concerned with the Borroloola situation, I do not propose to take action on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey ‘s recommendation with respect to the Borroloola common until the parties have had a chance to hold those discussions because I do not wish to pre-empt any agreement which may be reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I have agreed with the Borroloola people that I will examine the possibility of issuing a title to the islands which was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he would do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Ministry when he is elevated to that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole sequence of events revealed the true nature of the situation, how <span class="highlight">justice</span> is applied at the lower level in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one discovers the reality is that the magistrate is a servant of the Queensland Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently in Melbourne I attended a meeting organised for the purpose of bringing together some of these people in an attempt to bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to people affected by the Government’s neglect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we are concerned that <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but also must be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the people have little grasp of our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and law; many have a very poor grasp of English; some of them in fact are illiterate in their own language; they are certainly ignorant of their rights under our laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of confidence can they have when they appear in our courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if that sort of thing occurs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally on the matter of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I would like to question the fact that the basic concept of innocent until proven guilty, which most of us accept as fairly basic to our legal system, would appear to have been offended in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not so- we are endeavouring to help people to obtain their rights and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to assume a person guilty until proven innocent is contrary to our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was happening was that people were losing their benefits before they were investigated and before they were charged, and this was giving the impression in the Greek community that the principle of British <span class="highlight">justice</span> that we all talk about was being ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have an independent inquiry at the same time as <span class="highlight">justice</span> is being sought through the courts would seem to me to be a peculiar way to conduct the affairs of a government department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Archbishop and I both said that the Greek community and the Commonwealth Government have a mutual concern to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected and that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also stressed that the moral aspect of the matter required that truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> dominate the procedures involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early next week in New South Wales the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Australian courts will be applied to those people against whom charges have been laid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that court hearings in the system of the Australian courts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> could have very great distractions if an Opposition were to pursue a political and independent inquiry at a time when the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the courts must be seen to be done- as  Senator Grimes  urged was essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have their legal rights which they have been exercising and will continue to exercise, and I am sure that the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country is well able to cope with the situation without the aid of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actually, it is designed not to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> for people but is a way in which the Opposition hopes to obtain reform of the defamation laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should not be taken to an independent inquiry which the Opposition wants to set up, an inquiry which will obstruct the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this country and interfere with matters which are being litigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Archbishop in stressing the moral aspect of the matter expressed his vivid interest in seeing truth and <span class="highlight">justice</span> dominate the whole procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be satisfied that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and that matters which are the responsibility of the Minister are dealt with in this chamber by way of questions which the Minister will answer fairly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in keeping with the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose in his report on the repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past the concern for the greater numbers of civil pensioners and their beneficiaries has clouded the fact that the veterans also were involved and also will fail to get economic <span class="highlight">justice</span> as a result of this Budget decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his royal commission report, found a number of illegalities, so-called, in relation to the conduct of members of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make there is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found a number of disquieting aspects of the operation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in the context of the inquiry that he conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say, in all fairness, that some of the other recommendations which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made, and which did not require legislation, have already been implemented by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be so, senator, but in fact we have not been told, and one hopes that the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope that have been implemented are operating effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard the provision in the legislation as inadequate and very much regret that the tribunal is not to give effect to that element of retrospectivity which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraphs 141 and 142 of his report he made the point that incorrect security assessments may remain, to persons who were adversely affected, a potential source of injustice for the rest of their careers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the principle of ministerial control and responsibility to which I have referred and to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his third report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope specifically criticised that sort of concept and made an important historical comment- I have said that we have to see this in the context of experience- when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  gave high praise to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, the present Director-General of ASIO, and we make no criticism of and no hostile comment about those remarks of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all hope that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has found the secret of eternal life as Director-General of ASIO and that that observation may not be true but, of course, it is true, and experience shows us that organisations such as the Central Intelligence Agency and the American Government have made very drastic mistakes by tending to leave matters of this kind, which are properly the subject matter of very clear legislation, to the whims of a particular director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was pretty strong on a bipartisan approach te legislation of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his fourth report said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the definitions proposed within the ASIO Bill, drawn as they are from the extensive research and work done by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his review of Australia’s security services, indicate that we have attempted to grapple in a fair and reasonable way with those definitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anybody would dispute- certainly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has not at any stage sought to dispute- the need for some sort of security service in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From paragraph 1 1 onwards in the second report of the Royal Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope deals with this particular problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even after his exhaustive review in South Australia,  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White was moved to comment on page 25 of his report in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has considered in detail the nature and definition of terms such as ‘ terrorism ‘ and ‘ security ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell in her royal commission report on the dismissal of Harold Hubert Salisbury observed the way in which Commissioner Salisbury regarded his relationship with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One knows from the report of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White about the arms full of material kept in South Australia’s Special Branch- much of it exchanged with ASIO and much of it, in his words, ‘scandalously inaccurate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote from what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Louis Brandeis had to say in talking about the activities of law enforcement and intelligence gathering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we have now seen the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as the Director-General, a man of whose personal competence and integrity we are in no doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already said about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that the Opposition does have complete confidence in his competence and integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investigation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, although we by no means agree with all of his recommendations, was itself an indication of the value of this kind of independent judicial scrutiny of and report on a security agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, too, in our opinion, although there might be contrary views about this from some sources, was the action of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in relation to cleaning up the extraordinary mess that the South Australian Special Branch had got itself into, as revealed in the course of the Salisbury affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bipartisan aspect of the new security arrangements was emphasised a very great deal by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope clearly and unequivocally recommended that the new appeals procedure be retrospective in operation so that people who have been adversely affected in the past in their career opportunities, their citizenship applications and so on, should have the opportunity to get the validity of those proceedings in the past independently assessed and reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope reported that in the five years before 1977 ASIO security checks were done on 344,000 different people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope, the royal commissioner, said in his report tabled in the Parliament in October 1 977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made the following pointed comment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These words are the more significant in view of the fact that their author,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, is not your raving reactionary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope declared in his report that a security organisation fulfilling its proper role is entitled to the confidence and respect of the nation as is the Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference has been made to the fact that a number of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s recommendations have been implemented already in the administrative field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must bear in mind the statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope that such an organisation does deserve the confidence and respect of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we are faced with the threats to our security which were outlined in the report of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, the Royal Commissioner on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reforms embodied in the Bill before us were recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security after he had conducted a thorough and searching review of our needs for a security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I need hardly remind the Senate that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was appointed by the Whitlam Government and it is to be hoped that in these discussions a bi-partisan attitude, which was not entirely evident when  Senator Evans  was speaking, will shine through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a clear recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and I do not think that any honourable senator here could possibly disagree with that recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the main outrage of  Senator Murphy’s  celebrated raid on ASIO is the thought of him leafing through raw dossiers on individuals, an action which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope pointed out should have been resisted by ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I would be speaking for most members of the Australian Labor Party when I say that at least this Bill, insofar as it embodies the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, will bring about considerable improvements on the law as it has stood up till now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen by way of interjection a few minutes ago referred to the fact that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself in his report had referred to the leaking of information from ASIO to the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something that was established in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly think that anybody who reads  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report with any degree of intelligence will know that that suggestion is implicit in  His  Honour’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Lands Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey of the Northern Territory Supreme Court, proposes to consider on 2 April this year the claims lodged by the Central Land Council in respect of land comprising the Park and other lands in the area of the Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the notion of impropriety gave  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor considerable difficulty when looking into the activities of  Mr Eric  Robinson and  Senator Withers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor pointed out, the word ‘impropriety’ is not susceptible to close definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor had difficulty with the concept was that the Government of the day has made no attempt to define what it thinks are the proper standards of conduct of Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  was sacked because of the way in which he gave evidence before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor and his admission to the Senate that he may have misled it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot have escaped honourable senators that the Fraser Government set up an inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nigel Bowen to look at the whole question of pecuniary interests, not only of Ministers but of members of parliament and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers,  who was found guilty of impropriety but not a breach of the law-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor said definitely that there was no breach of the law- is out of the Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot condemn judges of the court because that is contrary to Standing Orders; but the decision of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in the Webster case has been criticised throughout the Australian legal profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr becoming Governor-General:  to appoint  Senator Murphy  to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the things the mining industry suggests is that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, when making decisions, recognises that the Act compels him to give more favourable consideration to Aboriginal ownership rights than to the rights of other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toohey will grant land to the Aboriginal people only when white men do not want it or show little interest in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think many honourable senators would know <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should not cast such a reflection on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people to whom I am referring are Europeans- the small businessmen, small tourist operators, who at the moment have great difficulty in putting their cases before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey for one reason, namely that they do not have the financial ability to obtain the services of the kind of people who are putting the cases for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as  Senator Cavanagh  has said, that I have yet to issue titles with respect to the land at Borroloola as has been recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until those negotiations are completed, I do not wish to commit myself on the requests which have been made to me or on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey ‘s recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that I will be able to take action on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey ‘s report in accordance with an agreement between the parties concerned with Borroloola which will be more satisfactory for them than the position that exists at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations has been making strong representations and conducting a campaign to get <span class="highlight">justice</span> for these workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was glad to hear the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  today, in answer to a question asked by  Senator Bishop,  state that she, at last after all this time, is aware of the difficulties and injustices which apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meeting was called to present their case and to swap information so that some <span class="highlight">justice</span> could be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Service, I believe, should be good and should be automatic both to the employees and to the Commissioner so that he knows what is going on and can make sure that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would bring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a lot of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is inappropriate that such large sums of public money should be spent on ‘investigations’ such as those castigated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White in South Australia which merely lead to files on people pursuing legitimate public interest causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is led to some concern on these matters by the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, who gave specific examples of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in fact committing indiscretions and in fact being incompetent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation allegedly will put  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations into words which will be binding on all citizens of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services read the comments attributed to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead when speaking at a symposium in Adelaide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Muirhead is also reported as seeing a need in the Territory for a special branch of the Commonwealth Police as a counter to terrorism which he sees as a potential threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not seen the reports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead ‘s comments but the extracts read to the Senate by the honourable senator make some sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Marks found that the Commission was acting outside the scope of the Act in developing a site at Keilor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case, decided by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Marks, concerned 67 acres of land, most of it owned by the Housing Commission of Victoria and the rest owned by the Keilor City Council, which the Housing Commission of Victoria wanted to develop as a community centre with schools, a hotel, parkland and a shopping centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument which, in short, was upheld by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Marks of the Supreme Court of Victoria and the decision of the Court was that the Housing Commission was acting illegally in purchasing and arranging for the servicing of this land with Commonwealth funds because it was not acting for purposes set down in the Victorian Housing Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to repeal two earlier Acts of 1956 and 1976, and purports to give effect to the finding of the royal commission headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that the legislation does give effect to the findings of the royal commission headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, the Opposition welcomes the introduction of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be farcical if it were not so blatant a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, I think, important to realise that it quite substantially implements, but not wholly, the Hope reports- the reports which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope presented to the Government after a great deal of consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it must also be understood that the second, third and fourth reports omit a number of matters which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope felt could not possibly be made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on page 70 of the first volume of his fourth report talks about questions of the particular principles of propriety including legality to which ASIO should have regard in fulfilling its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his fourth volume,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred to this general trend towards more open government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope says that in the future this may change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we must bear in mind in respect of this freedom of information area what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said in the small part of his third report which was disclosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should also bear in mind the warning <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope gives in paragraph 46 of the report which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope also made this statement in his fourth report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this has been advocated often but  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did not applaud it, nor does the Bill include it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his fourth report, expressed the view- and applauded the suggestion of the Treasury- that provisions for audit ought to be set out in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the Bill generally follows the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, but there are five matters which I think must be mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his second report, came to a different conclusion about this aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope pointed out in the second volume of his fourth report that there are other cases and they will not be covered by this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the Prime Minister, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommended; it is the Attorney-General who can make the decision to deny a person the right of appeal on information which may be mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not necessarily saying that we should undertake an investigation such as that undertaken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to quote briefly some excerpts from the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 14  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading between the lines, I think  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is suggesting that over a period many people working in ASIO and perhaps high up in the echelon have not had high personal qualities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know and we shall never know what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is not prepared to publish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went on in paragraph 1 8 to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fairly damaging charge for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to make about an organisation which has been in existence in this country for some 25 or 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inference I draw from those paragraphs is not only that the organisation was incompetent but also that it was quite obvious that those in charge of it had to have their arms twisted up their backs before they would give  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope the information he sought under his charter- a charter from the democratically elected government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the next few pages of his fourth report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope went on to say much about espionage, subversion, sabotage, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that a learned gentleman such as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope would have looked for a brighter star on which to hang his argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of that part of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s report reads something like an extreme right wing journal at the height of the Cold War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope goes on to talk about the type of weapons that a security service such as ASIO needs to operate- telephone taps, bugs or listening devices, mail interception et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest understatement in the whole report, in my view, comes on page 98 at paragraph 177 where  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is implementing in this legislation the basic reforms recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security led by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far the Senate has had a lot of quotations from the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope criticising the way in which some ASIO functions were previously carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of objectivity that I would like to have seen carried through into postwar Australia when Chifley appointed <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Reed as the first ASIO Director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I am breaking any security regulations in saying so, but at the instigation of the former Prime Minister I did have the opportunity of testifying before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and I say now that I do not mind a person on the Yarra bank in Melbourne or in the Domain in Sydney ranting on, as he is entitled to do, about what he thinks is wrong with society, but the fact is that in the history of Australia- and in this view I was buttressed by State and Commonwealth police testimony before the famous Townley Committee- no group on the left has used explosives, dynamite; but it has been used by people of the far right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead of the Northern Territory Supreme Court said that the north is open to terrorism and more surveillance is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead and I think his remarks were very timely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Muirhead is a very wise and aware person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Muirhead, of the Northern Territory Supreme Court, told the conference in Adelaide that one of the basic safeguards against terrorism was surveillance of suspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Muirhead has called for the setting up of a special branch once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed established and organised ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was asked to look into the situation and to report back to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt, many members of Parliament and interested Australians have read the eight reports presented by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope arising from the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope discusses at some length the ASIO situation and describes at some length subversion, sabotage, terrorism, security needs, disinformation, and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope spoke of subversion in his report and stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I refer to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said in regard to Australia’s security intelligence needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I suggest to the people who do show some concern, particularly about human rights, that in looking at  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s report and looking at the legislation that has been introduced one does find some variation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface, I refer to an extremely magnanimous gesture that I made three weeks ago in which I withdrew from the Notice Paper a motion which called for <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to be shown for interpreters and translators who are Commonwealth Bank employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The irony of this is that because of the inequalities in our society, including the system of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our society, those who commit offences, those who are caught committing offences and those who are penalised for committing offences are those who contribute to the poor-boxes and who frequently need to seek aid from the poor-boxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  made a statement on 21 August 1974 in which he announced that the Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive Council, had appointed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as a royal commissioner to inquire into Australia’s security and intelligence services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Prime Minister recalled that in his policy speech of 29 April 1974 he had given an undertaking that the Government would, if returned, appoint a judicial inquiry into the structure of the Australian security services, and the methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecting citizens or migrants and he said that the commission given to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope would fulfil both parts of his election promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The royal commission that was effectively conducted and reported upon by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was set up as a result of the policies of the Labor Party and in accordance with the decisions taken by the Labor Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949 Prime Minister Chifley set up the security organisation under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed for the purpose of giving Australia the security that would permit it to become a party to that agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone had the greatest confidence in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed but the first occasion on which I know of the security Act being imposed happened to involve myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only remedy was the courts, either through the uncertain and complex route of the prerogative writs in situations when the Administrator had acted either beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction or in breach of the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, or through specific court remedies created by the particular enabling legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, they have to depend on either the sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> or the compassion of adults to ensure that they are given the same protection as adults expect and normally obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to look back as far as 1853, when a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Supreme Court of Indiana said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if he cannot understand the implications of what was said by the <span class="highlight">justice</span> I have quoted that is his problem, not mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to name them because I might upset <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In keeping with the Government’s commitment to civil rights and administrative <span class="highlight">justice</span>, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also explain the position taken by the Government in this legislation in relation to withholding passports from persons generally known as ‘white collar criminals’ who are suspected of attempting to escape from <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a perusal of a sample of 41,000 dossiers,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White from South Australia said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were in line with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White’s general summation in his submission to the South Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that sort of activity that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has condemned out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know- Parliament is never told these thingswhether that was the reason for  Mr Barbour’s  change and for the subsequent appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the evidence from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and  Mr Wran’s  privacy committee is to the contrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether it is any wonder that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in summing up ASIO’s capacity for intelligence assessment, wrote so despairingly:  1 must report that I saw little evidence in ASIO that the qualities of mind and expertise needed were recognised, or available in any large measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made the comment, which I cannot put my finger on precisely at the moment, that legitimate political activity had to be protected at all costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  primary  aims of government, I suggest, should be three: security, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It endeavours to carry out the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do know that prior to the introduction of this legislation the Executive introduced some of the requirements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope which could be put into effect other than by legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at some of the things that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope spoke about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that some speakers have used quotations from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report simply to explain their own emotive viewpoints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has recognised ‘that a balance between the rights of individual persons and the preservation of the security of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely honourable senators opposite are not suggesting that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had not read or studied that evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all set out in the fourth report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the issue which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope faced and which the Attorney-General faced when he drew up this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was talking about the primary aims of government being security, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The definition of ‘subversion’ is perhaps one of the more difficult tasks that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations with respect to the domestic aspects of subversion, without spelling them out here in detail, it was clear that the concept of force or violence as an element in the notion of subversion- the concept of overthrowing the constitutional government, of unlawfulness in the activity involved or contemplated by the persons in question- was the basic flavour that emerges from his definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly regrettable that the definition of subversion, as it appears in the Bill before us, reaches much more widely than the explicit recommendations on page 41 of the first volume of the fourth report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject matter of our second and third amendments, which  Senator Button  foreshadowed, goes directly to the extension of the definition beyond that which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our first amendment goes to something which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did, in fact, recommend and which has been picked up unaltered in the Bill and that is the use of the expression ‘ultimately’ which appears in clause 5(1) (a). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the word ‘ultimately ‘ was not subject to any extended argument or analysis by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, and nor has any been offered during the second reading speech or anywhere else in the course of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular revolutionary groups  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope adverted to quite specifically in his report as having in their political platforms quite explicit revolutionary aspirations, were the Communist Party, the Socialist Party of Australia and the Communist Party of Australia Marxist-Leninist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope, in relation to the Communist Party, stated at page 47 of Volume I of the fourth report that the revolutionary objective of that party, as most recently reaffirmed in 1972 in the 23rd National Congress, had been expressed in its constitution the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether they are as good as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s recent best estimates but they are the ones usually accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, I carry no brief for the SPA, as a political party, but I believe that that is a realistic assessment of its revolutionary capabilities, notwithstanding the rather more extravagant rhetoric that is quoted in respect of its constitution by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the third body that attracts  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s explicit attention, at page 48 of the report in question, is the CPA(M/L), the China-line communist party which recently, of course, found itself split into two rather bitterly-opposed factions, with its barely 1,000 members divided between those who pledge undying loyalty to the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution and those- the larger group- who support the current more pragmatically-inclined Chinese leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is to be commended on presenting a comprehensive and detailed report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the reforms recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, including many of those already implemented by the Government, apparently have been successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general administrative improvements in training and recruitment of staff since the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no doubt due first to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope after the analysis he gave and in particular the very sober and responsible recommendations of his report; and secondly, to the large measures of reform of the organisation which have been undertaken by the present Director-General of the organisation,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First and foremost was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in a statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in October 1977, after having given a good deal of thought and study to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report, indicated that it would adopt substantially his recommendations and would be legislating in due course to give effect to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also accepted many other recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope which could be implemented without legislation and, as I said, a great many of the reforms recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope have been put into effect under the leadership of the organisation by the present DirectorGeneral,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has indicated- indeed, it is the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope- that matters relating to security, if possible and as far as possible, should be bipartisan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of a report to Parliament was very carefully considered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope; and he recommended against a report to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the legislation contains a provision, recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, that the Director-General of the Organisation should report to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Organisation has done so and the Government is of the view that that report should be made available to the Leader of the Opposition under conditions of secrecy- as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommended, on Executive Council conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Government is not prepared to include this in the legislation it is prepared to consider inviting  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope- providing he is available- to have a look at the Organisation on a future occasion, perhaps not in two or three years time but certainly within five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is prepared to ensure- we have always agreed with this in principle and it has been recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope- the statutory requirement that the Leader of” the Opposition will be given regular information and briefing about the Organisation by the Director-General and will also be given the annual report of the Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have come a long way in recent years under the leadership of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward as Director-General of the Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I know,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey has not yet ruled on that submission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of ensuring <span class="highlight">justice</span> and encouraging young unemployed people to seek job vacancies, will the Minister assure the Senate that a thorough investigation will be conducted into the activities of both the grape growers and the Mildura Commonwealth Employment Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have martial law administrators comment on the alleged guilt of an accused person in a country which is ruled by martial law can be regarded only as a severe abuse of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This resulted from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward ‘s inquiry into the land rights of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further on in the document the Council points to the decision made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey when, in considering Borroloola, he sets out the conditions that he thinks he must take into consideration as Aboriginal Land Commissioner under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation derives directly from the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Land Rights conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  A. E. Woodward in 1973 and 1974 which were accepted by all major political parties ‘, the Minister said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land claims of the Borroloola people have been a source of concern to them since  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey recommended the granting of only part of their claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1869 Archbishop Polding made a statement which was not repeated until a publication entitled  Aborigines, A Statement of Concern  was prepared by the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace for the Catholic bishops of Australia last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, then, we are held to compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>desire solemnly to lay upon the conscience of all who have property in these colonies the thought that there is blood upon their land, and that human souls, to whom they are in so many ways debtors, in the name of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and in the name of the Redeemer, are perishing because no man careth for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I am correct in saying that all the recommendations that have been made to government by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, have been agreed to by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  has found himself in the situation of being criticised from time to time for not following the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope ‘s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have no doubt that it will, but in order not to be too selective in the way in which one approaches this matter, it is proper to review what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of speakers have said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did not appear to have advanced very much reason for using that criterion or definition, but one can find this if one examines Volume 2 of the fourth report, and looks at the draft submission of the United States Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the testimony of the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 101 onwards  Mr Levi  appears to have quite substantially influenced the decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, and  His  Honour so indicates in paragraph 66 at page 40 of Volume 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that basically the use of the word ‘ultimately’ in paragraph (a) of clause 5 (1) is justified on the grounds that I have attempted to set forth; also, not only on the recommendation specifically made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope but also on the material upon which he has relied in arriving at that recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is the transgressions and the errors of judgment which have been made over the last 30 years that the Government claims, in response to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, that it wants to remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed that  Senator Puplick  took a less liberal view and is endeavouring to produce evidence based on what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not adopted all of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations in respect of this legislation so it is not necessary that we take the view that we are necessarily committed because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope or some other judicial authority overseas has expressed themselves about this or that particular aspect of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might also mention that, as has been pointed out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, there have been certain ASIO agents who have not acted in accordance with the charter of that Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are much wider in their text than anything that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommended that the definition of subversion should include the activities of persons directed to- I quote his words- ‘obstructing, hindering or interfering with the taking of measures by the Commonwealth Government in the interests of the security of Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a very general proposition by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and this particular limb of clause 5 ( 1 ) (b), which lends a little more particularity to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendation, is simply saying that the powers of the or- the activities of persons which are directed- I emphasise the word ‘directed’- to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions, or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purpose of the security or defence thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The powers are based broadly upon recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that those reports are based on statements made following the decision by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey to exclude Ayers Rock- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask: What are the reasons for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ‘s one-year appointment as  chairman  of the Academic Salaries Tribunal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, had  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Campbell not become Chancellor of the Queensland University, and therefore disqualified himself, there would have been continuity in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke is a very senior member of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and it was felt that one could not commit him for long periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we discussed this matter in the second reading stage of this debate some reference was made to the Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security and to the comments made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on the question of a bipartisan approach to security matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Senate again to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had to say on this specific matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the approach of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that suggestion by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is clearly that, if we feel that we have to have an organisation such as ASIO, then in the interests of the community it is desirable that it be accepted and respected as much as possible by as broad a spectrum of community opinion as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy was the Attorney-General he did not feel any great inhibition about answering a question in this Senate about the number of times- I do not think warrants were involvedASIO was allowed to make telephonic interceptions and how many interceptions of that kind were carried out in each of a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand, similarly, that the Leader of the Opposition was provided with details of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s inquiry, which were not otherwise made available to members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that because of the importance we attach to the conclusions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on the desirability of a bipartisan approach being adopted to the whole business of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact or which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope- rightly so in our view- emphasised throughout his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did not say- one rather wishes he had- is that the practice of adopting a nonbipartisan approach, the practice of not briefing the Leader of the Opposition on security matters, is one that regrettably was instituted by  Mr Menzies  in 1 950. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 365 of the first volume of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s fourth report- we will see in a moment that he had a couple of shillings each way on this particular controversy- he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope acknowledges, there was the accepted view that he had complete authority, powers of direction and access to records and premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intermediate view of ministerial responsibility in this respect advanced by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope summarised the position as he saw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we see the real disincentive for any tendency on the part of a Director-General to misuse his powers- and he is the one who will have access to these individual files- as being the notion of the judicial audit, the process of another spring cleaning job from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope or, in the case of South Australia,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White or somebody else every three years or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preamble to that clause reflects the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope on page 1 73 in paragraph 352 where he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no real quarrel with the preamble within clause 8 (2) because my approach to this legislation is that in general terms it is based on the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope who, having investigated the situation, was in the best position to make such recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of clause 8(2) presumably are an attempt to pick up the recommendations made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in paragraph 353 on page 173. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is as well, since we are dealing with this matter, to read  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendation in paragraph 353 states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to the point  Senator Harradine  has just raised, let me say that the Opposition has indeed noted and applauded the distinction between the text of the Bill and the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the few instances, as we see it, in which the Government has departed from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations in a more liberal rather than illiberal direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations as allowing too much room for limitation of the scope of ministerial power and responsibility, allowing too much residual authority to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I merely asked the question and since the Opposition has obviously noted and applauded the distinction between the text of the Bill and the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, let me be as specific as I was in my speech during the second reading debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise that because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself indicated that such an organisation was one about which there should be intelligent information, and I stress that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope obviously felt that there ought to be a very wide measure of independence by the Director-General in relation to his professional opinion, if I can put it in that broad sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the change in the wording of the Bill from that contained in the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope would mean that the Minister, on behalf of the government of the day, could direct the DirectorGeneral either not to collect intelligence about a particular organisation or to collect intelligence about an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although one may feel dubious as to whether the Minister should override the opinion of the Director-General about whether the Organization should collect intelligence about a particular organisation, the corollary of that is- if one accepts the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope- that the Government could not give a direction to the Organization that it should collect intelligence about a particular organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my speech on the second reading debate I referred to the fact that the recommendation in the fourth report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was that there should be a stated period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that in future short appointments might be made, and as 1 think that that is somewhat undesirable, I ask the Attorney-General why this particular recommendation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has been departed from? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his report, found that outside the areas of Commonwealth employment, immigration cases and Commonwealth contracts there was very little communication of intelligence relating to security, and that is why he advised that the appeal system should be confined to those cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Past experience on the relationship between the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and State special branches, for example, was a matter of very adverse comment by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we would appreciate some undertaking that it would be in legislative form; otherwise we can go right through this Bill and receive letters from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward telling us what a good fellow he is going to be, but it is not much help to any member of the public reading the legislation afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so far as the passage of information to State police forces by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and the relationship between those bodies are concerned, these things will be the subject of agreements which are being investigated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope as part of the inquiry that he has been undertaking for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission report of 1974 indicated that he could see no reason why areas should not be both owned as Aboriginal land and declared as national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the Environment and refer to the concept mentioned by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox of Kakadu National Park reaching stage 2, which would have included river catchment regions and would have embraced the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working party was assisted in its review by specialist reports from the Federal Co-ordinating Committee on the management aspects of the new arrangements and from  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Robinson on the operation of the port conciliator service established under the new arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review reports concluded that, generally speaking, the new arrangements have contributed to better performance in the stevedoring industry and that they have gone a long way towards meeting those difficulties identified by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Northrop as far back as February 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that having recently had the experience of the Withers affair, the Government would have taken notice of what had happened on that occasion and taken steps to ensure that, firstly, there was not a repetition of the Withers affair in the Western Australia redistribution and, secondly, that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only would be done but also would appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor states in his report that  Senator Withers  influenced the distribution commissioners in last year’s redistribution in Queensland to have the proposed name ‘Gold Coast’ changed back to Mcpherson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think we are entitled to say that not only has the Government got to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done but also that it appears to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  has said that one would have thought, after all the trouble this Government got into as a result of the last redistribution in another State, that it would have endeavoured strenuously to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> was not only done, as  Senator Gietzelt  put it, but also was seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> White in South Australia where it was demonstrated, one would have thought even to  Senator Durack  ‘s satisfaction, that the State apparatus is simply not to be relied upon in terms of willingness to observe sensitivities and civil liberties of the citizens in the respective States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis on which information has been accumulated by such State agencies has been made again a matter of public record not only by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White’s report but also by the evidence which was forthcoming by  Mr Salisbury,  the former Chief Commissioner of the South Australian Police, in the evidence he gave before the Mitchell inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relationship between ASIO and State police forces is to be the subject of agreements as a result of inquiries being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is not the duty of the Attorney-General, if he could do anything to curb whoever is responsible for this report, or refer it to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Staley)  to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done to this individual- that he is reinstated in the job from which he had no right to be dismissed- it would be appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed sympathy with the young fellow concerned, and I look forward to his cooperation in seeing that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done, that the man is re-installed in a position that he has displayed competence to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was quite explicitly acknowledged by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in the course of his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope went on to state: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a later section  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope goes on to talk about the absolute necessity for ASIO always complying with the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty we have is that we have not been told enough, either by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope or by anything the Attorney-General has offered us in this debate, to enable us to make any such judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what we have been told by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is that these powers should not be used when there is any possibility of the information which is being sought being obtainable by other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope made this point very clear at page 76 of the volume of the report from which I quoted previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not my words; they are the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that that stricture made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be observed by the Organisation in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is rather silent on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order that <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be done to everyone, I have tabled the supplementary submission of the Department of Social Security and I make clear my view that it presents a more civilised and appropriate response than that given in oral evidence eight months earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seven Ages: The <span class="highlight">Justice</span>- Sweden <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made it abundantly clear that that would be intolerable to social <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that steps must be taken to rectify the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters which surely ought not be left in the province of a public servant, certainly not in the province of an intelligence organisation which, as disclosed in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, admits grave dereliction of duty and grave breaches in carrying out its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do the Labor Party the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of believing that it also wants such an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have suspected that and would not have been surprised if, given the report of  Mr Acting  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White or anybody else, every member of this Parliament had some sort of dossier kept on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as this party learned from the independent judicial review of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and the other commissioners that its previous attitude towards the exportation of uranium was illfounded, so we have learned from the Hope report that our previous trust in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was equally unfounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in Volume I of the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, in dealing with this whole matter of interception, made a number of comments to which I would like to refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope nowhere gives us any indication of what he regards as urgent circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will let  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke know that a person of superior legal knowledge says it cannot hear it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the requirements of the injunction issued by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey are being observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the payment on the retirement of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> who has completed not less than 10 years’ service, or on the death of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> irrespective of whether he has completed 10 years’ service, of an amount calculated at the rate of 5.2 weeks for each completed year of qualifying judicial service or an amount equivalent to one year’s salary whichever is the lesser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If after 10 years a <span class="highlight">justice</span> retires or dies in office without having taken any long leave, he, his widow or dependants, as the case may be, shall be paid a sum equal to the amount of one year’s salary as at the date of his retirement or death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that in no circumstances will a payment under the Bill exceed an amount equal to a <span class="highlight">justice</span>’s annual salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If on the other hand a <span class="highlight">justice</span> should die in office before he completes 10 years’ service then an amount is payable calculated on the basis of 5.2 weeks for each year of his service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">justice</span> retires the payment is, of course, to be made to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> dies in office payment is made to the spouse or, if there is none, to his dependants, or in any other case to the legal personal representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides that where a payment is made to dependants of a deceased <span class="highlight">justice</span> the amount payable shall be distributed between or among those dependants as directed by the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, we are dealing with legislation which does not provide for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward to go on forever and it is important that the provisions in the legislation be as proper as they possibly can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia itself where, without adequate supervision and checks and balances of this kind, quite serious instances of abuse of the powers of an intelligence organisation have been found by, for example,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is willing to accept a suggestion made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report that there should be consultation with the Leader of the Opposition about these matters, I think it is only proper that it should accept the whole of the spirit of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did not refer only to consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is precisely the position which was adopted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister will tell us that the DirectorGeneral,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, will report to the Leader of the Opposition anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does last for a considerable period, as I said before, it ought to be correct in accordance with the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and embody the democratic checks, balances and safeguards to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the second half of the point which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was concerned about and the second half of the point about which we as an Opposition are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report refers to the provision of reports to the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is not a fool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White said when he looked at what happened in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After perusal of a small sample of the 4 1 , 000 dossiers held by the Special Branch in Adelaide, acting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> White reported having found ‘scandalously inaccurate opinions’ about the political standing of prominent citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-What the honourable senator is asking for is really quite a different right of appeal to the one which is being provided for in this clause and which was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope direct himself specifically to that problem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope at page 1 93 of the second volume of his fourth report dealt with this situation and stated that his recommendation did not include a number of people in respect of whom security intelligence is communicated for various purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After examining this aspect  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated in paragraph 25: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be some injustice in the situation where something that falls just short of being a security assessment under this definition is not covered by an appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was considered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, but he could not see that the legislation should cover the cases mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that this Bill is supposed to show some <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past there has been no <span class="highlight">justice</span> for many people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Missen  said,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope considered that aspect and his recommendation was that the area opened up too many other problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen  said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope examined this question and said that it was too difficult- indeed it was impossible- to answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was sympathetic about the matter, but he could not find a solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am indebted to  Senator Missen  for drawing attention to that section of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report in which  His  Honour confronted these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I note that among the problems that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope put in the ‘too hard’ basket was the matter of communications by the Commonwealth to State authorities which would have the effect of prejudicing State and local government employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular problem to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope did not find himself able to recommend a solution has apparently proved itself not to be beyond the Commonwealth Government’s resources of ingenuity because that is exactly the situation that is attempted to be dealt with in the proposed new clause 38a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One will realise that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his suggestions went further than the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  is going in this legislation because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said that decisions on this matter should be made by the Prime Minister himself, not by the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will deal, if I may, with both sub-clause (2) (a) and sub-clause (2) (b) in terms of departure in this legislation from the suggestions made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of subclause (2) (b), I note that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in fact indicated in paragraph 1 5 1 of the same volume that the decision to withhold the grounds contained in a security assessment could be made by either the Attorney or the Director-General of Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the proposal that there should be such a power of withholding this information certainly was recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepted fully the seriousness of this matter, emphasised as it was by that recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have harped on the point that there will be people from various ethnic communities seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the examples to which I have pointed about the system operating in Montreal and Quebec because 1 would not like to feel that a person is unduly delayed by <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one previous member of that committee, in the person of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McClelland, is now a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately they are qualities that are readily found in the judiciary of this country, as we have found with the two judges who have been intimately concerned with this legislation and this Organisation-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government to consider the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is <span class="highlight">justice</span> done and seen to be done when the accuser states a case and the accused is not to know of the accusations made against him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this does not fit into our system of British <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At times there have to be departures from the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commission’s concern that at times there have to be departures from the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am just not persuaded as yet by what I have seen of written material or what I have heard from the Attorney or any other spokesman on this, given the suggestions in the royal commission report and given the fact that the royal commissioner was sufficiently concerned to preface these remarks with the statement ‘at times there have to be departures from the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a departure from, I suppose, what has been understood as something so fundamental to the British style of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that is, the ability to know exactly what it is that one is accused of, exactly who it is that is making the accusations, and a complete ability to participate at a time that the accusations are made in a detailed refutation of those accusations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendation which, if implemented, would have gone a little further and given the Tribunal the power to decide this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We give away our normal forms of legal <span class="highlight">justice</span> where security is not at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not permit the Tribunal a discretion in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in cases in which there is no threat to security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot complain about that but in essential areas we take away from the Tribunal the right to decide whether there is a danger to security in giving the applicant the <span class="highlight">justice</span> that any other court would give him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether there is a  danger to  security or not, this Parliament says that he is not entitled to <span class="highlight">justice</span> normally extended under our system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament would not have to place a total prohibition upon the Tribunal to prevent all the injustices that can be done to someone who possibly has been wronged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give such a person all the <span class="highlight">justice</span> possible, we should place such a restriction on the power of the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third element in the scheme is that the presidential member of the Tribunal can, if he is satisfied that the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> outweigh the particular reasons specified by the AttorneyGeneral to justify his certificate, authorise the disclosure of the information or the contents of the document in question by the Tribunal to an applicant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal then is given no independent role to determine for itself whether the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> outweigh that particular reason and, accordingly, allow the disclosure of the material to the applicant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are fundamental basic natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal ought to be able to make its own decision on the basis of taking into account the security value on the one hand against the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the applicant having access to it on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that this is the very issue that was involved in the Sankey case where the High Court took the view that it was appropriate for a judicial tribunal to make its own mind up whether the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in a particular case were such as to outweigh the interests in maintaining the freedom from disclosure of Cabinet deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> which are the very statutory criteria laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to put into the record what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope had to say on this matter in his second report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For persons who remain in Australian Government employment, these security assessments, if incorrect, may remain a potential source of injustice in their careers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overseas experience suggests that there may not be many of these cases where the person involved will want to take any action about it, but <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires that a person whose reputation has been unjustly affected in this  way should be entitled to apply to have his name cleared and should be entitled to seek to have the record put right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that in all the departures that this Bill contains from the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope this is probably one of the most, if not the most, significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then expressed my concern that this proposal had moved so far away from the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 63(3) states that when the tribunal has made findings the Minister shall, subject to the requirements of security, take or cause to be taken such action in relation to these findings, by way of communication or publication of the findings or alteration of records, as he considers appropriate in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they have described in eloquent terms the intellectual processes by which one comes to the conclusion that the Opposition’s amendment or, indeed,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s proposal for some right of review of retrospective assessments should be accorded in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation which I have described really seems to indicate the bumble footed approach on behalf of the ASIO agent, of which there have been plenty of examples, many of which are recorded in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope investigated the allegations that were made publicly in that respect, and subjected that episode to some stinging criticism in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that, since both the publication of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s report and the introduction of this piece of legislation, the operations of the Organisation are in far more rational hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in relation to this matter is that the report should be given on Executive Council conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other parts of this legislation he has been entrusted, in accordance with the suggestions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and in accordance with the arguments that we have put, with information which might be important and which might be highly secret, with no such provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the Leader of the Opposition, in the spirit of bipartisanship about which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope wrote and which largely seems to have eluded the Government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the report that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope envisages as constituting the annual report of ASIO will be something that contains material which of its very nature is critical to the operations of the security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lies very squarely within the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s view in relation to a report to Parliament is based really very much upon  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s findings in regard to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>( 1 ) As soon as practicable after 30 June 198 1, and as soon as practicable after every three succeeding years, following the year ending 30 June 1981, a Judge holding the rank of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory or of the Federal Court shall be appointed to inquire into and report to the Minister upon: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It suggests that every three years a judge holding the rank of a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory or of the Federal Court should be appointed to inquire into and report to the Minister upon several matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of the past, including experience of intelligence agencies overseas and the experience of ASIO itself, is recorded by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is carried out by someone such as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, who has been closely involved with the Organisation, it can be done with a small amount of disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience gained from the investigation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was that the inquiry required a tremendous amount of servicing and attention from the Organisation itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my reply to the second reading debate, the Government is prepared to invite  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, if he is available, to have a look at the way the Organisation is operating within a few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see that as a sensible and desirable course and one which, because of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s considerable experience in and knowledge of the Organisation, would not have the major disruptive effects that would occur if the Opposition’s amendment were agreed to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that only half of the reports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope have been made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope rejected that proposal and the Government has rejected it as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are really left with at the moment is a somewhat vague promise that in three years or so  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope may look again at this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would not need the type of investigation which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope undertook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 admit that the mere renewal of the legislation might not be such a major task as the initial preparation because of the very extensive investigation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and the fact that it was the first time that such an inquiry had been conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope investigated these questions over a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the interests of social and commercial <span class="highlight">justice</span>, will the Minister request the Treasurer to introduce progressively a uniform level of excise for all alcoholic beverages in Australia, the rate of excise being proportional to the percentage of alcohol in the product? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the AttorneyGeneral ‘s attention been drawn to Press reports indicating that the Government might be considering either buying or building an official residence for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> when the High Court of Australia moves to Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has considered this question and has decided not to provide a residence for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia either in Canberra or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware there is no precedent for the provision of such a residence for a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in any common law countries and the Government sees no j justification  for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the case that the Government of the United States of America has made a decision to take up or espouse the Dillingham case before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and accordingly to sue Australia in that forum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that meeting did the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Attorney-General,  Mr Lickiss,  argue for the Queensland Government having exclusive jurisdiction over certain areas of the reef? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Prime Minister has taken a great interest in the matter I raise, I ask the Attorney-General: Does the Government intend to introduce further legislation to extend the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-At-Large for Nuclear Affairs, covering non-proliferation and safeguard matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few minutes ago I gave notice that tomorrow I shall introduce a Bill to amend the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act, which is designed to enable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox to accept appointment as an ambassador-at-large and to preserve his judicial status and office during the period he is such an ambassador. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that Bill will simply extend the application of the existing Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act to cover the new situation of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extension of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment would be part of the terms and conditions of his appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as certain minimum standards of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, social welfare and income guarantees are applicable to Australian citizens, in our view they should also be applicable to the people of Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we say that the desirability of encouraging the maximum degree of selfgovernment should be qualified by the very real interests of the Australian people as a whole, including those of Norfolk Island, in relation to tax matters and the provision of certain minimum standards of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and levels of income such as we seek in this Parliament, in numerous other debates, to guarantee by one means or another to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  is saying that it would be left to the islanders to make the application and that when an injustice occurs the people of the island would then have access to some arbitration procedure or some umpire to whom they could appeal for a determination as to whether an award should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it mean that provisions may later be enacted for the purpose of preventing industrial disputes or giving wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to workers on the island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  would be entitled to feel there is no <span class="highlight">justice</span> if  Senator Webster  remains as a Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the case that the United States Government- our one great friend, as the Minister put it- will be suing Australia for $23m or more in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for Australia’s supposed unlawful expropriation of Dillingham operations on Fraser Island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to remove doubts that have arisen as to whether, as a matter of law, the provisions made by section 3 of the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1977 in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s service and salary while performing the functions of AmbassadoratLarge apply to his service under extensions of the original term of his appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s term of appointment was extended from the original period of 12 months for a period of a little more than two months in October 1978 and for a period of some further five months in January 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now proposed, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has agreed, that his term be further extended from 8 June, when his present extension will expire, until the end of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The doubts that have arisen are legal, technical matters and the Government feels that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s rights should not be left in any doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on the 1977 legislation I stated that we did not then know for how long  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox would be engaged on his work as Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience has proved that this statement was correct and it has already been found desirable to extend  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox ‘s appointment beyond the initial period of 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work on which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been engaged as Ambassador-at-Large for nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards is, in the view of the Government, work of great national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late last year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox led the Australian delegation to the mid-term plenary conference of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will be able to make his own special contribution to policy in all these fields and will be an invaluable adviser to the Government on nuclear matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, the present Commissioner, has expressed the view that the Minister has the power to accept all or part of a Land Commissioner’s recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward made clear in his original recommendations in respect of Aboriginal land rights that in his opinion the amounts paid ought to be taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in line with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s recommendations and, of course, it is a reasonable thing in the light of the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From  Senator Messner’s  approach to the Fitzgerald report, one might believe that it is not beauty which is in the eye of the beholder but <span class="highlight">justice</span> which is in the eye of the beholder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this on any basis of <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Friday in Brisbane, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia rejected the Australian Wheat Board’s submission that the wheat marketing case was settled and committed  Ubergang’s  case for hearing in the full High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 now ask the Minister: Is it true that the Commonwealth has argued that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke of the Academic Salaries Tribunal did not have power in this area and therefore the dispute is still unresolved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Mr <span class="highlight">justice</span>  Ludeke in effect has reserved his judgment; that he is scratching his head on the matter at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister can explain the implications of a paragraph appearing in a judgment given by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to a recent deportation case which stated:  lt was relevant that  Mr  Pochi’s  liability to deportation depended in part upon an apparent failure by the Department of Immigration and Ethic Affairs to advise him that a grant of citizenship had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We and the pensioner community of Australia believed that there was a likelihood that the Government, in bringing down a mini-Budget, would decide to restore <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the area of age pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is deplorable in some of the States where the State inspectorate is responsible to the Department of Labor and the Department, being an employer of many people in the States, therefore is censured by one of its own employees; in other words, Caesar is trying to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Caesar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware that judges such as  Sir Owen  Dixon and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell have drawn attention to the fact that section 92 of the Constitution is defective in not referring to Territories such as the Australian Capital Territory, and that this matter has been raised at the Constitutional Convention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have the new High Court of Australia building, the cost of which has been expanded by some $7m at the personal whim of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who would have received also, pursuant to the position he occupies, a country seat had the Press and the Labor Party not exposed to the public what was going on a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> in terms of an increased share because of productivity and other factors and looking at the wage structure in terms of coping with increased costs, this certainly would be one sensible and logical way of combating inflation and allaying increases for wage demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that on this occasion  Senator Rae’s  comments do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the responsibilities of the Senate and that they will certainly be noted by the Industrial Relations Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was heard before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Davies earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it claims, with some <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that more help is needed from Canberra to enable the job to be completed within a reasonable period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister and his officers have immediate talks with  Mr Syd  Einfield, the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, in regard to the denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> by Grace Bros Pty Ltd of Sydney and its assessors, K. M. Miller of 189 Kent Street, Sydney, to the people who suffered severe scalds when hot coffee escaped from a type of airpot imported from Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This position was confirmed after the meeting by the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr Lickiss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to pervert <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if that is the term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Adelaide  Advertiser,  which is no supporter of the Labor Party, has said that there is great <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the South Australian Government’s claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek some information about what will happen following the handing down in Queensland yesterday by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Matthews of a judgment in relation to the payment of award wages to Aborigines on the various reserves in Queensland and those who live off the reserves and who are covered by the relevant Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Matthews of the industrial court said in his judgment: ‘Awards have the force of law and confer material and significant rights on employees entitled to the benefit of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Matthews ruled on the question of construction of a Queensland law, he was able to avoid ruling on the application ofthe Commonwealth legislation, the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, which was enacted by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and I are aware that the  President  of the Queensland Industrial Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Matthews, has handed down his decision that the State does not have the power to pay below award wages to Aboriginals living on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if there is any single thread linking together and explaining these various matters of concern to the Opposition, it is the personality and behaviour of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Garfield  has dominated the High Court like a colossus since his appointment as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> fresh from the ranks ofthe coalition Ministry in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s opinionsvery often they have been lone, dissenting opinions- have not been such as to attract that kind of intellectual hero worship with which one associates, for better or for worse, the tenure of  Sir Owen  Dixon as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s crustiness, if I may use a relatively neutral word, on and off the bench is legendary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not too late to cavil about the extraordinary escalation in the building’s original cost which is directly attributable, if I may say so with the utmost respect, to the personal meddling of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all accounts the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> not only was associated initially with the selection of the building design but also, ever since its construction began, has been playing about with it rather like an eight year old child with a mechano set, taking a bit off here, putting a bit back there, redesigning this, fiddling with that- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To talk of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court as an eight year old child, I think, is not upholding the dignity of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps he could moderate his language to indicate what has been done without reflecting upon the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional cost which has been attributable directly to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s engagement in the matters relating to the detail of building design- if I may use that circumlocution- has been acknowledged by the Government, in answers to questions put in this place, to be $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the kind specified by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> was obtainable, perhaps understandably enough, only in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third figure, which has been referred to and acknowledged specifically by this Government is $650,000 for the refinishing of walls and ceilings in the main court rooms in timber panelling rather than, as was part of the original design, finished concrete- finished concrete apparently not being posh enough for  Sir Garfield  Barwick and his brother justices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the available information one fears that if it becomes a choice for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> between library and research staff or a sea of liveried flunkies around the place, the choice would be all too enthusiastically for the latter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only glimmer of hope in this respectsince 1 have been critical of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in what I have said so far let me balance it with a plaudit where it is due- has been the introduction of the biennial speech by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> on ‘The State ofthe Australian Judicature’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the Court, and in particular the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, believe in giving out only that information which is regarded as ‘appropriate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> seems to believe in giving out information only on his own terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have reason to suspect that the real reason I did not get this information was a desire on the part of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to ensure that no questions be answered which would expose to public and parliamentary scrutiny - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in the material that 1 have had before me orin anything that has been said by the Government which dissuades me from the belief that there has been direct personal intervention by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> to stop the communication of this basic and straightforward information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may not be as noble as the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> might have aspired to have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us, I believe, on this occasion should pay tribute to those who over the decades have sought to have this Court in Canberra, and not least to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the present Justices who have spurred us to see that within not so many years- three or four- the principal seat of the High Court, a noble seat, will be at the seat of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This person is frightened to take the matter before the law courts to obtain <span class="highlight">justice</span> because of the threat that has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I leave the matter with you,  Mr President,  in full confidence that you will do all possible to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Acting Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gibbs, said: lt is in all cases the duty of the court, and not the privilege of the executive government, to decide whether a document will bc produced or may be withheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court must decide which aspect of the public interest predominates, or in other words whether the public interest which requires that the document should not bc produced outweighs the public interest that a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in performing its functions should not bc denied access to relevant evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the  Sydney Morning Herald  of 1 May 1979, the following report on the comments  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels, an appeal judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court, appeared: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to quote  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels as saying about  Mr Walker:  he had, it would seem, been misled by incorrect advice from his departmental advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Samuels was reported to have said that in relation to the effect of the Sankey decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it is potentially more destructive of civil rights, <span class="highlight">justice</span> and democracy than many other laws and activities that the Attorney-General is so ready to attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I recall correctly, the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court was a losing advocate in that particular decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, with the passage of years, we have a situation in which the current High Court Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> seems to be the leader in a situation in which it is almost impossible for the Commissioner of Taxation to win a case before the court in matters of tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Thursday in Brisbane the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia, who is, of course, notorious for attempting to refer back to the court all previous judgments that have gone against him, in a different case, the Uebergang case, ruled against the Wheat Board and decided that the Full Court would hear Uebergang ‘s appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance he is referring the case to the Full Court knowing that there has been another appointment since then, that <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Wilson could be expected to support him and that one of the other justices who did not sit on the earlier Clark King Case will also support him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) Did the Government, in August 1976, suspend the activities of the Northern Territory Interim Land Commissioner, the late  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  R. C. Ward, with regard to his hearing Aboriginal needs claims to town and other areas in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward’s activities were suspended, what was the then status of each claim referred to in (3) above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement on 8 August 1976, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs stated, inter alia, that ‘a number of applications by Aboriginals for land in town areas, which had been submitted to the Interim Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, arc now being dealt with jointly by my Department and by the Department of the Northern Territory”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 ) to ( 7 ) I understand that the ‘ freeze ‘ in respect of the 2 1 specified areas was extended to 3 1 December 1 976 following a recommendation to that effect by the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ward, in a land claim report of 10 September 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer to that Committee as the Franki Committee, in recognition of its distinguished  Chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish, at this point, to express the Government’s gratitude to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Franki and to members of the Committee for the service which they have rendered to the community in this most difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the object of the legislation is to ratify, as it were, any irregularities about the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large on nuclear matters, the Opposition is not concerned to oppose it, and it does not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that is quite clearly and simply that the view of the Opposition is that there must be a clear understanding of the duration of this appointment and there should perhaps be more reporting to the Parliament about the cost of the appointment and, of course, the effectiveness of the activities of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the concerns which are now the subject of a question on the Notice Paper to the Government are to ascertain the total cost of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s mission, if I might call it that, in the financial year 1977-78 and from 1 July 1978 to date; more particularly, to find out some of the details of those costs in terms of air travel, accommodation, transport for both  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and his wife and salaries of persons concerned with his mission; and, more importantly, to find out the estimated cost of the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox up to 31 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read the article and have had discussions with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that six months after the publication of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s paper a question was asked by  Mr Lionel  Bowen of  Mr Peacock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is concerned about is that there should be answers to these questions as well as to the fundamental question of whether or not  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is being used as a device by which the Government can defuse questions about its nuclear policy, and particularly about arrangements such as that entered into with South Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By having  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox in this itinerant capacity the Government can point to him as a symbolic figure of good endeavour travelling around the globe but at the same time indulge in policies in Australia which in fact ignore both the symbolism and the reality of his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already indicated, the work in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is engaged is expected to conclude towards the end of 1980 and he has been reappointed until 31 December 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox was not made by legislation, I think the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  has indicated that it can be terminated by this legislation because he admitted that the Government did not wish to be bound to that termination date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be unfair to suggest this, but it is possible that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox may create the conditions for his further appointment if we have an open-ended arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s amendment endeavours to make it clear to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and to the Government that the appointment will terminate in three years time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically in answer to  Senator Button  I point out that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s original appointment was extended from October 1978 until 17 January 1979, from then until 8 June 1979 and then until 31 December 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to  Senator Georges,  and to answer the general criticism of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, an analogy with other appointments that judges have held as royal commissioners, is rather different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has a specific executive appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw  Senator George’s  attention to page 2 of my second reading speech where I set out the work that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These activities will continue in the international sphere, whether or not  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox is Australia’s Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for our participation in them that we require the services of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, and I think we are fortunate that we have been able to persuade him to continue his role in this work in which he has become expert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite the reverse of any concern that the Committee might have that the work is being created by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see little or no <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Kilgariff  can assure me that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be done, I will say very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, this inquiry was carried out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason or other,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox did not at any stage touch on the constitutional changes that were developing side by side with the proposal to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an unusual situation and I can only assume that if the attention of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox had been drawn to the constitutional changes taking place in the Territory, there would have been some reference in the report which came from the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the obvious racial discrimination involved in the low wages currently being paid to the non-European employees of the British Phosphate Commission on Christmas Island, will the Minister recommend that the Federal Government become a party to the pending arbitration case involving these employees to ensure that they enjoy wage <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recommended by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, the health and environmental aspects of uranium mining are regulated under applicable Northern Territory law but the supervising scientist for the Alligator Rivers region, who is appointed under Commonwealth statute, has an overall supervisory and co-ordinative role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Judge presiding over the Court of Disputed Returns,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the finding of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith at the time he brought down his report in late 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only malpractice which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith discerned was an organised Liberal Party campaign of malpractice of which the architects were the Liberal Party’s Kimberley luminaries, Broomhall, O’Driscoll and Rowell, but which ultimately involved three Ministers of the Western Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is exemplified by an article in the Melbourne  Age  of 17 November 1978 which reported the findings by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith in the Court of Disputed Returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that electors may be enrolled only if their application for enrolment is witnessed by a person coming within one of the following four categories: An electoral officer; a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace; a clerk of courts; or a policeman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only two categories of people with whom Aborigines in the remote parts of the State are likely to come into contact are justices of the peace and policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 18 (3) (c), which concerns directions by the presiding officer to voters who present themselves to vote, is a provision that the Opposition believes is open to abuse if misinterpreted in the way that provisions of the existing Act were deliberately misinterpreted by the Chief Electoral Officer, on instructions from the Minister of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Attorney-General, in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the amendment fails to provide for what was one of the key findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith in his Court of Disputed Returns judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been possible to state explicitly in the Act that the presentation of a how to vote card is, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith found, sufficient indication of the elector’s intention to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the recommendations of the electoral inquiry of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay were based on the suppositions that manipulation and malpractice were widespread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No evidence has been presented to the Kay inquiry, the Court of Disputed Returns presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith, to Parliament or in the libel case involving  Mr Tozer  that such manipulation and malpractice exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was found by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith to have improperly influenced another Minister to instruct the Chief Electoral Officer to dispatch a telegram to attendants and presiding officers at Kimberley polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer again to the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith referred to a marginal notation on a letter written by  Mr Mclntyre  to the Minister which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith says that  Mr McIntyre  could not recall advising the Minister in these terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I quote from what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith had to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response of the Premier,  Sir Charles  Court, when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith’s judgment was handed down was, firstly, to reject it out of hand and to say that it was the opinion of one man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith’s finding concerning the Attorney-General,  Mr Medcalf, Sir Charles  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reporting on the proceedings in the Court of Disputed Returns presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith the  West Australian  newspaper of 26 August 1 977 had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay was that people who speak Aboriginal languages should be used at polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of information has been put before the Senate, including extracts from the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith relating to the Kimberley election which gave rise to the Kimberley by-election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators would expect, I have already received Aboriginal views on the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay, to which I would like to refer briefly, is something I think many honourable senators might take the trouble to examine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay’s report repays reading in that it draws attention to the fact that there are simple, practical difficulties which have to be faced and which do permit the possibility of manipulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay’s report brings out very well is the fact that, in various ways, it is possible to manipulate the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under various headings in the report, for example, with respect to the enrolment of voters,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay made out his case as to why he believed it was necessary for some form of authorised witness to witness an application or a claim for a right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay pointed out in his report, that under the law as it stands at present a person who cannot read or write can be a witness to an electoral claim, not knowing what is in the card and possibly having no knowledge of the Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay pointed out that that presented an opportunity for manipulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer very quickly to page 31 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay’s report for his comments on postal votes, which again 1 think are useful in pointing out the differences between the States and the difficulties of ensuring, when a marksman is involved, that one is getting a vote from the person who is claimed to have his name on the electoral roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 33 of the report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay made a statement of principle which I think we could all consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the various suggestions which have been put forward,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith, for whom I have the highest regard, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kay, for whom I have the highest regard also, have each put forward different views on how one can get over that problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry chaired by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox perceived the contrary- the utterly different context of the late 1970s as distinct from the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After about six months experience I would welcome a studyprobably it would be best carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations- into the working of the appeals proceedings in this area to see whether they are really meeting fairly the proper needs of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there will be a period during which the previous regulations will be applicable, but if they are then disallowed by this Parliament it will at least import to them <span class="highlight">justice</span> or fairness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this must be an abuse of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next suggestion I make is that we introduce an acceptable appeals system which will meet the criteria of openness, fairness and letting <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done and being seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs which is headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams will be kept informed, but this is a police investigation of alleged criminal offences and the final decision in relation to those proceedings is made by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although this notion of Commissioner Salisbury was, of course, promptly and effectively quashed by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Roma Mitchell in her royal commission report on the Salisbury dismissal, it is apparent that it is a view-I put it, respectfully, in this way- that has some considerable currency in conservative establishments around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concern that many of us have is that the ABC, because of its very great capacity to influence the views of a lot of people, has a special responsibility to ensure balance and <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the programs which it produces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The enormity of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> ‘s finding in this matter was dramatised in two contemporary comments made by Federal Liberal politicians, both lawyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the next brazen demonstration of political bias the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> went beyond emasculating those sections of the Constitution which do not suit his purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the legal assertion of his cousin, who is a former Solicitor-General and Attorney-General, is correct, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s advisory opinion to  Sir John  Kerr in 1975 was actually illegal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That assertion by the Chief Justices ‘s cousin, a former Solicitor-General and Attorney-General, blows apart the excuse offered by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at the National Press Club on 10 June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When asked by journalists about the legality of his advisory opinion, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> replied: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But anyone who comprehends simple English can see that the assertions by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and his cousin are mutually exclusive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the very least the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’s action was legally arguable but that did not deter him from pressing for and sanctioning the most provocative, enduring and divisive political action Australia has known since the conscription fracas of World War I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I instance the varying statements by the South West African People ‘s Organisation- SWAPO - about Australia ‘s participation; the opening of a South African based National Assembly in Namibia during May; South Africa’s announced plans for Namibian independence; certain activities by the United Nations General Assembly in May, including the appointment of another ambassador to deal with the matter; the Lusaka decisions relating to Zimbabwe; and the replacement of the liberal Administrator of Namibia,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Martin Steyn, by the  chairman  of the archreactionary Broederbond of South Africa, Professor Girret Viljoen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 7 August  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers in the Federal Court made orders against the gentleman who did style himself as the charge d’affaires of the Croatian embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smithers made some detailed orders on 7 August but suspended the implementation of them for 2 1 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think that all High Court judges, with the exception of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, have been appointed on the basis of those arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has said that this is a compassionate Budget, and I assume that she based that statement on the fact that the Government has decided to restore <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the pensioners of this country by reintroducing twice-yearly indexation, which should not have been removed last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1973 Medical Fees Tribunal under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  J. T. Ludeke discontinued the practice of lower Tees for Items 3330-3346 (removal of keratoses, warts or similar lesions) when these services were provided by nonspecialist practitioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-No doubt  Senator Button,  since he would not take notice of the views of either the Prime Minister or  Mr Street,  would of course take notice of the views of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Sir John  Moore and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that the previous Coal Industry Tribunal,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher, served as a judge of the New South Wales Industrial Commission from 1955 to 1957 and for many years from 1957 as a  Deputy President  of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions enabling  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher’s dual appointments were in the Coal Industry Act 1955 and the Coal Industry Act 1957 but those provisions referred specifically to Francis Heath Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should such an appointment be made the Tribunal would be required to give priority to coal industry matters as was the case with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The necessity for the Minister and for other officers to be alert, given the fact that they will be supplied with information about the number of warrants that have been issued, will mean that in the long run the safeguard of the proper use of this legislation will lie in the integrity and the competence of a Minister of the Crown, the Minister for Customs of the day, and in the way in which the Parliament, through him, exercises its supervision over officers of the Crown acting in pursuit of their responsibilities to bring narcotic offenders to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that sort of behaviour that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred to in his voluminous report which was presented to the Parliament last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as has been shown in the investigation carried out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, there have been flagrant breaches of that process in the collection of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a continuation of the very processes to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware of what happened in respect of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White’s report and of how the names of a great number of ordinary citizens were put on lists which could be described only as lists of the names of people engaged in legitimate political activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investigation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, although we do not agree with all of his recommendations, was of itself an indication of the value of this kind of independent judicial scrutiny of and report on a particular security agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened in South Australia with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White and the cleaning up of that extraordinary mess that was the South Australian Special Branch indicated how important it was for the government of the day to know what was taking place in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, which was presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, by and large accepted those powers and indeed recommended some additions to those powers in other respects, such as listening devices, all of which have been dealt with in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which passed through the Senate some months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope recommended that as far as ASIO’s power is concerned, the legislation should be updated and expanded only to apply it to all modern forms of telecommunications, not limiting it as existing powers are to communications over the telephone system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it is not the function of the Minister to answer for the report that is before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those reasons is that it might be helpful to this legislature to have the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ Royal Commission on Drugs before this legislation is considered in depth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister in the House of Representatives said: ‘Well,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has no objection to this legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams-  more so than the NSW inquiry, has laid to rest the often officially inspired myth that there is no evidence of organised crime involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, I think speaking on behalf of the Court, was at some pains to draw attention to the fact that there needed to be a clear distincion between the grounds of proof in civil and criminal matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we compare the United States with countries that are known to have the most advanced and most humane criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> systems in the world, the differences are striking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1967, the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> observed that, despite stiffened penalties, the use of and traffic in (marihuana) appear to be increasing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first report of the South Australian Criminal Law and Penal Methods Reform Committee entitled ‘Sentencing and Corrections’ under the chairmanship of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mitchell again close attention was drawn to the problem whether a government, in enacting a punitive statute, has to have with it a coherent philosophy about what it is that it is trying to achieve, not just for the persons who are involved in the crime, but for the people who might be victims of crimes and might be, in fact, the ones about whom the community should have greatest concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally in this regard I think it would be wise for people concerned with the whole issue of sentencing and the whole issue of the effectiveness of penalties to look at what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby had to say in his John Barry Memorial Lecture delivered earlier this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that most perceptive address  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby draws attention to one particular characteristic which he expresses in relation to  Sir John  Barry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On one occasion in about the early 1970s when we were dealing with certain aspects of Department of Immigration estimates, I moved an amendment with the blessing of my then leader who is now an illustrious member of the High Court, the then senator but now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Under section 3 of the Judiciary ( Diplomatic Representation) Act 1977,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox retains the annual salary and allowance that he would have had as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox’s appointment as AmbassadoratLarge comes to an end, he will retain his position as a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia and will be entitled to salary and annual allowance on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perhaps superfluous for me to reiterate the general attitude of Australians towards those who were collaborators, traitors and war criminals and who have been pursued and brought to <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in order to lend <span class="highlight">justice</span> to a consideration of the matter, and injustice to the individual concerned, that I seek their incorporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude which Chamberlain and, to a lesser extent, Daladier and other Western leaders took at that time was, first of all, that there was some <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the case; that there were imperfections within Czechoslovakia; that the Treaty of Versailles had not been correct in incorporating German inhabitants, predominantly of Sudetenland, within Czechoslovakia; and, more than that, that this was a way of obtaining peace, that sacrificing this small country- I think the words, if I may paraphrase them, of  Mr Chamberlain  at that time were: ‘A little country a long way away which few of us know anything about’somehow or another would mean an end of the designs of Nazi Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way in which <span class="highlight">justice</span> and peace will be achieved in South Africa is if there is some sort of consensus between the white populationthe dominant, overwhelmingly powerful white population- and the non-white population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If indeed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams and his Royal Commission are prepared to endorse these powers, these procedures, I for one would have wished to have seen a well-reasoned, argued case from that source in support thereof before having to debate legislation in the way that we are now obliged to, by the Government’s having brought it forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An old saying that he has repeated time and again is that <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only has to be done but also has to be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That life sentence is imposed infrequently, lt is a very fundamental rule of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> in Australia that, when the Parliament or the common law lays down a penalty, that is a maximum penalty and not one which the courts are obliged to impose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in another place, has indicated that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, the Royal Commissioner, has been made aware of the Government’s intentions to proceed with this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said that the last thing in the world that this Government, and certainly this Senate, would want to do would be to harm any person in seeking <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and that I would defer the matter in order to get legal advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 250 he refers to the opinion expressed in 1937 by  Sir Frederick  Jordan, the then Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Frederick  said:  lt is of extreme public interest that no conduct should be permitted which is likely to prevent a litigant in a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span> from having his case tried free from all matter of prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, important though it undoubtedly is, is not the only matter in which the public is vitally interested; and if in the course of the ventilation of a question of public concern matter is published which might prejudice a party in the conduct of a law suit, it does not follow that a contempt has been committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is considering and weighing up the matter by reference to fairness, <span class="highlight">justice</span> or considerations of that kind, what we ought to be doing - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it started in 1977, as recently as January of this year the British Government accepted a report in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Parker stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I am no lawyer, at that point the only recourse I had in the interests of <span class="highlight">justice</span> was to seek a period in which to check whether this may or may not be true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Labor Opposition is not interested in natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, in ordinary <span class="highlight">justice</span>, for the individual or for the community as a whole does not invalidate what I am saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby appeared before one of the Government committees a few nights ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statute proposals in detail come forward from the Law Reform Commission which has established, under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, a most enviable reputation for the amount of consultation, work, thought and argument that goes into its proposals, is a most worthwhile initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> itself ought to be uniform for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope’s recommendations with regard to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation did not favour such a full accountability to a Minister as the ASIO legislation provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said in my remarks on the earlier amendment that any particular schedule or tariff of penalties inevitably means that some people will be on the wrong side of the line and may suffer an injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In broad terms the Government believes that <span class="highlight">justice</span> will be better done in this judicial fashion than by adopting amendments such as the ones proposed here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer  Senator Evans  and any other senators who may be interested in pursuing the legal niceties of this subject to some very valuable dicta by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullagar, in Jackson v. Butterworth 1946, which is contained in the Victoria Law Reports at page 332. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullagar was talking about the standard of proof in recovery of penalties under taxation proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He quoted some very well known dicta of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon, as he then was, in Briginshaw v. Briginshaw on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon said because it is apposite to the point that  Senator Evans  has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon said that a court in deciding on the standard of proof in these matters will have regard to the seriousness of the allegation made and the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was reported in the Hobart  Mercury  of 3 April this year that the writ alleged that her pension was cancelled in October, 1977, and that this cancellation was upheld in reviews by Messrs Wraith and Lanigan; that in December 1977 she reapplied for a pension, but again this was refused by  Mr Wraith  and  Mr Lanigan;  that the reviews were contrary to the principles of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>’; that she was not informed of the grounds for cancellation of the pension; and that she was not given the proper opportunity to advance argument and make submissions about why the pension should not be cancelled and why it should not be refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only other alternative is for the hundreds or thousands of women in this community who are deprived of their pensions in these circumstances to take out High Court writs to get <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that this very difficult area- I admit that is is a difficult area- be cleared up so that <span class="highlight">justice</span> can be done and be seen to be done for the many women involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs seen a document which was put out by the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the case of the medical profession, when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke requested information from the AMA about doctors’ salaries and earnings, he was told that it could not be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally,  Senator Button  was inaccurate when he said that there was no requirement before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke for disclosure of information on doctors’ earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a quote from a document prepared by the Catholic Commission on Peace and <span class="highlight">Justice</span> which was published recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances, the Committee has agreed that it would not be able to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the inquiry if it attempted to rush through a report simply to meet the deadline contained in the resolution of appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such is the concern in the community now that many economists, organisations such as the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, many people in universities and even many people who generally can be described as conservative in their thinking are beginning to show some signs of concern about what is happening in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me begin with the question of injustice or immorality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the best known statement of it is that of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Owen  Dixon in the case of Maxwell v. Murphy in the High Court in 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That point was made clearly by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Isaacs, as he then was, in the case of George Hudson Ltd v. The Australian Timber Workers Union in the High Court in 1923, when he said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no remedial Act which does not affect some vested right, but, when contemplated in its total effect, <span class="highlight">justice</span> may be overwhelmingly on the other side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This morning 1 referred honourable senators to a report from the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace to the Catholic bishops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the facts and figures provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service and contained in the report prepared by the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, it is clear that  Mr Viner  ‘s State has the highest percentage of unemployed in one area of anywhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the very good work of the organisation presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Leycester Meares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we uphold the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the decision of the Committee, one in which we have confidence, and which made the decision on expert advice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not indicate whether we should let the elected Parliament take control or whether, despite the extent to which we have gone in trying to fathom the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the matter, a government will override. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we can be concerned about and try to ameliorate conditions in South America, the Indian sub-continent, Africa and other places, both by way of sending relief aid and by supporting organisations striving for internal social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the countries concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Espcecially  remembered in their prayers is the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is enacting it in a situation in which the Parliament on each occasion would have an opportunity to explore fully, discuss and analyse it, satisfying itself as to the legitimacy and <span class="highlight">justice</span> of that solution in the particular case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can a government with any concern for equity and <span class="highlight">justice</span> implement a policy that has that son of consequence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he recalls that in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moffitt, the royal commissioner who inquired into allegations of organised crime in New South Wales clubs in 1974, the royal commissioner warned: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that it is pure, basic <span class="highlight">justice</span> that people who have waited for three years for an increase should at least be compensated for the full cost of living increase since 1976. lt is quite wrong that it has been delayed for so long, but we believe that if there is to be an increase it should compensate for that cost of living rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators who oppose not giving <span class="highlight">justice</span> to injured men can only oppose a regulation that gives some increase or accept a regulation that gives some increase, although not a just increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, no honorable senator who believed injustice would give notice of a motion to disallow a regulation that gave some increase, even though he believed that a higher increase was justified <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators can see the privation of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to sections of the community by this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we are being mean and unkind if we treat people in that way and if people such as  Senator Cavanagh, Senator Harradine, Senator Mason  and I do not defend the rights of the people who receive those payments to receive <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that an increase other than a full increase would not really give injured individuals the <span class="highlight">justice</span> they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For three years, the representatives of the Commonwealth employees organisations, the Opposition and many other people in the community have been urging the Government to take action to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to its injured and sick employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is certainly <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not compensate the people concerned for past injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such indexation would bring some measure of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition moves an amendment to the second reading stage of this legislation to try to impress upon the Government the need to bring in some changes, to bring some <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the poeple whom it should be concerned about, its own employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not necessarily in favour, as the Minister would like to imply when she speaks, of the scheme produced by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodhouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uncertainty of the present scheme deprives the injured of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, the cost adds to the burden of both the employer and the employee in the community and the litigation involved adds to the burden so much that in the fields of workers compensation and road accident compensation, private firms are more and more getting out and State governments are having to take over because of the present unsatisfactory situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the only sensible thing to do is what is set out in its amendment: Withdraw this legislation, look at it again through the eyes of the people who are affected and with a sense of <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the people who have been affected, and quickly- it would not take long- bring it back again, providing proper payments for those involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is that understandable as a reason but it is also a matter of gross injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is contrary to all concepts of <span class="highlight">justice</span> that the defendants should not be given the opportunity to meet the charges made against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the Act,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of the matter in economic terms was stressed by  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy, when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the accretion of the 200 nautical mile economic zone around Australia’s coast, we take on board- if that is the appropriate nautical expression- an enormous area of resources as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy and others pointed out in the course of the High Court judgment on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there is such a thing as a secret vote because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope let it slip that there was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Senate to the third and much smaller report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in which at paragraph 86 he recommends: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot feel very happy at the fact that the provisions which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope put forward have not met with any arrangement by the Government to subject these organisations to accountability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody here could give ordinary natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be grossly unfair and a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nigel Bowen,  Sir Cecil  Looker and others presided over that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strange as it may seem, the work of that committee virtually paralleled an inquiry being conducted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the health schemes about which we are talking,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Nimmo ‘s inquiry, quite apart from the high-powered Committee of which  Senator McClelland  was a member, advocated reforms within the ambit of private insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have received only a letter of acknowledgement from  Senator Harradine,  which does not satisfy the hurt feelings of our members, neither does <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight all I want to do is to see that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is much more important is that the whole of the attitude of the union to the dispute was endorsed in a subsequent judgment by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Mary Gaudron in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Union did not oppose the application and the matter came before <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron on 1 3th August and was completed on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meeting, by a substantial majority (only 20 against), carried the following resolution- “That this meeting endorses its previous decision which was carried unanimously to oppose federal award coverage for the purposes of maintaining State award coverage unci the retention of present agreements, and we await the decision of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Gaudron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the substance of what is being said, it is completely outside all the normal procedures of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and of this Parliament that one should seek to form prejudgments on part of a report and in the knowledge that it is in the hands of a government to take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to be a question of standards, what about the standards of a State Labor government which yesterday quite obviously sought to “give every kind of preference to the Labor Party by giving prior knowledge and advantage of a situation and which did not seek, in terms of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>, to put the whole of the report together in one tabled statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are these the standards of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime I ask that those who have even a shred of sense of values in terms of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> wait till the report is complete, till the State Government has made its recommendations and, if those recommendations involve prosecutions, to leave it to the courts to decide the truth in terms of judgmental values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To make those prior judgments is to be in contempt of this Parliament and in contempt of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the reported statement of the Prime Minister that unemployed people are the duller and less motivated people in each age group in the community and that he doubted that the Catholic bishops supported the statement of the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace, in the booklet  Beyond Unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Organised crime is one area about which the Commonwealth is particularly concerned, and in conjunction with four States we set up the Commonwealth Royal Commission into Drugs under the chairmanship of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 21 February 1979  Senator Evans  asked me a question without notice concerning the tabling of material I had recently received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples concerning human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples travelled overseas in July 1 977 at the request of the Government to examine and report on practices, procedures and laws that other countries use for the protection of human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention that I did receive other material from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples during the course of his examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst Australia is under pressure to bear heavy responsibility for victims of various South East Asia form of persecution, you have frequently assured me that other nationalities with a reasonable case would receive <span class="highlight">justice</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to give evenhanded <span class="highlight">justice</span>, I feel that these two cases should receive maximum sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What are the estimated costs of: (a) loose furniture; and (b) soft furnishings, for the offices of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and each other High Court Judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the estimated costs of fixtures and fittings in the offices of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and each other High Court Judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will quote what Lord Denning, that very esteemed Lord <span class="highlight">Justice</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they have not, the plaintiffs should be allowed to leave- even if it means they are fleeing from the reach of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Justices of the High Court of Australia <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Supreme Court of a State proceeding overseas on official business <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a case of whether the Aboriginals should get the <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which they are entitled or whether the mine should get the money making areas to which it thinks it is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister that the Labor Government played an active role in the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and opposed atmospheric tests that the French were carrying out at Mururoa Atoll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator may be referring to the matter involving  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To facilitate proper discussion and knowledgeable debate on the industrial law which we will proceed to debate tomorrow, could the Minister inform us of the judiciary’s opinion of the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act by releasing details of the telexes from the 25 commissioners and the letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples so that we will know the opinion of those who control the Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  concerning a letter written to  Mr Street  by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples on the Government’s proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Street did send round to me on Thursday, or towards the end of last week, a letter to him from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had some discussion with  Mr Street  in relation to the matter on Friday, in the course of which he asked whether I would give consideration to the comments that were being made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples in relation to the amendments which are before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to reveal what discussions have actually taken place between  Mr Street  and me concerning it, but I want to emphasise that what he asked me to do was to look at the questions raised to see whether any comments made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples would raise any matter in relation to the amendments that are proposed to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the industry is satisfied with the practicability with the and the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of any contingency planning to deal with an outbreak of a virulent exotic disease, it is quite clear that cooperation will not be forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is very welcome, and it goes quite a long way towards granting powers to quarantine officers to enable them to enter premises either with the consent of the owner or with a warrant granted by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace in order to carry out his functions of inspection where he reasonably suspects that some infected article is present in those premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it is sufficient for the officer to have such tremendous power under a warrant issued only by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think justices of the peace are permitted to issue many warrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I protest at the giving of this power just on the signature of a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh brought forward a matter relating to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause  8  the Bill authorises a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace to issue a warrant to enter and search premises where he is satisfied by information on oath or affirmation that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there are infected goods at the premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision is similar to section  10  of the Crimes Act which authorises a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace to issue such warrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that a breach of the rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> occurred in connexion with the making of a decision; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been emphasised on many occasions that every person who visits a foreign country is subject to the laws of that country and it is not proper for one Government to seek to intervene in another country’s process of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the serious implications of such an action, highlighted recently by the New South Wales Bar Association, which said that it was of the opinion that proper administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in that State required the cessation of this practice, will the Attorney-General make an objective statement to the Senate in relation to the principles involved so that the Senate can debate this serious matter in order to see whether sensible and helpful guidelines can be established for the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the AttorneyGeneral to my question yesterday concerning the letter which was written to the Minister for Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and which was referred for attention to the Attorney-General by  Mr Street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask my supplementary question: Why did the AttorneyGeneral not reject out of hand  Mr Street’s  overtures to him on this matter and recognise them for what they were- a blatant attempt to intimidate  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and other members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I did not reject out of hand the request from  Mr Street  is that I reject completely the suggestion that what  Mr Street  did was any attempt, blatant or otherwise, to intimidate  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in answer to a question yesterday,  Mr Street  asked me to look at  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter to see whether there were any legal or constitutional implications arising out of it in regard to the proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which will be debated in the Senate later today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So at least those of us who have been working closely with the sugar industry to achieve <span class="highlight">justice</span> for it on that basis have taken into account all of the reductions that have been made in the fertiliser bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just been given to understand from  Senator Bishop  that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore is seeking consultation with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It almost certainly was known to the Government when  Senator Bishop  moved his original motion that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore had conveyed that message to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that the statement from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now know, because the information has been revealed, that the Minister had a copy of the submission from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a question asked of me at Question Time today by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  in which he asked whether any member of my staff made available copies of a statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples dated 28 September 1979 concerning the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that were then before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is his purpose in leaking the information on  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ point of view? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The release of the private letter was clearly designed as part of a move to discredit  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples because of his strong professional criticism of the Government’s latest industrial relations legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The morning after he circulated the letter, both  Mr Street  and the Prime Minister passed derogatory remarks about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples ‘ background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said on PM last night and reiterated again in the Parliament today that he had received verification from someone connected with the program that they held  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments which came before the Senate today, have been condemned by a Commission  Deputy President, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  James Staples, and criticised in telexes sent to the Government by all of the 25 Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not heard yet the answer from the Attorney-General,  Senator Durack,  as to the serious criticisms that were made by  Sir Richard  Kirby and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples about whether the proposed amendments were constitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 agree with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples who said that the proposed amendments are not reforms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the main thrust of the Opposition’s objection to this legislation is based, firstly, on some objections taken by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples to the legislation and, secondly, on some alleged objections taken by other members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Staples apparently has indicated that he does not like the requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples states in his letter that the requirement is that a commissioner shall submit the case to the  deputy president. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, quite frankly, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples has got the bull by the horns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only criticism made of it is that which has come from  Sir Richard  Kirby,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and apparently some others who are adopting their policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Richard Kirby and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples are  opposed to  the legislation because they believe it undermines the integrity and independence of the commission by introducing some procedures and prohibiting others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we have the well publicised objections of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples which I may detail a little later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say now is that in the editorial of the  Australian Financial Review  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples ‘s remarks are said to be devastating criticisms and contain some excellent points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has there a recognition of the force and the truth of the criticisms which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples had made of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to turn to the -comments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>   Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples commented in his letter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Staples ‘s inference of back corridor pressure is a reasonable fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That perhaps involves something unconstitutional but certainly something which denies natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties because somebody who will be involved in saying whether a decision should be certified has not listened to the arguments put forward by the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a grave denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the parties involved in an industrial dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley, in the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union case very recently said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is simple propaganda that no reasonable senator or citizen could support in the face of condemnation by  Sir Richard  Kirby, the elder statesman of the conciliation and arbitration movement in Australia, in the face of published objections, supported by leading editorialists, of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples; or in the face of the unanimous condemnation by the 25 commissioners of the arbitration system or in the face of the plea tonight by  Sir John  Moore for full consultation with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to tip the industrial scales of <span class="highlight">justice</span> the Government’s way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government by this legislation is putting its weight on one side of the scales of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, as we know,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, a  deputy president  of the Commission, has criticised the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has floated the possibility of the dismissal of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples from the Bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels, going to a seminar and attacking legislation that was being introduced by the Labor Government in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there was no criticism by the present members of the Liberal Party and National Country Party when they were in Opposition of the remarks by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels against Labor legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason was that they thought that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels was attacking not the legislation but the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That situation is in reverse as far as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government members are not big enough to realise that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples is making constructive criticism of the legislation before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples is criticising them for their lack of political nous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then when the criticism of the legislation by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples became public we heard that there had been unanimous complaints by the 25 arbitration commissioners, which complaints were made as long ago as 20 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore and the  deputy  presidents of the Commission so that their case could be put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to only one other matter, that is, the release by  Mr Street,  the Minister for Industrial Relations, of the letter written to him by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just to set the record straight, at the time we went to air on Thursday evening and broke the story of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples ‘ letter,  PM  did not have a copy of that letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels of New South Wales criticised part of the policies of the Labor Government when it was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that was so, I believe that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Samuels had no right to criticise the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outburst from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples is quite a different matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples goes on to say that there were no peak council consultations; that again is untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-No system of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, whether it is industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> or any other kind, can operate without the confidence of those who have to administer it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious, further, that the Bill certainly does not have the approval of at least one  Deputy President, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and, moreover, of a number of other  deputy  presidents who met with  Sir John  Moore this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were serious about improving what are genuinely and sincerely perceived to be deficiencies in the present conciliation and arbitration system, if it genuinely wanted to improve the administration of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span> within that system, then one would have thought that its first port of call would have been consultation with the justices and the commissioners who make up the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should have done that not just as a matter of good faith but as a matter of plain common sense since those justices and commissioners are the ones who have to administer this system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, how can we take seriously the Government’s protestations about its sincerity in bringing forward this Bill when we note the way it has responded to the criticism it has received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we take seriously its protestations when we note the way in which it has responded to the reasoned criticisms and arguments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples which have been acknowledged as such by journals as respectable as the  Australian Financial Review! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than responding in a reasoned way to those criticisms, the Government through the Ministers most immediately concerned- they include the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  who is sitting across the chamber here tonight- has responded by the worst kind of personal vilification and denigration of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has responded in a way that has dragged  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ reputation through the dust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has responded by leaking to the Press a proposal that the removal of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples from office was being contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This kind of reaction was totally inappropriate to the kind of reasoned document that was received from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is best proven to this chamber by the incorporation in  Hansard  of this famous document, the letter of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the amendment curtails a provision in the Act which is intended to serve the interest that <span class="highlight">justice</span> shall appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the process of trying to score some cheap political points at the expense of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, the Government has got itself into very considerable hot water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote from the  Hansard  greens what  Mr Street  said in the Parliament today when asked by the honourable member for Parramatta,  Mr John  Brown, whether the Minister stood by his earlier statement that he through his office had checked with  PM to  find out whether it had a copy of the letter from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of this and  Mr Street  ‘s insistence about the checking and his understanding that  PM  did possess a copy of the letter in question is that this is the rationale and the basis upon which  Mr Street  then proceeded to issue to the Press, to the world at large, this confidential communication from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just to set the record straight, at the time we went to air on Thursday evening and broke the story of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples letter,  PM  did not have a copy of that letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was introduced in circumstances which make it impossible to believe that it was a sincere attempt to rectify wrongs which had clearly emerged in the administration of industrial <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the court  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Smith found that the Labor candidate had been improperly denied votes by the tactics of the Liberal candidate,  Mr Alan  Ridge, who was then the Minister for Community Welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are provisions in the Bill which raise other objections, one of which is that to get on to the electoral roll a person has to have an application form signed by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, by an officer of the Electoral Department or by a police officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace is resident there, but certainly there is no person who can be considered to be an officer of the Electoral Department resident there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the statement in today’s  Canberra Times  attributed to  Senator Knight  is misleading and a distortion of the truth, is defamatory and imputes a highly improper motive to me in my efforts to secure <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the whole of the Australian egg industry, I seek from  Senator Knight  an unqualified withdrawal of his misleading statements in the  Canberra Times  today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a travesty of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the argument was best stated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples in- as inevitably is the case with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples- a fairly colourful passage in his now famous letter but one which nonetheless strikes very exactly at the point in issue when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The language of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples has been criticised as being extravagant in a number of respects, but he was not extravagant when he described some provisions- in particular this deregistration provision- as appropriate to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a letter to the  Australian Financial Review,  Mr Mills  stated: (t was encouraging to see in your editorial of 16 October the broad support you offered for the arguments of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples against the Fraser Government’s Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that is not  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sharp’s view of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to quote remarks of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick which I believe to be relevant to the question that the honourable senator has just raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Barwick said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples was one of the offenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, not all of his associates agree with the depth of the criticism that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples has levelled at this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suppose that such criticisms are not surprising when one considers  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ very radical background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague,  Senator Walters,  mentioned last night,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples is a former member of the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With your permission I think it is appropriate for this chamber to consider some of the remarks that have been made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and point out where at least one senator believes he is wide of the mark on matters of his interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out an area of difference or discrepancy between  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ interpretation of these amendments and mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Staples was relating to governments’ requiring justices to fulfil the will of the state or the will of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke had a very respectable right wing background but he debunked all that the Government said about these gigantic plots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he take away information from  Mr Street  to assuage the objections of the 25 commissioners,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and virtually the whole of the trade union movement including the Australian Council of Trade Unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old axiom, well known amongst industrial circles, of <span class="highlight">justice</span> delayed is <span class="highlight">justice</span> denied ‘ is one which we ought to keep in mind when we are considering this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has already said that he is not interested in the views of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples or the views of the conciliation commissioners and he is obviously not interested in the views of  Sir John  Moore because, in fact, the Bill is going to be dealt with by the Senate in the normal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there has never been any legislation to deal with doctors, and we had such a situation only this year when doctors went before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke to establish a fee for service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the instances of judges who have said that they disagree with what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples has said, or what  Sir John  Moore has said? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is something pertinent in what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples said when he stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his letter he fairly substantially endorses the view of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples about deregistration, namely, that in the hands of the GovernorGeneral a trade union of 150,000 or 200,000 members can be deregistered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in September 1976  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ordered a secret ballot of members of the Plumbers and Gasfitters’ Employees’ Union employed as sprinkler pipe fitters to determine whether those members of the union were prepared to work normally in accordance with their award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For instance, in September 1976  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Ludeke ordered a secret ballot of members of the Plumbers and Gasfitters’ Employees’ Union employed as sprinkler pipe fitters to determine whether those members of the union were prepared to work normally in accordance with their award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, in September 1977  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Alley ordered that a secret ballot of builders’ labourers employed on the State Bank construction site in Melbourne be held to determine whether the men were prepared to accept the terms of settlement of the dispute proposed by Commissioner Brown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority decision of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Rich,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Starke and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Dixon states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of that decision of the High Court,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore would obviously know that the clause would have no effect and that the consultations could be no more than just consultations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why this learned <span class="highlight">justice</span>, with that knowledge, would discuss this matter with the Minister and why the Minister should state that he gave him that assurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems ridiculous to me that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore, with his legal knowledge, should seek an assurance about something which is so plain in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement which the Minister made as a result of the disclosure of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples’ letter makes one very suspicious about the accuracy of the Minister’s statement and whether we should accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we accept it we will be saying that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore is incompetent- I do not believe he really is- in wanting an assurance about something which his legal knowledge must have told him would not happen and about which he could have assured his commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any attempt to give a uniform award in the Commission would be wrong and would be a denial of <span class="highlight">justice</span> to which one of the parties is entitled when there is a difference between two applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not refer particularly to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the criticisms of  Sir Richard  Kirby were not enough we also have the statements from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, a man whose remarks have been quoted by honourable senators who have spoken before me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opinions of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples have been soundly and roundly supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples used to be a member of the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do we ever say anything about the decision on income tax law by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples was a communist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only did  Sir Richard  Kirby have things to say; he was supported by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As if outbursts from  Sir Richard  Kirby and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples are not enough, we have had the public denouncement by the 25 commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discussion has involved a former  President  of the Court, a <span class="highlight">justice</span> and 25 commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read it three or four times a year to keep me abreast of what <span class="highlight">justice</span> is required for freedom of association not only in trade unions but also in employer organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now, with this unprecedented situation in the country where a former  President  of the Court, a <span class="highlight">justice</span>, 25 commissioners and, the final climax,  President Sir John  Moore have expressed opposition to the Bill, I think the time is opportune to refer to the document which is entitled ‘The Protection of Trade Union Rights: Twenty Years Work by the Committee on Freedom of Association.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all these outbursts by such eminent men as those whose opinions I mentioned earlier and who are charged with the dispensing of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the industrial arena, we have received no responses from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, very forceful opinions have been expressed by  Sir Richard  Kirby,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples and 25 commissioners, the climax being the meeting between the Minister and  Sir John  Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the recent discussion concerning  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples, as this stage I do not want to enter into any of the matters which he raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As Senator Messner was speaking the former  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, said on  Nationwide  program that the consultation provisions of this Bill that we are debating, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1979, were wrong in principle, making it possible to influence the Commissioners’ decisions, and that other amendments also were unacceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament is indebted to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples for the honest and forthright appraisal of this despicable and underhand attack by the Government on the industrial relations fabric of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples but also his fellow justices and commissioners- all 25 commissioners- and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Australian Government Employees Organisations are appalled at the arrogance and the arbitrariness of this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No leaks occurred until  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples made his statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no thought for the health and welfare of the workers at large who have to go on strike to get <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that that is the same  Mr Street  as the one who had discussions last night with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Moore in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard an honourable senator from Tasmania trying to denigrate <span class="highlight">Justice</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staples here today by saying that at one time <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Staples was a member of the communist party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had been in the chamber at the time, I would have quickly reminded him that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia was Attorney-General in a Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I would sooner have a person who had been a member of that political party, as  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples was accused of being, because he would mete out more <span class="highlight">justice</span> than would the person who was an Attorney-General in a Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen an Attorney-General in a Liberal government here in this chamber tonight deny this chamber <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seventh point I raised related to the matter of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In normal circumstances natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires that he who decides the matter must hear it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this circumstance this particular proposition is against natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I point out to the Attorney-General that this proposal is the reverse of what is contained in section 30 of the Act which maintains the principle of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> insofar as he who decides must also hear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fundamental principle of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> has also been considered and we believe that it is a quite accepted principle in administrative law that to seek advice on policy matters does not infringe the independence of the tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor does the process of the consultation as outlined detract from the independence of the commissioner and thereby infringe natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little over a year ago I was involved in discussions on these matters with the Department of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in Washington. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The island was divided into a number of districts, with supervisors and with people who administered such <span class="highlight">justice</span> as could be administered under quite indescribable circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace or is it someone the Minister decides by regulation is a prescribed authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely our <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands more than that if someone is done an injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Menzies, in delivering judgment and after describing the publication in those words, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps worth remembering that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his second report referred to the need to examine at intervals the working of the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would agree also with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward when he stressed, however, the importance of the broad bases of the arrangements remaining undisturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Attorney-General seen a report of remarks attributed to the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who apparently has strongly criticised the lack of availability to the public of texts of government regulations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the unavailability of government regulations and the remarks of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> concern the Attorney-General in any way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen a newspaper report of remarks made by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, when delivering a judgment in the High Court, I think yesterday or the day before, concerning the question whether copies of regulations were available at a place notified, at the time such regulations were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> said was of great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that I agree with the remarks which the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has made and that we are doing our best and will continue to do our best to meet the ideal requirements which he mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallop passed sentence in Alice Springs on 19 October he strongly recommended that none of the children be imprisoned in an adults gaol and that all of those convicted are now in the Alice Springs prison? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do I detect an acute feeling of remorse in his make-up today in view of the role he had to play at 3 a.m. last Friday in the debate on the punitive industrial legislation and in view of the fact that we have had no report whatsoever on the protracted talks with  Mr Hills  about <span class="highlight">justice</span> for the refinery workers, who suffer an overlapping of Federal and State awards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They flow generally from agreements with the Government of New South Wales which have followed from the time when  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher was the Coal Industry Tribunal, and later was appointed to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment increases and the unemployed suffer, but the Government sticks to its resolve that market forces will somehow solve this problem, and anyone who has the temerity to suggest a different approach- such as the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace or the Anglican Synod in Tasmania- is likely to be labelled as marxist by people such as  Mr Carlton,  the honourable member for Mackellar, who apparently believes that anyone who advocates redistribution of wealth in this community from the more well off to the poorer is automatically a marxist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, no, the name calling starts and anyone who issues a pamphlet, as the Catholic Commission for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and Peace did, is labelled marxist in the pejorative sense for suggesting some change or some new approach to the very real problems which face us in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do this, if we keep adding to the difficulties of the unemployed and the numbers of unemployed and disadvantaged in the community, we will imbue in people a chronic sense of injustice, that things are not fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and the Poor  Reginald Heber Smith said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time many comments were made by many interesting people about what they saw as the <span class="highlight">justice</span> or injustice of such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A miscarriage of <span class="highlight">justice</span> occurs too often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way does the editorial do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the Government’s position or to the work of the committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the AttorneyGeneral, follows his reply to me yesterday concerning criticism by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, of the lack of availability to the public of some regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish merely to point out that the reintroduction of this measure follows its abolition in the previous Budget; that it is merely restoring <span class="highlight">justice</span> to those who need <span class="highlight">justice</span>; and that it does not go far enough, as we said in our amendment, in that it omits to index twice-yearly the benefit received by people who are unemployed and without dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the community and a social services Act which is meant to give assistance to people who are in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was assured that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan would consider this matter as a new application and on the basis of whether the Director-General was incorrect in rejecting the original application; it would not be based on whether he was satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be some <span class="highlight">justice</span> if the matter goes to an Appeals Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the matters that need the earliest attention in order to stop the injustice that occurs now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to learn of his discussions with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why were 17 or 18 Commonwealth Police officers seconded to assist the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed that a man of the experience of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams would fall for the three card trick of considering statistics in determining the worth of a police officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He told us that there has been a conspiracy to finger the Federal Narcotics Bureau- a conspiracy which I assume involves  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, who brought down the interim report of his Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs; a conspiracy which, I assume involves members of the Government and the Cabinet, in view of  Senator Chipp  ‘s remarks on the way in which the inquiry was allegedly carried out; a conspiracy which I assume involves members of the Commonwealth Police and the new Federal Police, as well as the criminals whom he is so concerned about and speaks about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was evaluated by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim report of which I have a copy, which certainly is not as large as  Senator Chipp  ‘s report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has given compelling reasons as to why the Narcotics Bureau could not continue in the manner in which it was constructed under existing legislation; how the Bureau could not continue in the way in which it was going; how it spent so much of its time defending itself and its image; how over 90 per cent of its heroin seizures in 1 977 and 1978 were of less than 100 grams, when the seizure of quantities of less than 5 grams represented over 60 per cent of its seizures in 1 978 and 70 per cent of its seizures in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Williams has recommended coordination and the Government will attempt to co-ordinate the activities against drug traffickers- to co-ordinate the whole operation in this country- because we are dealing with ruthless and sophisticated men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the amount of money iswhether it is the $700m that  Senator Chipp  talked about or whether it is the $80m odd that was referred to in the report by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward presented in the New South Wales Parliament today- it has to be recognised that it is an area of tremendous growth and an area which presents tremendous problems for the law enforcement agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, at this late stage we are not in a position to talk to any great extent about the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward which were presented in the New South Wales parliament today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I refer the AttorneyGeneral to the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking in New South Wales in which the Commissioner noted that he had been assured of co-operation in the usual way from the then Attorney-General,  Mr Ellicott. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what efforts did the Attorney-General make to ensure that full, or at least effective, co-operation was given by Federal authorities to assist  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his inquiry into this matter of national concern? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Letters were exchanged between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales and there were discussions between officers attached to the two royal commissionsthe Australian royal commission presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams and the New South Wales royal commission presided over by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward- which were designed to endeavour to achieve co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Leader of the Government seen the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, presented to the New South Wales Parliament, in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward mentions the lack of representation by Australia in the Golden Triangle area of South East Asia and complains that he was not able to evaluate Australia’s efforts in Thailand because the Federal Narcotics Bureau agent there was instructed not to give information to the Royal Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the provisions in question are from the Administrative Review Council the Opposition’s position is that, subject perhaps to better explanation in some areas, the Opposition will accept them because we are satisfied with the credibility and the stature of that advisory body which is headed by the three ex officio members-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan,  President  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; Professor Richardson, the Ombudsman; and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Michael Kirby,  Chairman  of the Australian Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no use just looking at what they say; but if they say that with their system there will be greater freedoms, more democracy and greater <span class="highlight">justice</span> than under the systems existing elsewhere in the world, surely all of us have a necessity to examine how they do conduct their own societies so see whether their words and the claims they make about superiority of their system and the desirability of that system being adopted by other countries is borne out by what one sees practiced within their own society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a speech entitled ‘Human Rights: The Challenge for Law Reform’ which was recently delivered by  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby as the Turner memorial lecture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lord <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Scarman said recently that the universal common law is in retreat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constraints in judicial law making have been one cause, although not the only one, which have contributed to the need to establish new and more effective means, more in tune with our times, to deal with many aspects of <span class="highlight">justice</span> being done and seeming to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It sets out our views on <span class="highlight">justice</span> and law reform and then says that one of the matters that should be done to give effect to the principles is: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in presenting his 1979 Bentham Oration, was moved to make this point: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Which brings me back to natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the need to embody it in law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally,  Sir Norman  Anderson again presenting a Hamlyn Lecture entitled ‘Liberty, Law and <span class="highlight">Justice</span>’ was at great pains to spend part of his discussion on illustrating why he believed the state of the common law in Great Britain was such as to require, in that country, the enactment of a Bill of rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague  Senator Missen  has already indicated, the Turner Memorial Lecture delivered by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby- I think it was printed in the University of Tasmania Law Review in 1 976- again canvassed this issue in some considerable detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Holt, a great chief <span class="highlight">justice</span>, born in 1642, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> at the age of 23 years, Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for 41 years- not some woolly-minded academic- a man who was harsh on treason and sedition but who held out against the prosecution of witches, who adopted a liberal construction on statutes compelling church attendance, a man who was concerned with human rights and who used his unparallelled position as Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> for 41 years to secure them, said of that elementary maxim: ‘Whenever the common law gives a right it also gives a remedy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, I certainly do not intend that I or any judicial inquiry should deal with the facts of evidence or interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> as it affects the prosecution or defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that if we are prevented from moving such a motion or, by implication, debating such a matter in this place until all these court cases are finished, <span class="highlight">justice</span> not only will not be done to the people in the case but also will not be done to the community of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question which relates not to the immediate matters before the court such as those which would adversely prejudice or effect a particular litigant but to the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to questions about the conduct of the police and the prosecution which, unless they are satisfactorily answered, would confirm the serious doubts which are already held in the community at large about the quality of the administration of criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> by our federal agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to you,  Mr President,  that it is impossible to think of a matter more squarely within the public interest than these fundamental questions which are related to the administration of criminal investigation and criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> and which are involved in the motion moved by  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  as you would know, the question is not whether the proposed judicial inquiry might interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span> in the events before the courts in Sydney but whether a debate in this chamber would so interfere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Holt, who at the age of 23 years ascended to the bench and who was on the bench for 42 years, very strongly opposed the persecution of witches and very strongly tried to modify the effects of those laws which required compulsory attendance in certain churches and denied rights to members of other, even Christian, communions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think of our legal protections for the human rights of Australians as a happy blend between British <span class="highlight">justice</span> and the Australian ‘fair go ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest case on the subject was the 1975 High Court decision on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, which does not help us much because it was not concerned with the internal scope of the external affairs power, although <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Murphy did state a wide view of the power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the more recent Airlines case of 1965, there is little discussion of the external affairs power, although <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Menzies did say that under section 51 (29) the Commonwealth has power to make laws that carry out international obligations under a convention with other nations concerning external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, as has been pointed out by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Kirby, despite the great differences of history, culture and language, European countries have been able to produce a European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe has produced more than 100 conventions on such diverse subjects as extradition, the legal status of migrant workers, transplantation laws and suppression of terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I changed my mind on this matter when I heard a magnificent lecture- I believe that  Senator Evans  was on the platform with me at the time- by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the criteria which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby mentioned was that we do not need a Bill of rights if the electorate is informed and active. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second criterion, as I remember what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby said, was that a Bill of rights was needed if politicians voted on issues and not according to party direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders about the capacity of this chamber and of this Parliament to comply with  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby ‘s criterion that politicians should vote on issues as they see them and not vote on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third criterion that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby mentioned was that every individual, no matter how underprivileged or how lacking in affluence, should have the right to sue, the right to legal action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> had its way and the weekly national settled out of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After looking at  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby ‘s criteria, I find that Australia meets none of them at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would have the effect of smashing the criminal rackets which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward has revealed exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, when there is a feeling of unfairness among hundreds and thousands of Australians whereby they see on the one hand, society authorising, legalising and making big money by way of excise and normal company and income taxation out of the circulation of authorised drugs, such as tobacco, alcohol and analgesics, and, on the other, repressive legislation which characterises the attack on marihuana users and which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward recommended ought to be strengthened in its penalties, it is no wonder that there is no widespread community support for what ought to be the situation, namely, an evenhanded attack on drug abuse, of whatever character, which is occurring throughout the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition knew there would be investigations and we on this side avoided comment because we did not want to interfere with the course of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The High Court shall consist of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and so many other Justices, not less than 2, as the Parliament prescribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Judiciary Act  1903  which provided for a High Court consisting of a Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> and two other Justices included a provision:   on and after a date to be fixed by Proclamation the principal seat of the High Court shall be at the seat of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 23 provides that, in the event of there being an equal division of the High Court upon the hearing of an appeal from a judge of the High Court or from a supreme court of a State, the decision appealed from is to be affirmed and that in any other case the opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or the senior <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the High Court present shall prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, in appeals from all courts created by this Parliament, if there is an equal division of the High Court the opinion of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> determines the outcome of the appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I do not see this proposed amendment as providing an ideal solution I see it as securing fundamental <span class="highlight">justice</span>, and not just for this man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has rejected this recommendation- the Attorney’s statement says as much- on the grounds primarily that this would amount to undue interference by the Executive in the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of an Institute of Judicial Administration was, as the report states, first mooted in 1 974 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, in whose judgment the Government hitherto has demonstrated considerable confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons it was mooted by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox are set out at length in the report, in which there is also reference to the precedents for such institutes of judicial administration in various overseas jurisdictions, notably the United States of America and Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has also been very strong support for the concept of such an institute from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Evans has referred to the view of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, that he does not favour support of the present private Institute of Judicial Administration, but he did go on to say, as quoted in the report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not saying that there is not some <span class="highlight">justice</span> in some circumstances in relation to mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has suggested that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  would listen to outside organisations and that he is not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to his job, which I took as a criticism of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government has recognised,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey pointed out in connection with the Borroloola land claim that non-Aboriginal groups which had financial hardship were unable to retain adequate legal counsel to present their case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the transcript of proceedings concerning Borroloola taken before  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, at Darwin on Tuesday 22 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting to look at the summing up and the remarks that have been made by the various legal people who appeared before  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the whole purpose of this amending legislation is to further restrict Aborigines in their lawful search for <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not see any <span class="highlight">justice</span> in taking from him powers which I think he can exert responsibly and putting then in the hands of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know, that claim is not yet settled but we hope it will be settled by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey by early next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following on the report of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox on the Ranger  Uranium  Environmental Inquiry the Government embodied in legislation the proviso that if a mining interest had been applied for before June 1976 on land which subsequently became Aboriginal land then Aborigines could not prevent uranium mining but could merely negotiate terms and conditions of that mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that the Aboriginal land claim over the Pancontinental area has not yet been heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toohey, the present Commissioner, has expressed the view that the Minister has power to accept all or part of a Land Commissioner’s recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said during the Senate’s discussion on the Borroloola land claim, <span class="highlight">justice</span> must not only be done but be seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators who feel that there is something wrong in examining the Act in that way might console themselves by looking at the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward stated in paragraph 757: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On examining those paragraphs one sees, I think, a very sensible observation on the part of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward that here is something new that will need to be examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view was taken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report- he was asked to report only on the Northern Territory- that an examination of the State position would take much longer but that what was done in the Northern Territory would provide something of a precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other point I want to make- I stress that I stated it in correspondence to the Minister- is that the disallowance provision is important in the operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act because of what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward said in his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has one full-time  president, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan, four full-time  deputy  presidents, two senior full-time members, two senior part-time members and 18 ordinary parttime members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It consists of the following ex-officio members: The  President, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Richardson and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Michael Kirby, as  Chairman  of the Australian Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can pay very considerable tribute to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan and the work that he has already done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, some of them were so identified by the  Chairman  of the Administrative Review Council,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Brennan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In November 1 977  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kaye held that a levy of the annual general service fee was beyond the powers of the University of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was supported in his position by the Pro Chancellor,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn, who could hardly be considered to be amongst any radical elements on that campus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Friday in Brisbane, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia rejected the Australian Wheat Board’s submission that the wheat marketing case was settled and committed Ubergang’s case for hearing in the full High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-78-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some <span class="highlight">justice</span> when the Whitlam Government related the awards for post-graduate students to a researcher’s salary at the university level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main substantive change in this particular Bill is the removal of the power of a casting vote from the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> where there is an equality of judges, an evenly divided court, in appeals from the Federal Court, from Territory Supreme Courts, or from the Family Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto, in those situations where there has been an equal division of judges, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> has had a casting vote, unlike the situation which has obtained in the State Supreme Courts, where appeals coming from those jurisdictions and resulting in an even division of opinion have resulted in the majority decision at the lower level- the State level- prevailing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would also appear, certainly to the Opposition, to be very appropriate to be reducing the personal power of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we had occasion to say a number of times in 1975, the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is, after all, but one judge among seven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  particular prejudices or the prejudices of any chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the day should not be given any unnecessary weight such as was given under the system which has prevailed pending the passage of this Bill today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this represents an interesting dimuninon in the power of the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, and his successors, -to which they will be obliged to accommodate themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Court with the function of assisting judges, I imagine especially the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, in his and their performance of those administrative functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there is a vacancy in an office of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, the Attorney-General shall, before an appointment is made to the vacant office, consult with the Attorneys-General of the States in relation to the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was only with the appointment of  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson very recently that Western Australia had its first appointment to the Bench, and it remains true that neither South Australia nor Tasmania has ever had members on the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was in 1970 that the Senate, at the suggestion of the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,  Senator Murphy,  now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of the High Court of Australia, and with the support of all parties established the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is the practice of the Department to conform to these basic rules of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>: (a) for what length of time is the notice which is provided; (b) what details of the evidence are provided (for example, reports of field officers, the names of informants, and copies of all statements); and (c) is the pensioner or beneficiary permitted to make an oral or written representation to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Department, if the notice, information and opportunity referred to in (1) above are not provided, restructure its procedures in view of the serious invasion of the rights of pensioners and beneficiaries involved in such a denial of natural <span class="highlight">justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those things that I ‘ve said are on the basis that they relate to the adherence to principles of independence of the Courts and indeed the criticism that I most strongly make is that it cuts across the time honoured principle, that not only must <span class="highlight">justice</span> be done, but that it must also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that the former Australian Ambassador to the United States,  Mr Alan  Renouf, has stated in a letter to appear in the shortly forthcoming issue of the  Australian Law Journal  that in his view the Australian Government made an ‘error of magnitude ‘ in choosing to go to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in this matter rather than to arbitration and that the Australian Government is quite likely to be seriously politically embarrassed, over time, as a result of this decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commission’s terms of reference do not contain a deadline but I have been assured by the  Chairman, Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby, that the Commission will endeavour to produce the report without delay within the availability of Commissioners, staff and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kirby expects to be able to produce a report with reasonable speed and that would seem to cover the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I do not manage to cover all the topics, I am very sorry that I have not been able to give <span class="highlight">justice</span> to these subjects in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third item that I wish to raise, and I think time will probably run out on me to do it proper <span class="highlight">justice</span>, is the matter of the allowance to the Governor-General which appears under the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that the allegations have been made, I am grateful to the Queensland Government for having extended the commission of the royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, to clear my name and also to expose the base nature of the honourable members of the Queensland Parliament who made the allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that  Senator Mulvihill  raises as to the question of a security service’s leaking or divulging information to other than authorised sources was something that greatly concerned  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and about which he made very strong representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Court of Australia, constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, found that Terence Keogh at all relevant times was of general bad character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise my voice in protest at the way in which these people are being denied economic and social <span class="highlight">justice</span> apparantly based on comparable standards on a year to year basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not mind if the same sort of <span class="highlight">justice</span> was being meted out to residents of other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is, and I ask the Minister to comment on this, that if governments only woke up they would realise that a small amount of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and equity today would remove the necessity in future years for massive expenditures in dealing with the end results of the disintegration of the family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that if the Queensland Director of Social Services accepts all recommendations from the Appeals Tribunal and in New South Wales over one quarter of the recommendations are rejected, frankly, I would like to see the Queensland Director of Social Services transferred to New South Wales so that the people of New South Wales could get a bit of <span class="highlight">justice</span> along the same lines as that received by people in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to your wonderful &amp; encouraging letter of August 27th, 1979 and especially the portion which “<span class="highlight">Justice</span> has Prevailed”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the client department, or by the client department’s unofficial master, who appears to have been the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design documentation has accordingly required close collaboration between the architects, the builder, the NCDC, which is the construction authority, and the user, represented in the main  by the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, and the Attorney-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point to which I wish to draw particular attention is why the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>- designated or regarded as the chief user- I think that is the term- especially since one would not expect that the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> would be around for much longer than the High Court; one would certainly hope not, anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is scarcely conceivable that a chief <span class="highlight">justice</span> who has been exposed to criticism from such a variety of sources as has the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> should still occupy this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I requested that the matter receive the attention of the Standing Orders Committee so as to clarify whether there was any constraint, special protection or restriction on the comments that may be made about members of the judiciary, including the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I submit that there is nothing in the Standing Orders of the Senate which provides any special privilege or protection for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> or which says that he or any other <span class="highlight">justice</span> should be treated in any way different from any other citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that to call the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> a dirty crook, even if it is an expression of the opinion of the honourable senator making that statement, is unparliamentary and justifies some action being taken against the honourable senator concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tempers are becoming frayed and we are not doing <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the job we have been appointed to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also told that in the private bathroom of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> most of the plumbing was pulled out because he wanted gold plated taps put over his private wash hand basin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incomprehensible to me that the Government should expect co-operation from members of the Opposition when very little <span class="highlight">justice</span> is given to our colleagues- especially my colleague  Senator Walsh,  who has now been removed from the chamber, not for one day but for one week- and when the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  sits mute after reasonable requests have been made for information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government plans to devote $4.3 m of its $ 16m share of Federal national highways construction grants in 1978-79 to work on the Stuart Highway, but it claims, with some <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that more help is needed from Canberra to enable the job to be completed within a reasonable period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier tonight  Senator Walsh  was suspended from the service of the Senate because he passed certain remarks about the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, that old, old man of Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as the report goes on to say, some of this information was available to the Government at the time in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward’s report following the Ranger inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that you will ask me to be careful in saying this,  Mr President,  but the present Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, from his eminent position has achieved by way of judgment what he was unable to achieve by way of argument as counsel before the Privy Council, namely, a situation in which section 260 of the Act is emasculated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs seen various reports, most recently in the  Age  newspaper this morning, that in his confidential report to the Government on the Narcotics Bureau,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams strongly criticised the permanent head of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs,  Mr Tim  Besley, over his evidence to that inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Smith ordered a new election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Justice</span> Smith found that 96 people had been improperly deprived of their right to vote for Ernie Bridge and for that reason declared the election void- the winning margin having been only 93 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improprieties found by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Smith were those of a group of Perth lawyers who were briefed by the Liberal Party in obstructive scrutineering tactics to be used in polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major amendment to the State Electoral Act, the amendment which is the target of this Bill- Clause 8 in the Western Australian amendment- is that which requires applications for enrolment to be witnessed by either a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the peace, a police officer, a clerk of courts or an electoral officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The probability is high that an Aborigine’s only previous contact with justices of the peace, policemen or clerks of court, would have been as a victim of the punitive or disciplinary arm of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede there are Aboriginal justices of the peace at some settlements, but that is far from ubiquitous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, one is a bit diffident if one has to go to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, or some other agency, and then finds a powerful government alongside a particular multinational. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were signed by Leigh van der Hoek, the man who was sacked; Roy Mclvor; Leo Rosendale, <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace; and Ted Bowen, a council member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The statutory declaration is signed by R. Mclvor and witnessed by a <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They reflect the decision forced upon the Government, much to its embarrassment, by the recent report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams containing a recommendation to disband the Federal Narcotics Bureau and to vest the Federal narcotics law enforcement powers in the new Australian Federal Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then, of course, the legislation having gone through, having been forced through by this Government under these circumstances, we had tabled in this Parliament just a few weeks ago the interim report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams’ Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommending the disbanding of that narcotics bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, it subsequently appeared that the confidential report which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams issued at the same time takes those allegations rather further than simple incompetence to the extent that there are very grave reasons to suppose that that organisation was not free from corruption of a high order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has Australia waived the objection it would be entitled to make to the exercise of jurisdiction by the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference of such matters to the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is a proper and reasonable method Of resolving differences between friendly countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought this was what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor was inquiring into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people for <span class="highlight">justice</span> in this land which is rightfully theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Will the Government consider adding to this list the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Australia as recommended by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Meares? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></li>
