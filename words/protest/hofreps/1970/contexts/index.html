<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When members of this Opposition, united, <span class="highlight">protest</span> at such unjust laws, they do if in that very spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that 22nd April was celebrated by millions of Americans as Earth Day and that this massive <span class="highlight">protest</span> was against the poisoning of the atmosphere, pollution of rivers and streams, destruction of wildlife and the total rape of man’s environment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he support such a demonstration by a <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement or a moratorium if one were to be organised in Australia, or does he agree with the delegate at the Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution who said: ‘Subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter a very modest <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this hour of the morning because of the way the measure has been dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition because this is the first time in 5 years that I have heard any <span class="highlight">protest</span> coming from the Opposition about the repression of civil liberties and the right of people to live their lives in decency and freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have inquiries made by my Department to see whether an effective <span class="highlight">protest</span> can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this Parliament against the manner in which the Government is treating the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against his conduct in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is however customary to place any <span class="highlight">protest</span> formally on record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly I want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the fact that we have been treated tonight to one more farcical display. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have any public authorities registered an official <span class="highlight">protest</span> against these plans; if so, which. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-24-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There cannot be any <span class="highlight">protest</span> against what I propose, because secondary industry over the years has been subsidised many times the $500m that I have referred to and at the expense and cost of primary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If each took his allotted time a debate lasting  2i  hours would ensue which means that we would be sitting after 4 a.m. As a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the lack of consideration, the gall and the audacity of the Government in commencing the consideration of these estimates at this time, 1 move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did Australia <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the United. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  so blatantly moved the gag on the second reading stage of the debate on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do  this as  a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the House sitting after midnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what date or dates did he have discussions with the Prime Minister about further possible <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the South African Government against its racial sporting policies as mentioned in the Prime Minister’s statement to the House on 9th September 1971 (Hansard, page 989). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what date or dates did he or the Prime Minister or any representatives of the Australian Government have discussions with any official or officials of the South African Embassy in relation to how that Embassy and the South African Government would react to a possible expression of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the Australian Government against the South African Government’s racial sporting policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise merely to record my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which these complicated amendments have been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not detain the Committee any longer, but I record my <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I make a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> against continuous smearing of our Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what the honourable member is really referring to is that there are a number of organisations, including students in particular, which have limited financial resources and which depend upon the media to give them publicity They therefore indicate to the media some <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally that they intend to hold, and the media are there when something is going to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we, the undersigned, <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising rights for the Victorian Pink Pages Telephone Directories to an American Company, General Telephone and Electronics Corp., U.S.A., trading in Australia as Directories (Aust.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should an announcement be made by the Government of China that it intends to explode one or more nuclear devices, will the Government on behalf of the Australian people immediately lodge with China and the United Nations the strongest possible <span class="highlight">protest</span> against such a decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Government immediately lodge with China and the United Nations a note of <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the strongest terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had no desire, yesterday, to challenge the authority of your high office as  Speaker  of the House but I wished to <span class="highlight">protest</span> the Government’s restriction of today’s debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his <span class="highlight">protest</span> note on the nuclear tests, he said that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China was oral so there would be no written response? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia’s Ambassador to China, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,’  lodged a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note with the Chinese Assistant Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I offer my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this stage in relation to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude my remarks by saying again that I offer my strongest <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the removal of that part of the oath of allegiance and the affirmation of allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I <span class="highlight">protest</span>, as I must- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will he show me, as promised, the letters of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the national health scheme from Gympie about which he made serious allegations and which he has since repeated to me in a letter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he, by dismissing these letters and protests, indicate that he thinks that Australians and Gympie citizens are so stupid that they will sign and send letters of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to their member unless those letters are an expression of their intent and feeling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers concerned were ordered to open their cars to be searched, but in one of the two cases when it was pointed out to the police that an official <span class="highlight">protest</span> could result, the requirement was dropped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A formal <span class="highlight">protest</span> note was handed to the Foreign Ministry by the Australian High Commissioner on 5 October 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a <span class="highlight">protest</span> been made to the Tanzanian authorities over this incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what form did the <span class="highlight">protest</span> take, and when was it made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following upon my initial <span class="highlight">protest</span>, Caucus made him make that reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Housing and Construction aware of retaliatory action taken by the Building Workers Industrial Union in Brisbane against insurance company buildings in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the failure of many insurance companies to meet flood damage claims? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to add my <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the fact that not sufficient time has been given by the Government in this Parliament to debate foreign affairs, which is of vital importance to this country at any stage, but I believe more particularly at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the attitude taken by the Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison)  with respect to this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span>,  Mr Chairman,  against the mean minded attitude - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He will recall that that reference was made in rather special circumstances and that there was some <span class="highlight">protest</span> from honourable members on this side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable member for Calare  (Mr Mackenzie)  that the formation of the Cattlemen’s Union of Australia was a spontaneous gesture of <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which the conservative coalition Government has ignored the needs of cattlemen in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> tonight on behalf of the residents of the Glebe Estate about the increased rents that are being charged by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, has the Government made the strongest possible <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Government of the Soviet Union over this deplorable incident? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I must <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the continual gagging of the debate on this very important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Speaker, I wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the fact that this is the second occasion on which the matter of public importance I intended to raise today will be gagged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to <span class="highlight">protest</span> very strongly about the gagging of this matter of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which the business of the House is being conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Wills, on a belated entry into the proper area designated for the business of this House- as distinct from the side benches- is serious in his <span class="highlight">protest</span>, then leave is not granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Address-in-Reply debate honourable members can <span class="highlight">protest</span> as much as they like about matters that they think are wrong, but Ministers are free completely to ignore them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, even if the more professional critics of the democratic society are prepared to accept this assessment, there remains the problem of those who <span class="highlight">protest</span> at being excessively remote from the seats of power and lacking in any influence upon the decision makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When 200 or 300 people gather together to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, that does not mean that the Australian people are not with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the honourable member for Hunter sees 50 or 100 people gathered together - and this is a failing also of the Australian Labor Party - he suggests that it is the whole Australian community protesting and that the whole Australian community supports him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to all primary producers to close their ranks and to hold <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I welcome <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings and the more marchers we have the better it will be, because we understand their problems, we want their backing and we will fight for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the poor person who protests, refuses to register or has a conscientious objection to the war does his time the hard way in Pentridge, Long Bay or somewhere else because of the policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is scandalous that, in this situation, some people are in prison, others are facing charges and action is being taken against people who have the courage of their convictions and <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this unproclaimed war while people who go to Vietnam and sabotage our efforts are allowed to go completely free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let him wriggle out of this unproclaimed and undeclared war proposition and tell u.s why a man can commit treason and go free when another man cannot <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the war or refuse to register for national service without being placed in gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although at this very moment North Vietnamese troops are invading Laos and killing and driving out its peaceful inhabitants, not a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> has come from the people who demonstrate so vehemently against the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> has come from the Labor Party despite the fact that 68 Federal Labor parliamentarians have agreed to act as sponsors, along with Communists and others, at the proposed moratorium to be held against the assistance we are giving South Vietnam to resist Communist aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No mention is made of offering any solution lo the frustrations being felt on wage issues by white collar organisations and trade unions whose confidence in the arbitration system has been shattered, and 1 cite the recent upsurge of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by .professional engineers at their recent wages decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why today 1 add my voice of <span class="highlight">protest</span>, though not so much about what is in the Bill because we should be grateful for what we get from this Government be it great or small, because we will never get anything great in this human field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again express my pleasure that the letters I have received in <span class="highlight">protest</span> have been partially answered by the concession that has been given but express again my regret that a scheme that has a good foundation, a good basis and a good objective fails because of the restrictions placed upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister recognises the needs of the community, for which his Department is responsible - and he honestly does recognise them - and if he puts them before his Cabinet and his colleagues knock him back and his Prime Minister will not accept his proposals, he ought to resign, and thus show his sincerity, as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the manner in which the needs of the Department which he is in charge of have been rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to the honourable gentleman’s question: It is a fact that an organisation has been established to endeavour to persuade the public of Australia that there is some sort of movement here to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against Vietnam involvement which is separate and distinct and indigenous to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he receive reports from the Minister for Defence before he left us and the Minister for the Interior following their promise to 10,000 farmers, who marched in Melbourne to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the continuing crisis in the countryside, that they would convey to the Prime Minister without delay the farmers’ <span class="highlight">protest</span> and their request for action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister has received the reports and noted the further march by 3,000 protesting farmers in Perth, will he tell the House what specific action he intends to take to end the economic deep freeze in the countryside contrasting with the Treasurer’s overheating? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will it be that every man who raises his voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the monstrous policies and actions of your Government in this Parliament will automatically be thrown out of the Parliament and refused the right to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the time has come to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have made a plea and a <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the honourable member for Wills stood up, we did not have a riot like that in the Japanese Diet where members stood up and threw ink wells, which might be a salutary method of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, there are available to them methods of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which have been accepted by custom and which are part of the traditions of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is good enough for the  Deputy  Prime Minister to suggest that what happened here was a legitimate <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the denial, the abrogation of the job that we as members are sent here to do, then it is good enough to suggest that those 10,000 farmers were making a similar logical <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I accept that the Opposition had the right to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If after the honourable member for Wills was named honourable members opposite felt they had to make a <span class="highlight">protest</span> there was one <span class="highlight">protest</span> they could make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of those members who stood in his place here this morning in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the actions that were taking place here - actions by  Mr Speaker  and by the Government - I say that I would do it again with other honourable members on this side because we are determined that democracy will be returned to this place so that honourable members will have the opportunity to bring business before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It originated in the United States of America, where certain people conceived the idea that a series of nationwide strikes, increasing progressively in length by 1 day a month, should be organised to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another  speaker  - that is, another  speaker  at this meeting chaired by the honourable member for Lalor held at the Richmond Town Hall - described the stoning by demonstrators of the United Slates Consulate-General in Melbourne in July 1968 as ‘an effective form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, organisers of relatively small <span class="highlight">protest</span> marches and demonstrations have been unable, even when they wished to do so, to exclude or control those extremist minorities whose methods of operation are repugnant to all decent citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making his decision he will inevitably disclose his attitude to violent <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I deal in detail with the case presented by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  let me say that I think it is important to state that there would not be any members in this House who would not suggest that at the appropriate time and place appropriate protests in this country against laws can be valuable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also one would never contest the case that there was a special obligation on members of Parliament, whatever their Party, and on any other members of those parties to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in a way which is most likely to conduce to the welfare of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the recent election the Labor Party has come to be within a few seats of obtaining government in this nation and for that very reason a special obligation was placed upon it, its leaders and each of its members to observe the laws and the appropriate ways in which to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should it <span class="highlight">protest</span> against Vietnam and against nowhere else, no other organisation and no other country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do they not take time off to <span class="highlight">protest</span> with regard to Cambodia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when Cambodia is under attack in significant parts of its territory and North Vietnamese troops are involved, as acknowledged by leaders of that country - past as well as present leaders - these honourable members as well as others take the time, not to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against those facts, not to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against facts concerning the massacres of Hue, not to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against facts concerning other Communist massacres and terrorist campaigns, but to <span class="highlight">protest</span> merely against the Vietnam campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so they make their <span class="highlight">protest</span> extremely narrow and curiously selective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can guarantee that only if fair and reasonable outlets are available for <span class="highlight">protest</span> and dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They never seem to express any sympathy or understanding of it at all and constantly take the attitude that everyone who expresses dissent or <span class="highlight">protest</span> is either an idiot or a Communist and should not be taken seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I make one criticism, it is because I think it would have been better to have made these facts known earlier before innocent people who believe that this is a genuine <span class="highlight">protest</span> and who believe there is no underlying importance to it or underlying usage being made of it, signed the moratorium document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, an analysis of what he said shows that he was addressing the rebel group of the Trades Hall Council, the rebel unionists, the same people who were involved in the O’Shea case, the same people who put on that innocent little <span class="highlight">protest</span> outside the Industrial Court, the same people who wanted to tip over the police car, and the same people who wanted to press onto the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnam Moratorium Committee’s Victorian Headquarters has asked groups and individuals to vigorously participate with whatever slogans and forms of <span class="highlight">protest</span> they feel appropriate to end the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘whatever forms of <span class="highlight">protest</span>’ they may wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This desire is shared by all, but the people must ask themselves whether this is a genuine <span class="highlight">protest</span> and whether it is intended to be violent or non-violent, bearing in mind that it will be held in Melbourne on a Friday afternoon, the most busy shopping afternoon, in the busiest block, when school children, young children and women will be present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People have a right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in Australia but they do not have the right to place in jeopardy the lives of other people or to break the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to register my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the Government’s lack of control over this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 enter an emphatic <span class="highlight">protest</span> against these procedures which take up the time set aside for the Grievance debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that attitude is the significance of all that is involved in <span class="highlight">protest</span> and dissent today and that is why I move my amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against men dying in Vietnam - he could not care if troops died there year in and year out - he would do nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When men want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against troops being sent to war - a war in which we should not be engaged - that is anarchy of the worst type and no member of Parliament should join in that <span class="highlight">protest</span>.I have never heard such hypocrisy in my life as that advanced by the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today when we seek the right to be at <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings against the war in Vietnam, which is morally wrong, which is unjust, in which this country should never have been engaged, and in which conscripted boys are dying at this moment, the Government says that this is not as important as the Melbourne Cup and that we ought to be here instead of adding our support to this <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision was announced at 2.25 p.m. We have spent 1 hour and 10 minutes talking about a wide variety of things; but essentially we have been talking about a Vietnam war <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement which will culminate on 8th, 9th and 10th May, of which, I think, 75 parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party are sponsors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the time had not been spent on this <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement, according to the calculations of the Whip that honourable member would have been speaking now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to what the honourable member said today he elevates the shaping of public <span class="highlight">protest</span> to equality with the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He not merely equates the Vietnam <span class="highlight">protest</span> with Parliament, he subjugates Parliament to that <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to achieve the subjugation he moved the amendment we are discussing so that this national Parliament would not sit in order that he could attend the <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason given for this amendment is that the honourable member for Lalor and others want to attend the Vietnam <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings on 8th May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to place this <span class="highlight">protest</span> on record because my colleague the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  expressly desired to have, and I certainly expected to hear, the Government’s explanation of why it would not accept our proposal that the Bill be postponed in order to allow the credit unions to be included unconditionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Dr Everingham  (Labor, Queensland) pointed out in an unanswerable speech - unanswerable to anyone who knows the facts - if it is good manners, fair democratic action for farmers to march through the streets of Melbourne and <span class="highlight">protest</span>, surely it is legitimate for people to abominate the undeclared war in Vietnam: the conscription of our young in one age group only by lottery: to see the lack of any equality of sacrifice by all Australians, surely it is legitimate for them to want a Moratorium or any attempt at peace by peaceful demonstration, without being branded Communist’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is illustrated by the mounting crisis which is spreading throughout rural Australia arid is characterised by organised marches and <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings of farmers and rural workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition supported the farmers in their <span class="highlight">protest</span> march held recently in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Agreement that had been made because it said it was contrary to the long term interests and the wishes of the people of South Vietnam who had a right to independence and freedom and did not want aggression within their own territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: When not protesting about the possible loss nf professional freedom the less well informed members of the profession, and this seems to be a majority, <span class="highlight">protest</span> that the present direct doctorpatient financial relationship is hallowed by centuries, if not millennia of sacred tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are ample opportunities for criticism, for <span class="highlight">protest</span> and for objection to the attitude of any government in Australia, still keeping within the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Australian people to the  President  of the United States of America against the slaughter of 4 students at Kent University, Ohio, by National Guardsmen while the students were exercising their democratic right to dissent from American policy in Cambodia and Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> was raised even though there was a statement in black and white - in all probability innocently written - admitting to an infringement upon the rights of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anyone ever doubted the role played by the <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement in sustaining the morale of the Communists he could hardly do so any more after carefully reading this document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is, by withdrawal of United States troops and the acceptance of a coalition government may be expected to arise out of American political weakness, the nature of which is accurately described and the intensity of which is in direct proportion to the strength of this <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise the right of dissent and <span class="highlight">protest</span> within the law - which we ourselves would assert if ever we were in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we note that the Moratorium campaign is more, than an expression of legitimate dissent and1 <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a country where there is unlimited scope for legitimate and lawful freedom of dissent and’ <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the Moratorium tactics are ro be forthrightly condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Acting Prime Minister spoke with all the vehemence he can use on such an occasion to blackguard honourable members on this side of the chamber and people outside Parliament who believe they have a right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we ought not to be involved in the war in Vietnam and repeatedly ask these questions: ‘How did we become involved in this war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole grisly catalogue of the atrocities committed should be well known by now, but I want to put to the House some specific occasions to illustrate my proposition that when these events have occurred and have been canvassed in newspapers there has been no <span class="highlight">protest</span> from honourable members on the other side of the House or from the other people who are associated with the Vietnam Moratorium Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why is there no moratorium, no <span class="highlight">protest</span>, today about these atrocities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it, we ask, and we have continued to ask and 1 continue to ask, that the Vietnam Moratorium Committee will not <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this grisly catalogue of atrocities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They may say: ‘Look, it is our business to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against our own troops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee has less than 2 hours, as I understand it, to debate 18 clauses of the Bill and I add my <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made that <span class="highlight">protest</span>, I now formally ask for leave of the Committee to move the amendments which have been circulated in my name and in the names of other Opposition members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before so doing, I wish to add my <span class="highlight">protest</span> to those of my colleagues on this side of the Committee regarding the way in which this Bill is being rushed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I join with my colleagues, in registering an emphatic <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the guillotining of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not let the opportunity go by without making my <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the farcical situation in the deliberations on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For that reason I support the dignified plea and <span class="highlight">protest</span> of the Opposition which has been made by honourable members on this side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I did mention on that occasion that a large <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting had been held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard a certain gentleman at the farmers’ <span class="highlight">protest</span> march say that if Australia suddenly increased the amount of its aid to poor countries from 1% to  2%  - we have not even reached 1% yet - by some mysterious process all our surpluses of wheat and wool would evaporate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried to make this point yesterday when I pointed out that if we object to certain disruptive elements - strange odd elements who are so publicised in university life these days - and if we <span class="highlight">protest</span> we are doing so because we are footing the bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had they not been extensions of existing colleges 1 would have had to <span class="highlight">protest</span> even against the activities of my own Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span> first of all at the ad hoc nature of this approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Dawson has said, there should have been national priorities - not State priorities, not State begging, not State agitation and nol public <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course everybody knows this now, but we should have known it when the Ord scheme was being considered; then even the short range <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we must not carry out the Burnett and Burdekin proposals before giving something to Western Australia would have been without foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There would have been no basis for protesting that we have to balance the water grants to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ad&gt;’ announcement, however modest, concerning the development of our national water resources seems to bring forth a <span class="highlight">protest</span>, perhaps exemplified earlier in this debate by the interjections of the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  who I am delighted to see has returned to the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This I will deal with, but the water protestants, as I term them, are usually victims of one of our national myths, and that is that we as a nation have spent a great deal of money in the country generally on water conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Tuesday morning I delivered to the Parliament petitions bearing the signatures of 1,000 Western Australians who wanted to register their <span class="highlight">protest</span> at current Government policies of increasing interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to stress the spontaniety of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> which has taken this form and may do so by indicating that the body which has collected these signatures, the Housing Loans Reform Movement, only came into existence a fortnight ago, and it came into existence without any organisational background or backing at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of these categories consists of people whose sole objective is to use the vehicle of demonstration and <span class="highlight">protest</span> for the purposes of denigrating the national service scheme and achieving its repeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>One is that the people could go along to a <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally in their lunch hour if they are workers or in their free time if they are pensioners and <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that is why the resolution was couched in terms which called for <span class="highlight">protest</span> rallies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certain other people have taken advantage of the situation to convert the call for a <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally into a demand for a national stoppage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the committee have leave to report from time to time and that any member of the committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was dramatised effectively in the protests on Monday by sailors against pay conditions at Garden Island in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 200 sailors held a stop-work meeting and walked off 5 Navy ships to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at delays in granting flow-on of allowances made more than a year ago to equivalent civilian personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Opposition is fed up with the way in which it is being treated by the Government and wishes to make its <span class="highlight">protest</span> perhaps by taking up the time of the House, this can be done by adopting other procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can see no connection whatever between photographs being taken at <span class="highlight">protest</span> rallies whether they are taken by police or whether they are taken at the invitation of the protesters as, for example, when they asked photographers to come along and photograph them when they made a violent attack on the house of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As they have made their powerful speeches they have looked out over a great many people and have no doubt misled themselves into the belief that this has been a powerful <span class="highlight">protest</span>, very solidly supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition may deny this relationship as much as he wishes, but I will never be convinced that he did not assist in engineering last Tuesday’s fiasco of Budget <span class="highlight">protest</span> rallies and anti-Budget strikes to serve as a backdrop to his on-stage performance that night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until the Australian people are given full details of what is in this survey of the needs of Australian education, I will continue to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the Australian Labor Party will continue to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That dividend of 11% represents, in reality, a dividend of approximately 50% to 55% to anyone who has taken up all the share options in the period between 1950 and 1970. f ask honourable members to compare these facts and tell me why trade unionists in Australia should not go on strike in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this Budget, why the trade unions in Australia should not be demanding more wages, and why Bob Hawke, the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, should not be going into the arbitration court and demanding from the court or from industry increased wages for the workers and an improvement in their standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ACTU was behind a so-called national strike and <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this Budget which is presently being debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a big fizz, a big flop, lt was drawn to my attention that earlier in the piece this strike was proposed as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Government’s taxation measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span> we must find out what methods of <span class="highlight">protest</span> are lawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if an individual observes these restraints, he has the right to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, however strongly; the right to criticise, however intemperately; the right to draw others to his cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This may be seen in practice in the protection afforded speakers in, say, the Domain in Sydney or the Yarra Bank in Melbourne or in the arrangements made for orderly and prearranged <span class="highlight">protest</span> marches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the comments made by members of the Australian Labor Party and some trade union leaders - I say some because there were many decent, sensible, intelligent union men who did not go on strike last Tuesday - in support of the strike called by the Australian Council of Trade Unions as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> to get political power for the Australian Labor Party, for the Leader of the Opposition and for  Mr Hawke,  if he can win a seat some time after having failed in Corio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By depriving Stale schools of urgently needed basic requirements such as teachers, classrooms, equipment and so on the Liberal-Country Party Government is arousing a ferment of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and resentment against aid for nonState schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In response to the honourable gentleman I do not want to comment about any specific case because the Government’s attitude has been made clear, but I say that if the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Opposition, including the honourable gentleman who has raised the matter, wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span> concerning the refusal to admit  Mr Gregory  let me remind them that, according to a Press report today, the executive of the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign has in fact banned the honourable member for Wills from participating in its proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It occurred to me that  Mr Hawke  could have made a real killing if, instead of advising 1 million or more workers to strike for 3 hours as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Government, he had asked those workers to donate 3 hours of their work time to the old people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But not a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> did we hear from the people who demonstrate so vehemently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, we must indicate an understanding of different points of view, a capacity and a willingness to protect the right to legitimate <span class="highlight">protest</span> and an appreciation of the fact that many people, particularly the younger segment of society, feel great and legitimate concern over aspects of our society that hitherto have been accepted largely without question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just imagine,  Mr Speaker,  the way in which this country would move should we accept without <span class="highlight">protest</span> these kinds of suggestions, this kind of advice, by a Leader of the Opposition that the law should be broken even when it does not need to be broken, and even when the objective can be achieved without it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, I hold up to the House this magnificent publication entitled Two Centuries’ which sets out to show all facets of Australian life and of the Australian people including people engaged in <span class="highlight">protest</span> demonstrations, lt was printed many, many months ago and no doubt it has pride of place in the private libraries of most honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the record was arranged weeks before to give the police a filmed answer to any photographs produced by defendants in any proceedings taken by the police and arising out of this <span class="highlight">protest</span> which of course was known to be about to take place for weeks past and to which question time was devoted for weeks before in denigration and misrepresentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These have been tactfully handled by senior officers in these Services; the men involved also have heaved with restraint once their initial <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I did not have time to say and what I say now is that those who have enjoyed the spirit of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and those who have enjoyed the great fight for civil liberties against law, order and any responsibility in this country may well be reaping the reward sometime in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we had to wait a little longer until we had the case of the Western Australian Government v.

  <li>
    <p>I do not think anybody ought to be proud of legislation validating in retrospect what has already been collected in many cases, what has been sent in to State stamp duty offices in other cases under <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and in still further cases what is awaiting the decision of this House as to whether it has to be sent in in the form of duties from 18th November, when the Hamersley case was first decided, to 30th September, the date decided by that other partner in the present Government coalition, namely the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the main point that I want to raise is that if we can find this S50m - and I say that the amount is near that figure if it is not quite that - we can certainly find a few extra million dollars to reimburse the States for that amount which has not been collected by the States up to 30th September or which has been collected by the States under <span class="highlight">protest</span> and which is the only amount which the States would have to reimburse to taxpayers within the boundaries of their States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that TAA accepted the Government’s decision under <span class="highlight">protest</span> and under duress, for the simple reason that it is a Government authority and for no other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am leading on behalf of the Opposition, and again I must raise some <span class="highlight">protest</span> about this practice because, after all, the measures which we are debating set the pattern in Australia for the next 5 years - at least if this Government continues in office - for the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the British Government is to break the trade agreement with Australia if what the right honourable gentleman says is true, Slid  noi  a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> is heard about ft. What is the use of a trade agreement with a country like Great Britain that is supposed to have been so favourable to Australia if that country is to be allowed to get away with breaking that trade agreement without one word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the responsible Australian Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Department of Civil Aviation has known of the Qantas Boeing 747 programme since 1968, we feel it is necessary to <span class="highlight">protest</span> yet again at the apparent inability of the Department to do its forward planning effectively and at its apparent indifference to the requirements and possible implications of a Committee investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware of a report tabled this week at the National Congress of the Returned Servicemen’s League by Air Vice-Marshal F. M.

    <p>Not a murmer of <span class="highlight">protest</span>, not a twitch of agitation came from him when the last Budget was unveiled to this House - a Budget which gave a miserable 50c a week to a pensioner on $15 a week, or if married, on $13.75 a week with an inferential homily on how the public purse was being strained with this gesture of ‘generosity’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One wonders how much the people who <span class="highlight">protest</span>, so the Minister says, about love scenes are trying to protect themselves from disabusing their own minds on misconceptions they have about sex, love and human relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was unanimously decided by the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association in Queensland at its conference at Surfers Paradise last year that people were starting to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the standard of sex films which were being released in Australia - and believe me, morally these films are the very best of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that in the Committee stage of the Bill I am somewhat restricted in what I can address myself to, but in spite of the earlier comments of the Attorney-General  (Mr Hughes)  that the States had agreed with the Bill and on the composition of the various bodies, I wish to register a very strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> not only at the content of the Bill but also at the way the States have been prepared to step down and hand over their rights to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The McMahon Government now wants to outlaw protests and demonstrations but it makes no attempt to understand what these protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a clearly implied conflict in the reasoning of the former Attorney-General and of most of those who think like him that the public interest is on the one hand and that political <span class="highlight">protest</span> and demonstration are upon the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no concept or suggestion that political demonstration or <span class="highlight">protest</span> could be part of the public interest and could be in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, all one has to show is that somebody who wants to do something for some political purpose, a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or a demonstration, interferes with someone who wants to make money or with someone who wants to use a public office for conscription or to work for the war in Vietnam, or with some diplomat working for apartheid or for the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then all one has to say is that those persons want to use their premises for those purposes and the use of the premises for political <span class="highlight">protest</span> or demonstration has to be swept aside, lt is never in the public interest to make any facilities available for public <span class="highlight">protest</span> and demonstration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is not in the Government’s interest to do that; because as a thoroughly conservative organisation it does not want any <span class="highlight">protest</span> or demonstration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The public interest is never to use the streets for the purpose of a political demonstration or for any other political purpose, although every liberty we have and almost every penny that anyone has these days has come from a background of struggle in which political <span class="highlight">protest</span> and demonstration has won those things for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do take this opportunity to <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we are not given the opportunity to debate this important statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-14-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is deplorable that in recent years representatives of some foreign governments, and their premises, seem to have become increasingly the object of disorderly, and even violent, dissent or <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this I do not dispute, but nevertheless I must <span class="highlight">protest</span> that there are times when freedom is not helped by obeying the law, when the most vital freedoms have to be defended by defying the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think this should be allowed, and it has concerned me that no member of the Labor Party over the last 18 months has raised this matter, inquired into it or appears to have made any <span class="highlight">protest</span> that nothing has been done to bring this man to trial or at least to apprehend him when, I understand, he did not appear on the date fixed to hear the serious charges raised against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Protest</span> marches through city streets have been orderly and under the guidance of the local law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, as a result of the gallant and brave actions of some women in Victoria in going to gaol in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the destroying of human life and in the hope that others might live, there will be more demonstrations by the mothers of our nation against our involvement in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This gives some measure of the seriousness of this motion, and the unbearable unfairness and persistent provocations that have moved the Opposition to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can all appreciate the attitude of members like the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  who only yesterday in this House indicated quite clearly his approach to the new wave or philosophy of dissent and <span class="highlight">protest</span> which is sweeping, apparently, not only this Parliament but also areas outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever there have been demonstrations of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the’ national service scheme the Government has sought to use whatever powers have been available to it to curtail or eliminate such demonstrations and similar activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather it further constricts rights to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and obscures just what is allowed and what is not in the public streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wanted to provide a positive example to all levels of law and regulation in this country, it could have given a positive statement of what it regards as the right to assemble in public for <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the areas of Commonwealth legislative responsibility, it could have listed places where <span class="highlight">protest</span> could be made publicly without liability for penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could have listed times such as Saturdays or Sunday afternoons or off-peak hours when streets or other public places could be used for <span class="highlight">protest</span> without liability for obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could have listed public buildings where peaceful <span class="highlight">protest</span> could be made at certain hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if they want the same privilege to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the treatment of Aboriginals or Vietnam or racist sporting policies there is no way in which they can do so peaceably without exposure to penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a positive acknowledgment were made of the validity of public <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the rights and duties of public dissenters were written into the law, then most of the problems associated with public demonstration in Australia would be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly this sort of <span class="highlight">protest</span> is subject to abuse; in essence, however, it is a form of passive <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been examples in the past few days of the use of a passive presence on Government property to register <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curbs against this sort of <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the Bill before the House do not seem warranted by the history of this sort of demonstration in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been one of the most effective forms of <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the history of dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are legitimate grounds for allowing this form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>, with it stated clearly in the law what is reasonable conduct and what is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restriction on places where reasonable <span class="highlight">protest</span> can be made has the effect of isolating a government completely from criticism of any form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issues of political <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the right to dissent have been dormant in the past few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the possibility of future confrontation, the Government had a golden opportunity to clear the air and define exactly the sort of conduct at public assemblies of <span class="highlight">protest</span> it deemed reasonable and within the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>including a proper consideration of the right and enjoyment of persons to peaceful assembly and peaceful <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the public communication of ideas and social comment and  a  proper balancing of the interests they represent, it constitutes an unreasonable obstruction . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless the Government can provide some legitimate and reasonable excuse for adjourning the Parliament on that day, I believe the Opposition is carrying out its responsibility to the people of this country by protesting in the only way we can <span class="highlight">protest</span> when the Government introduces a motion of this nature to suspend the 11 o’clock rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to speak at great length on this, but 1 do think that it is important for some <span class="highlight">protest</span> to be made in this Parliament about what appears to be the extremely high-handed manner in which this Bill has been framed, whereby the Commonwealth has reserved for itself virtually the right to take money out of the Victorian Treasury if the Victorian Government is able to prove in the High Court that the payroll tax which the Commonwealth has been levying against it is not constitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me record my <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the strongest possible way that I do not believe we ought to pass this Bill this day in this manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I like the use of those words ‘holding Victoria and New South Wales to ransom* particularly in reference to  Sir Henry  Bolte as he is always using them in referring lo brigands, louts, larrikans and other people who <span class="highlight">protest</span> against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Interestingly enough, to continue with the history of this tradition, the then Attorney-General,  Mr Menzies  resigned, to quote the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’, as a most emphatic means of registering his <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  <span class="highlight">protest</span> was against the dropping of this programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 address myself only to the timeliness and I <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the impropriety of bringing this matter forward in this manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is meant to demonstrate, admittedly in just a small way, that we are concerned and that we <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the fact that in spite of all of the Government’s hints, suggestions, promises and implications to the contrary, the Government has still produced no basic rethinking or restructuring of the Australian social welfare system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude by registering my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the manner in which the Leader of the House has notified us tonight of the intentions of the Government in regard to a number of matters that are on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet those who <span class="highlight">protest</span> so strongly against anti-Communist South Africa were strangely silent when the Moscow Circus and the Russian Ballet visited this country early this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some orthodox economists <span class="highlight">protest</span> that governments must be restrained in essential building by clamping these interest charges on top of the capital cost; otherwise, we are told, the Government will overspend and create shortages of labour and materials, building costs will skyrocket, and there will be increasing use of overtime, insufficiently skilled labour on this type of work and overaward payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both of those honourable gentlemen said that the honourable member for Sturt had done nothing more than <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passage I have quoted shows and the rest of his speech confirms that he did not <span class="highlight">protest</span> simply against the secrecy; he protested against the bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the final paragraph of his letter, he asks whether it is not about time that some direct action were taken and that the people of Kingsford-Smith - the people in my electorate - virtually stormed on to the tarmac and occupied the whole of the terminal area to show some form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The young man’s counter reaction may manifest itself in <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and it is then that society groups itself as though for civil war - the establishment versus the youth - without either side understanding or trying to understand each other’s position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is this high protection and industry is making huge profits then of course the Labor Party will cry out in <span class="highlight">protest</span> but it never crys out against the cause of the high profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hesitate to think how many Parents’ and Citizens’ Associations meet regularly in Canberra not just to discuss whether they can meet the tuckshop expenses but to <span class="highlight">protest</span> vigorously about the teacher turnover, the low state of morale that exists in the schools here and matters of that sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, I wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the haste with which this legislation is being pushed through the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that such people have a choice and a voice with which they are allowed to express a choice or to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, which right is denied to a serviceman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight I register my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at having to debate in this Parliament at a time when most members are not in a state to absorb the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 also <span class="highlight">protest</span> very strongly about the long delay since the last reference to the Tariff Board and its consideration by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the appropriate Minister: Can he tell me whether any <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made about the French nuclear tests in the Pacific and whether any <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been made about the American nuclear test last weekend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If no <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been made, why has a different course been adopted in the case of the French tests from that adopted in the case of the American test? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of motor vehicle bodies being constructed to last longer it would seem to me that manufacturers are concerned mainly with securing as rapid a turnover as possible without too much <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the next few days I intend to call a <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting in the central west which will be heard from one end of this nation to the other because I am fed up to the teeth with the way country airports and air services have completely deteriorated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 dare say that, as usual, this sort of attack upon parliamentary democracy, even though 1 concede that that was only in its beginnings in Thailand - nevertheless it was a start - will not cause any official Australian Government <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the situation in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has in many instances, with a terrible heartlessness, deprived low income groups of houses which they did not want to part with, so much so, that as recently as August of this year, no fewer than 250 residents of Fitzroy which is in my electorate marched in <span class="highlight">protest</span> into the Brooks Crescent area, where the Commission was attempting to have a demolition order placed on the street so that the houses could be torn down to make way for another high-rise ant-hill; in answer to the demand for more houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course there should be loud howls of <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the hundreds, and possibly even thousands of would-be university students who are not able to get to universities because of the operation of quotas on the one hand and by the high fees that are being demanded of them on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that we can keep doing is to prod the Government and <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the hope not that its conscience will in some way alter its future record, but that the Australian community will get the message in some way and realise that the record speaks for itself, that people should be judged on what they do, not on what they do not say while simply getting on the bandwaggon and trying to take advantage of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister misled Parliament on 9th September last year when he claimed that he had sent a formal letter of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Prime Minister of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the very reason why opponents of apartheid last year were utterly unconvinced by his claim that the best and only way to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against apartheid was through the responsible and formal official channels that he was using. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly however, he even stooped to asking the South African Embassy officials here whether they would be upset if he sent a second - or rather a first-letter of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ordinances were introduced in October last year, and promptly a number of complaints were made by local parents and citizens associations protesting about the increase and the effect it would have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have been told, and I accept, that a number of other parents and citizens associations discussed the problem but passed no resolutions of <span class="highlight">protest</span> because they were persuaded - and it is a common view held in this city of Canberra - that once an ordinance has been introduced it is too late to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The distinct lack of substance which has emanated from the Opposition this evening amply substantiates the suggestion made by the honourable member for Sturt that the Opposition should have made one speech and then sat down as a matter of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise this matter of public importance because yesterday newspapers throughout Australia carried a report of a call to Australians to occupy the streets of Melbourne in a <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor MHR for Lalor,  Dr Cairns,  called yesterday foi a mass ‘return to the streets in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the intensified war in Vietnam*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the newspaper article, which refers to a call by the honourable member for Lalor for a mass ‘return to the streets in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the intensified war in Vietnam’.- Has the Government no feeling for what has happened in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Across the world the communists have contrived and presented a process of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and mass manipulation of public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference is this: With the communists clearly staging an unprovoked, major offensive, suddenly the great many voices of <span class="highlight">protest</span> are silent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">protest</span> and sabotage of the Government’s defence policies from 1954 onwards, when they joined the Communist Party in denouncing our decision to send troops to help the British defend Malaya. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1963 there were blanket increases in rentals in zone 5 and this led to an outburst of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The settlers then protested to the then Premier of South Australia,  Sir Thomas  Playford, and he offered rentals at various rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This should reinforce the strength and sincerity of our <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the resumption of these tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, we must not give the impression that our protests are mere formalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before these accurate assessments become official by the announcement of the Prime Minister at the completion of the day’s proceedings, we have the ridiculous spectacle of the Premiers presenting claims and the Commonwealth protesting that the demands cannot be met and recommending lesser amounts as an alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the offer by the Commonwealth the Premiers <span class="highlight">protest</span> that they cannot balance their Budgets on the amount offered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They discovered the formal wording and subsequently they forwarded a petition, not in the hope that it would find the same unhappy end that my letters, telegrams and speech in the Parliament had found, but hoping that their <span class="highlight">protest</span> might be treated with some dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, I am not suggesting that if a member walks into  this  House and says that his electors in Cooktown  or  some other part  of  Australia  wish  to put forward something, because there are only 10 signatures that person or those people should not have an opportunity to have their <span class="highlight">protest</span> heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the protests were not in petition form members of the Australian Country Party went as a block with an armful of these protests and presented them to the then Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of explanation may I say that for about 4 hours last Saturday a Mustang aircraft chartered by the Army flew in roughly a circle at a height of about 1,500 feet over a residential area in my electorate, returning to each point in the pattern at about every 2 minutes and that an officer of the Department of Civil Aviation informed me at the time of my inquiry about the matter that 24 people individually had telephoned to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he discuss with the Prime Minister a further possible <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the South African Government against its racial sporting policies as mentioned by the Prime Minister on 9th September 1971 (Hansard, page 989)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statutory responsibility for determining this falls upon the Parliament, for better or for worse, I do not know of any occasion, or at least I cannot recall one, when emoluments of officers in this category have been adjusted without there being some <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also join my voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the limited time available in this House to backbench members, especially backbench members of the Opposition, to adequately represent their electors by having the chance to speak or to ask questions on matters which con cern them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The original wording has been watered down to the word ‘hazard’, which we have accepted with <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and this has been one of the excuses that have been used for reducing the time allotted to the warning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not deny the right of people to <span class="highlight">protest</span> provided that in doing so they do not deny other people the freedom which they demand for themselves, and provided they <span class="highlight">protest</span> without senselessly damaging property belonging to other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he assure the House on the afternoon of 6th April 1971 (Hansard, page 1456) that he has already communicated a <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the South African Government against its exclusion of black South Africans from this team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of his statement that his <span class="highlight">protest</span> was communicated to the South African authorities before he made his statement on the afternoon of 6th April 1971, will he now state at precisely what time (a) he instructed the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs to convey the <span class="highlight">protest</span> and (b) the Secretary conveyed the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A similar viewpoint has been taken by the rel* vant committee of the Parliament of Western Australia, namely, that the tent in front of the West Australian Parliament House, which is a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the conditions of Aboriginal housing in Western Australia, should ultimately be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially, the Federal Government tolerated the embassy, but as the issue became more of a thorn - and the <span class="highlight">protest</span> more effective - it foreshadowed the introduction of an ordinance to clear the tents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal embassy’s letter told the Queen that, if the ordinance is allowed to become law, it is likely to result in a serious abrogation of the rights of all Australians, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, to bring before the Federal Parliament a continuous peaceful <span class="highlight">protest</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But outside this Parliament was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> of the heart, which was by no means ineffective ia speaking to the conscience of Australia in the persons of thousands of tourists -and others who visit this city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation does not restrict the traditional rights of freedom of speech or assembly or the rights of people to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental fact remains that the Government was faced with the situation in which any <span class="highlight">protest</span> group or minority group, whether they be fascists, Croatians, unionists, pensioners, wool growers, wheat growers - you name it - could camp with impunity on the lawns outside this building or on unleased land in the city area of the national capital, Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the use of the lawns in front of Parliament House and the second is the question of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by Aboriginal  people  here and in other parts of Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make this clear: If there is to be <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the way in which the Government has been handling the affairs of the Aboriginal people, particularly since the Government took over control and responsibility for the Aboriginal people as a result of the referendum in 1967, then it is right that the House and the Australian people should know how much we have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the failure of this Government to understand what land means to the Australian Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a very modest <span class="highlight">protest</span> but it became a major symbol in the eyes of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government made the <span class="highlight">protest</span> a more effective <span class="highlight">protest</span> by its own precipitate action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has been protesting against all atmospheric testing, not in a selective way excluding Communist countries and being soft with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude that has been taken by people who support resolutions of that kind, including this present Government, is that they will not <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the testing of nuclear weapons by one nation but only against all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To sum up for myself against the charges made by the honourable member for La Trobe; I have protested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did <span class="highlight">protest</span> against Russian nuclear tests when they were being performed in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, have discussions taken place with New Zealand which, like Australia, is an ally of France, and which, earlier this year, lodged a <span class="highlight">protest</span> with the French Government over the impending tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has on numerous occasions in the past clearly stated its opposition to such tests to the French Government both through public statements and through the delivery of official <span class="highlight">protest</span> notes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it was in 1966 or 1967 that I had occasion to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, in particular when the late  Mr Holt  was Prime Minister, at the reluctance to give any information about water conservation or construction projects in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Treasurer listened to the voice of <span class="highlight">protest</span> in Western Australia and paid attention to the current signing of petitions in this regard he would take another look at the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can only regard the action by the people concerned as being in very poor taste and interfering with the rights of individuals to conduct their worship - in this case, Mass at the Cathedral throughout Sunday - and I hope that people who desire to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in some way or another will respect the rights of people to worship in this country as they so wish, without this sort of impediment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prime Minister and wife second class visitors and not worthy of hospitality extended to foreign heads of state stop In declining invitation in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at Government’s mean and paltry approach to this visit desire to state that if Government can afford to regularly send Ministers public servants and their wives on luxury trips abroad members and wives invited to official functions of this kind in honour of such a distinguished personage should be entitled to expect adequate financial provision will be made by Government to enable them to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the test of protests in the ultimate is to be found in dignity - not dignity in any snob sense, but dignity in terms of resolution but at the same time dignity in terms of advancing a cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were of any race on the face of the earth who sought in this way to extend their <span class="highlight">protest</span>, I would seek to discourage them, not on the ground of seeking to daunt them at all in prosecuting their cause but rather in the firm belief that it was so useless, so forlorn, and not achieving what they seek to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only because there was some <span class="highlight">protest</span> on this side of the House from honourable members who wanted to talk on this matter that finally the Government was forced to adjourn the debate to another time and so we are given the opportunity now to discuss it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But for years we have seen the spectacle of leading members of this Parliament - those who now sit on the Government benches - advocating rule by demonstration, rule by violent <span class="highlight">protest</span> and in fact the circumvention of the democratic processes by which a government is elected and given a mandate to carry out its policies and by which the people can change that government if its actions no longer appeal to the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  some years ago I supported the principle of lowering the voting age for the very simple reason that I felt that young people, instead of being compelled, because of a lack of another means of expressing their views, to indulge in violence and <span class="highlight">protest</span> should be integrated into the parliamentary system, should have the opportunity to convince fellow citizens that their views were right, should be able to elect members to the Parliament and should be able to bring about by parliamentary means the reforms they desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst Australia has less cause to <span class="highlight">protest</span> than other countries in terms of actual fallout on its territory, we are in a position of some influence in the Pacific and we can assist the protests of smaller Pacific nations whose real concern when expressed individually, may not be accorded much weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, our predecessors had taken the attitude that no useful purpose would be served by making protests, that they should not be made and that we would be on rather weak ground in making a formal <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> note which I made to Yugoslavia is completely valid and the whole question is unaffected by the fact that the Attorney-General and the Ambassador did not inform the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He left his  deputy  as Acting Prime Minister, failing to give rum any information and allowing the Acting Prime Minister to look as big a fool as the Prime Minister looked when he sent the Australian Ambassador to make the <span class="highlight">protest</span> in Zagreb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>because of the limitations imposed by the problem of dual nationality, and since, in  Mr Grskovic’s  case, there is no evidence that he has been denied the normal protection of Yugoslav law, I feel that the Australian Government would be on weak ground in registering a formal <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Affairs,  Mr  Whitlam, has sent a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span>  to  the  Government of Yugoslavia  at their  failure to  inform  the Australian Government of the arrest,  trial and  execution of 3 persons who, as naturalised Australians were regarded by Australia as having been entitled to the full protection accorded to all Australian nationals charged with offences against the laws of third countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> note pointed out that Australia’s feelings were stronger in view of the active measures taken by the new Australian Government against terrorist activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commenting on- the Government’s <span class="highlight">protest</span>  Mr Whitlam  said the Australian Government had a policy of clear opposition to the use of the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All we have had is a formal, restrained, limited <span class="highlight">protest</span> note from the Prime Minister, not a sign of the outrage that would follow if the Labor Party had these executions thrust upon it from a non-communist country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has made it plain that there will be no further <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Yugoslav Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, notwithstanding what the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  put - I tried to correct him by interjection - we did send a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note to the Government of Yugoslavia when we discovered what had happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the House that one of the Prime Minister’s first acts towards one of this country’s most friendly international neighbours was to deliver a strong note of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the  President  of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sent a strong note of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Yugoslav Government once we knew what the facts or some of the facts were, followed up with the notes which the Prime Minister read out in the chamber and the letters about the other 10 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: ‘Because of certain suggestions’ - one was the aide-memoire that had been received from the Yugoslav Government at the time - ‘it might not be appropriate to make a <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this stage it is just a matter of sending <span class="highlight">protest</span> notes at the diplomatic level through the Australian Ambassador in Belgrade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I argued against a <span class="highlight">protest</span> being made in that context at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In doing so I record my <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Opposition Parties at the amount of time which the Government has been prepared to allow for debate on this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Tramways Board, by going to the High Court, was frustrating the desire of the Commissioner in his attempts to settle this dispute the union was involved in a number of stoppages over the issue in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the action of the Tramways Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I begin on a mild note of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and that is to this effect: I understand it is the wish of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the House will simply have to hear more of this because the evasion that has been witnessed by us has been tremendous, and I <span class="highlight">protest</span> on this occasion and I hope that the Opposition, if it continues, will take stronger action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reminded also that with all his great outcry he still sat silently by while the Australian Country Party sold its wheat to Red China - as it was called at that time - and he did not utter a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> about that at any stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">protest</span>, as with similar protests in previous years, was conveyed in the strongest terms, and the French nuclear weapon tests at Mururoa Atoll were repeatedly deplored and condemned by the Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 did have discussions with the Prime Minister of New Zealand who, as the right honourable gentleman will be aware, had already indicated that, as a part of his Government’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, New Zealand would be sending a frigate to the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a preface, I refer him to his Press conference of 8th May at which, in reply to the question ‘Have you had any response from the Chinese Government on your <span class="highlight">protest</span> note on the nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>’, he said: ‘The <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China was oral, so there would be no written response’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> took the form of  a  letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr Chi  Peng-fei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, precisely what form did the Australian <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China take? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was a written <span class="highlight">protest</span>, does the Prime Minister expect a response? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I asked the Prime Minister about the Chinese <span class="highlight">protest</span> note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I asked about the fact that the Prime Minister had stated that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> note was oral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in supplying an answer to a question on notice to the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  for inclusion in the Senate Hansard he stated that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> took the form of a letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point on which I should like to make my <span class="highlight">protest</span> is that, while it is not an offence to sell this type of glass for use in windscreens, nor is it an offence to sell faulty safety helmets, seat belts or mag wheels, it is an offence for a person to fit them and to use them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard honourable members on the other side of the House <span class="highlight">protest</span> strongly that this legislation will not lead to what Opposition members suggest it possibly could lead to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is along this line that I raise my <span class="highlight">protest</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Australian Government taken any action to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against (a) the judicial murder of a family of 5 Iraqi Jews in Baghdad and the previous public hanging of Jews in that city; (b) the detention and murder of Pakistani prisoners-of-war in Indian POW camps; and (c) the judicial murder of Asian and Ugandan citizens in Uganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, this is one of the main reasons why the primary producers of Australia finally revoked and took part in <span class="highlight">protest</span> marches in respect of the wheat industry, the wool industry and other industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that there is a responsibility on it to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in a vigorous way and for that purpose it has instituted proceedings before the International Court of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the Government’s view that emphasis should be placed on this <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much so that in August 1971 no fewer than 250 residents of North Fitzroy, which is in my electorate, marched in <span class="highlight">protest</span> into the Brookes Crescent area where the Housing Commission was attempting to have a demolition order placed on the whole area, so that the houses could be torn down to make way for another high rise anthill, in answer to the demand for more houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the residents pointed out to the protesters that it was ironical and incongruous that potentially good houses should be pulled down against the wishes of the owners to make way for flats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my previous speech on this subject I said that we were right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then on 8 May he put forward the extraordinary position that there had been an oral <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese Government about their tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when he was asked whether he would expect a reply, he said no, he would not expect a reply to his <span class="highlight">protest</span> because it had been an oral <span class="highlight">protest</span> and therefore there would not be any reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a written answer to a question on the Senate notice paper he said that in fact the <span class="highlight">protest</span> note had been a written <span class="highlight">protest</span> note which had been handed to the Chinese Foreign Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So under any measurement, there is a very real case for Australia being consistent in its opposition to atmospheric nuclear testing and, if we are going to the extreme of taking the French to the World Court, we should certainly place a much stronger <span class="highlight">protest</span> with the Chinese than the one which was firstly described as an oral <span class="highlight">protest</span> to which, therefore, we would receive no reply and which secondly was seen to be a written <span class="highlight">protest</span> and to which still we do not know whether we are to receive any reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to be consistent - if this Prime Minister is to have any credibility in the eyes not only of Australians but also of the world - then he must <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese as well as to the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second is the text of a <span class="highlight">protest</span> by 17,000 Catholics in Lithuania dated 27 March 1972 and refers to the systematic religious persecution going on in that country in contravention of the Soviet constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his <span class="highlight">protest</span> note on the nuclear tests, he said that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China was oral so there would be no written response? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia’s Ambassador to China, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,  lodged a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note with the Chinese Assistant Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not necessary for him to read the report of the conference in the daily Press to know that he had stated unequivocally that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China was oral and that for that reason he did not expect a written response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transcript states quite clearly that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China was oral so that there would be no written response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs he should have been aware that the Ambassador to China whom he appointed had stated in a radio interview that a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note had been lodged with the Chinese Assistant Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked whether the Australian Government had made a <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese Government about that country’s nuclear atmospheric testing, whether there had been a <span class="highlight">protest</span> and whether it had been verbal or written. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Senator Willesee  replied that a <span class="highlight">protest</span> had been lodged and that it had taken the form of a letter from the Foreign Minister to the Chinese Foreign Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, who is also Foreign Minister, must have written the letter of <span class="highlight">protest</span> himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the Opposition makes the strongest <span class="highlight">protest</span> it can against the Government’s action in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  would <span class="highlight">protest</span> very strongly if water in his electorate was taken away and sent down to Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just a few days ago a group of young Australian women at the Barham High School, which is right on the Murray River - there were about a dozen of them - wrote to me to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The discrimination that they protested about was that a few yards away is an area which has tertiary institutions that they would like to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In speaking against or to, whichever way one might interpret it, the motion moved by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison),  who is at the table, I wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span>– <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take advantage of this opportunity to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this debate being gagged just before 12.45 p.m. today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member cares to recall, when he stirs the Returned Services League to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, the very strenuous protests he received as Minister for Repatriation about the woeful inadequacy of the pensions that were paid to totally and premanently incapacitated ex-servicemen and general rate pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have documents in my possession concerning those protests but I will not bother the House with them because most honourable members who have been in this House for a time are familiar with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easy enough to make loud noises of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course when we listened to the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  when he opened the proceedings this evening on this measure, we heard him debase the currency of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Postmaster-General is aware, I have already made representations to him following a large <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting at Quambatook some weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to voice the most vehement <span class="highlight">protest</span> about this bungling that has been going on and the way in which the people in these areas have been treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not good enough and I voice my <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Country Party make that <span class="highlight">protest</span>,  Mr Speaker,  because we are concerned for the small investor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of this, there has been no <span class="highlight">protest</span> from either the Australian Medical Association or members of the Opposition, some of whom seem to be well briefed spokesmen for at least parts of the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then again, there has been no <span class="highlight">protest</span> from either of these groups in the past in spite of the fact that most of us who are members of health insurance funds have to carry some sort of membership card which is numbered and which we have to return to the fund when we make an application for medical or hospital benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the interesting features of this whole debate, apart from the contributions made by Country Party supporters, is that both the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  and I as the Minister representing the Minister for the Media have not received one <span class="highlight">protest</span> about this increase from the Federation of Australian Broadcasting Stations and we have not received one <span class="highlight">protest</span> from any broadcasting station throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the strongest possible terms against this action taken by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  It is an outrage and a flagrant misuse of the forms of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was never any <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the past about the fact that most of the senior secondary scholarships - 25,000 last year, tenable this year - went to children in the higher socio-economic bracket and that as a consequence of that most of those who go on to tertiary education come from that socio-economic group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At meeting after meeting of meat producers, not only in my own area but in other areas as well I found meat producers threatening to keep their meat from the market in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the meat tax which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro so blithely tried to defend tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only when this Government’s policies on foreign ownership began to bite that we began to hear these cries of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Government’s policies and performances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to walk out without voting and take no part in it as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against what has happened to that magnificent report of March 1970 after  2i  years of hard work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened is that the members of the Country Party are trying to paint a false picture, but what concerns me about these sectional gentlemen is that they are giving the impression to the Australian people, who are mostly in the cities, that the currency of <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been so debased that no one from the countryside can be believed in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after hearing the debasement of the currency of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the extravagant language and the inadequate expression of opinion that we hear from members of the Country Party on minor matters, we find that the genuine case has already been destroyed because of their being extravagant and being in fact the worst propagandists since  Dr Joseph  Goebbels met his untimely end, or perhaps it was a timely end, in the bunker in Berlin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight I want to raise again my voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the procrastination of Ministers of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development which is proceeding bears no relationship to the debased currency of <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we hear from the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by reminding honourable members that yesterday the Prime Minister told this House that he had made strong protests in China about Chinese nuclear atmospheric testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he made such a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span>, why was there no mention of it in the final communique? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such a contention does no credit to him or any member of this Parliament who would listen to him without raising voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this stage is about the lack of prior time for consideration of a measure which, as will be shown later in this Committee discussion, is a radically different approach and one which therefore calls for a lot of consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With 5 minutes of the debate on this Bill remaining it is unfair of me to hold the floor any longer, but I would like to record my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the manner in which this Bill has been rushed through the Parliament with so little discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the time when I sat on the other side of the House I raised my voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> and my vote was in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against what took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one wonders whether his procrastination is designed to destroy the purposes of the Aged Persons Homes Act, because he can <span class="highlight">protest</span> that there is a $2 for $1 subsidy whilst on the other hand the ceiling limit remains and the whole scheme is strangled by the financial inability of the organisations building this type of accommodation to set their contributions at such a high level either that it means it is impossible for occupants to pay it or alternatively that it means it is impossible to raise the funds through fetes and similar fund raising activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Opposition in this House not make some <span class="highlight">protest</span> about that sort of restriction and intrusion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again raise a <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Opposition at the way in which I, as Opposition spokesman on health and social security, and all honourable members on this side of the Parliament are being forced to debate a document which is one of the most important documents that has been tabled in this Parliament in many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in dramatic contrast to the proposition floated by the last Government to reduce expenditure by the ABC in the field of public affairs, but fortunately this exercise was withdrawn after debate and <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I was absent overseas at the time I did not have an opportunity in any of the debates on the various Bills implementing the Government’s Budget decisions to make my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at what I regard as a most vicious kind of discrimination in which the Government has indulged against the people who live in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of my Party and my constituents at the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main <span class="highlight">protest</span> by Liberal members when the Bill went through the House was directed against the higher charges levied on country newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition makes howls of <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the undemocratic driving through of a BUI which is not to be adequately debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I suggest to the honourable member that the next time letters of <span class="highlight">protest</span> come in from Gympie, apart from some of them being in similar handwriting and  air  of them appearing on the same sort of notepaper it might be advisable not to send them all in one envelope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise to continue my <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of those constituents of mine - and possibly yours,  Mr Deputy Speaker  - who have constantly complained at the inability to get any Government to decide to apply a night curfew to Perth Airport or to arrive at a final decision as to its resiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From time to time members of the public and conservation groups <span class="highlight">protest</span> about proposals to mine, clear or otherwise alter important natural areas but the real conflict is that, with the demand for productive use of resources being now so widespread, it is affecting some of the last natural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the Minister’s disparaging and inaccurate remarks, as usual, about the noise I was making or about my not having done anything about this - that was a complete falsehood - on referendum day in 1967 I was in the lead of a <span class="highlight">protest</span> procession marching down the street carrying banners bearing such words as ‘60,000 voteless voices’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because he persists in his pomposity, the only solution for the defence of Australia is that this man should resign as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> at what his Government has done to him, if he seriously believes in the statement he made tonight that he is advancing Australia’s defence cause instead of destroying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has not made any formal <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Spanish Government concerning these matters, but its strong opposition to any deprivation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Craigieburn lies within the State electorate of Gisborne, but the gentleman who represents the area has not joined with the deputations or even crooned a <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the lack of an adequate and modern rail service to either Craigieburn or Sunbury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However much the Government may <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the contrary, however much it may twist and distort figures and however much it may emphasise individual cases and incidents and attempt to make people believe that black is white and white is black, this has been the experience of the overwhelming majority of- Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, in those circumstances, and in those circumstances only, on behalf of the Opposition I raise the strongest possible <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this outrage and very reluctantly grant leave to the Leader of the House to move his motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition did not <span class="highlight">protest</span> too greatly tonight, except in that mild way, because if he called a division now there would hardly be a dozen Liberals in the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, at the same time a <span class="highlight">protest</span> demonstration was taking place outside Parliament House in which representatives of the Aboriginal population were involved and an incident occurred which caused widespread criticism throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can understand that there should be <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings in country areas about the removal of the superphosphate bounty, but the question that should be being asked and, I hope, answered, is: Why should this one item of farming costs be singled out to be given an artificial price? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I register my <span class="highlight">protest</span> that arrangements which probably allow metropolitan members to be in their electorates on Anzac Day but which deny that privilege to members who live in outlying areas are just not good enough in relation to a day as important as Anzac Day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that 6,000 farmers, in an unprecedented show of unity, met at Subiaco Oval in peaceful and orderly <span class="highlight">protest</span> the same afternoon has been given no or scant regard by the daily Press, while the antics of a group of alleged farmers demonstrating in Forrest Place have been blazed in headlines across the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anything is good enough to attack the Labor Party on, but some fair and just criticism of the activities of those who manipulate the Country Party from their city dwellings and other places immediately brings forward this phoney storm of <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the Leader of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, at a <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting at Maryborough the  Chairman  of the Maryborough Branch of the Transport Workers Union was moved to acquaint the meeting of the fact that the Transport Workers Union State Executive decision to apply a black ban had been made without reference to the Maryborough Branch and further that the Maryborough Branch was absolutely opposed to the introduction of such a ban. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But was the honourable gentleman moved to write a letter of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Minister for Science in terms of affection and familiarity which now sweep over the Labor Party, starting off ‘Dear Bill, the views which you have expressed certainly do not represent my views’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, and more importantly, what humbug it is for a member of the Opposition to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the taxing of pensions when the Opposition proposed this very thing in this House and when the former Minister for Social Services, who has spoken in this debate, mentioned that this was a practice which would have been followed had the Opposition been a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because, although members from this side of the House were present at the <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting at the Sydney Domain on Sunday and although no members from the Government side of the House were present, I understand that 2 members from the Government side of the Parliament have associated themselves with this <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am informed that he has made some kind of <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this regard but, as it happens - it is unusual in the case of a  Deputy  Prime Minister- his <span class="highlight">protest</span> has passed unregarded and no publicity has been accorded to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the  Deputy  Prime Minister is honest in this, as I am sure he must be - we should give him the credit of being honest in this - I am sure that he would like publicly to be associated with this <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">protest</span> is being made by a member of the Government, by a Government Minister, by a  Deputy  Prime Minister, it should be accorded the whole weight of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should - perhaps it will - associate itself with this <span class="highlight">protest</span> publicly so that the Australian people can know where it stands in relation to cases such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Soviet Union has demonstrated the most utter hypocrisy in regard to human rights and I think it is time that the Government officially associated itself with a <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister at the table will not be able to give an opinion off the cuff but I ask him to see that this matter is referred to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  so that when the Parliament meets for the Budget session he will be able to tell us that an official <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been made to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Government deliver <span class="highlight">protest</span> notes to the Chinese and French Governments on 18 June 1974 for exploding nuclear devices in the atmosphere; if not, what form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> took place; if so, were the notes in the same terms, or were they identical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the note to the French Government a stronger <span class="highlight">protest</span> in any respect; if so, why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the notes in each case a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against atmospheric testing, or testing in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the Notes in each case was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many ways he led the <span class="highlight">protest</span> which was registered with France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that we can let this matter go by without making our full <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the success of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty depends on the effective containment of nuclear testing, I ask whether Australia has made any <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if all the people, including those in the Law Society, who are protesting today were to <span class="highlight">protest</span> during a declared emergency they would be subject to arrest and penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would venture to say that today’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> outside Parliament House in Western Australia would be impossible under the terms of the Bill which suspends our proud West Australian heritage, our democratic constitution in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This pressure could take place only before the Bill becomes law because when it is law no person will be able to <span class="highlight">protest</span> for fear of an emergency being declared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The first thing I want to do is to lodge a <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Opposition that this very important Budget Bill should be introduced into the House for consideration in detail by the Parliament before the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  has had a chance to present to the Parliament his analysis of the Budget as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will leave that aside but will get to the fact that in my State, anyway, elected Labor Party senators and others in the State field are refusing to attend growers’ meetings when they wish to register their protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they must be allowed the right to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and they will <span class="highlight">protest</span> tremendously when every country investment in a country town is hit by increased telephone charges or, if you like, petrol charges, because people in those areas use those facilities almost entirely for their job- to earn their income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party has moved an amendment along the lines that we accept this legislation but that we do so under a form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> also at the sense of Government control that permeates the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it any wonder that members of the Opposition attend <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting after <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting and appeal to rural producers not to take extreme action, despite their anger and frustration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of injustice, unfairness and inequity that the Liberal and Country Parties <span class="highlight">protest</span> about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But they never <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the exposed and denied position of so many people in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tasmanian members were concerned enough then to <span class="highlight">protest</span> belatedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that one out of five of them is in the chamber for this Bill shows that the <span class="highlight">protest</span> was rather short-lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact they comprise the least likely section of the community to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at any level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  about the decision taken to ship Christmas Island phosphate rock in Australian ships whenever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sometimes it is nothing more than a <span class="highlight">protest</span> and so we had the many Vietnam moratoriumsthe protests when a government, through its bloody-mindedness and its refusal to recognise the change in public opinion, had to put up with and was confronted with protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So it is that in Ringwood in the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for Cas.sey  (Mr Mathews),  1,200 to 1,500 people attended a meeting on Sunday to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about a freeway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter were mainly Japanese made, since the trigger for the <span class="highlight">protest</span> was an official visit by Premier Tanaka of Japan, the country whose businessmen have been the most visible and the most resented foreign operators in Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been significant pressures from quite a wide variety of people- trade unions, academics, students, lawyers, civil liberties groups, aid groups, for example- and these have all been making an impression on the Australian Government to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Indonesian Government over the continued detention without trial of people charged with involvement in the 1965 attempted coup and the recent trials of intellectuals who were arrested after the January riots in Djakarta to which I have just referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that, having regard to what was said during the debate this afternoon by several honourable gentlemen opposite, there would have been some measure of <span class="highlight">protest</span> within the Government Party itself at the ramming through of a Bill of this highly complex nature in a matter of, as things go now, 65 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee of the Parents’ and Friends’ Association of St. Leo’s College, Box Hill, wishes to register a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of parents, at the decision announced in the recent Federal Budget, to reduce allowable taxation deductions for education expenses from $400 to $ 1 SO per child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very senior Army officer, Brigadier Hooton who last year resigned as the head of Army intelligence in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against cuts in defence expenditure, has pointed out that Japan, China and India, as well as the Soviet Union, have the nuclear capacity to threaten Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I questioned him on this matter in the House and asked him whether at any time he made his <span class="highlight">protest</span> through the proper channel-through the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly the strongest <span class="highlight">protest</span> about aircraft noise is led by people who are not regularly or consistently subjected to the noise but who go into the area to make an assessment or appraisal and are rather shocked by the intensity of the noise, whereas people who live there and are conditioned to the noise find in time that it is not intolerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that if there had been a diplomatic <span class="highlight">protest</span> I would have heard of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Liberal and Country Parties <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we have not given the rural areas money for roads although we have a new national highway which, incidentally, traverses country areas because that is the only way it can join cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it was a speech on which I would commend him, because the information given was along the lines of the informed material that many members of this House had given to the Minister and along the lines of the information contained in the Spring Report which had been prepared in relation to the proposed Galston airport by the Galston Airport <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I do not think that it is a right and proper way in which to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point I wish to raise in particular is that there are numerous occasions when members of the Opposition are provoked into trying to make some sort of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against what goes on in the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, honourable members opposite, who represent in the main those who are the major owners of income earning property, can be expected to <span class="highlight">protest</span> vigorously against any tax that brings property into the tax base, but that does not invalidate the argument for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who has given anything to a charity and anyone who has ever benefited from the work of these organisations must continue in their public <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the possibility that tax deductibility for gifts to these organisations could be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lest it be imagined that my <span class="highlight">protest</span> has the effect of totally disassociating myself from the League of Rights, I would say that this is a matter of small concern to me, apart from my categoric denial that I am a member of the League of Rights or that I hold brief for its purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) That paragraph ( 12) of the resolution of appointment of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of the Parliament be omitted and that the following paragraph be substituted: ‘(12) That the Committee report within the shortest reasonable period, not later than 29 May 1975, and that any member of the Committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week in this House I spoke of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> organised by doctors in East Bentleigh who arranged a private meeting for which a person required an invitation to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The doctors who have organised the <span class="highlight">protest</span> have lodged appeals with the local government about the construction of the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the public meeting called to support this centre it was agreed- not unanimously because some of the protesting doctors were present- that this was widening the choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it might be to the benefit of the public if some of the protesting doctors and some of the Liberal members who were invited to the doctors’ meeting considered why the community needs a community health centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also have to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the propositions floated at the recent Australian Wool Industry Conference where the Minister’s representative indicated that the Minister would not choose people who were beyond 65 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For a paraphernalia of this description to be created and to be passed through this Parliament without complaint would mean that the Parliament of the country had lost its capacity to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early days the States protested greatly but that <span class="highlight">protest</span> has now been muted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the residents of the electorate of Griffith which, at this moment of speaking still exists, despite the instructions of the Minister for Services and Property that it be totally eliminated, and on behalf of the people of Queensland who spoke so loudly on 7 December last year when some 25 Australian Labor Party State members lost their seats in the State Parliament, I <span class="highlight">protest</span> most loudly at the fact that the Australian Parliament is not sitting for a reasonable period at a time when this nation is in one big mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not call it a <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not want the word ‘<span class="highlight">protest</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So really my purpose in taking part in this debate is to record a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which we have been treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly one should not be able to do that without some right to appeal, to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and to put a second point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Country Party are now going around the countryside stirring up trouble amongst the beef producers of Australia, holding <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings and condemning this Government but never putting forward anything constructive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequences are that yesterday outside the House a PRG tent was illegally established and no <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made because the Government was doing what the conference had directed it to do and members of this House, who make up this Government, were involved in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to be asociated with this debate as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the treatment that is being handed out to a significant contributor to Australia’s overseas reserves, to an industry which has made a meaningful contribution to improving the quality of life of the Australian people generally over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Country Party will not get too many invitations to cattle <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings in Queensland any more because their tactics and strategy are to divide the cattle industry and to cause confusion and disarray in it so that they can blame the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall refer only briefly to the Technical and Further Education Commission report where, under the guidelines that have been put forward, the Commission has very courageously registered its <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this sort of attitude being taken, instead of it being allowed to report on the needs and letting the Government take the responsibility for saying what it would responsibly see as the expenditure to satisfy those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Professor Arndt pointed out, the general thing about <span class="highlight">protest</span> movements of this kind is that the questions at issue are seen as matters of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, I seek leave of the House to move motions relating to Sessional Orders for the routine of business of the House, the power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to a select committee report, the counting of members in a quorum, the Speaker’s discretion relating to the adjournment of the House when a quorum is not present, and the ringing of division bells in successive divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those relating to the routine of business, the power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to a select committee report, the counting of members in a quorum and the Speaker’s discretion as to adjourning the House, and the time forringing division bells on successive divisions operated for the remainder of the autumn period of sittings and ceased to have effect when the House rose for the winter adjournment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems more that they are using a convenient symbol to <span class="highlight">protest</span> their concern at the treatment which has affected them as rich countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also comment on the lone <span class="highlight">protest</span> made by the genial giant of the Parliament, the honourable member for Wills who, I think, has done the cause of land rights a disservice by castigating the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in such strong terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that by registering this <span class="highlight">protest</span> the honourable member has ignored the fact that the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory in its report, after a proper investigation, has constructively criticised the complementary legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By making this <span class="highlight">protest</span>, he has run the risk of creating greater friction between the Assembly and the Aboriginal people at a time when the Assembly has made genuine attempts to improve its complementary land rights legislation in favour of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this <span class="highlight">protest</span> helps to diminish the confidence of the Aboriginal people in their legislature, the long term effects may be very serious indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, it should be noted that the honourable member’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> is outside the Committee’s terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Third or Fourth Division officers employed by the Department of Social Security, when the new scheme is introduced whereby unemployment benefits are to be paid fortnightly in arrears instead of fortnightly in advance, find that they are so inundated with work that they cannot carry out their duties and then try to make some <span class="highlight">protest</span> against doing unreasonable amounts of overtime, they can be dealt with by this legislation in exactly the same way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was understood that although these officers who originally belonged to the old Postmaster-General’s Department were now officers of two Commissions it was only right and proper that they should have the right to transfer from one commission to the other, even under <span class="highlight">protest</span>, if they so desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say firmly and categorically that this Government has no intention of taking the course that was pursued by the Australian Labor Party when it was in power in 1973 and 1974, when it allowed Australia finally to be excluded in a major part from markets in Europe and at the same time, without <span class="highlight">protest</span>, accepted the cessation of markets in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The campaign culminated last weekend with a <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally and march through the streets of Perth and with the release of a record produced and performed by a local Perth group in which the lyrics protested about the closure of the railway line and criticised the State Government for its decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time senior people in the ABC management ordered its film crew not to cover the <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally which was held in Perth on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally was no small event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been heralded as one of the largest <span class="highlight">protest</span> rallies held in Perth in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, these two actions, that is the banning of the record and the decision not to cover the <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally, have come at the end of a long line of similar instances which I believe reveal a definite pro-Liberal bias on the part of the management of the ABC in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The banning of the record and the decision not to cover the <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally are the two most recent instances of this bias. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State committee of the Australian Journalists Association has taken up this matter and has decided to request from the head of the newsroom in the ABC the reasons for its decision not to cover the <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally last Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the honourable member has the hypocrisy to come into this House and <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the rate of increase in workers’ taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Monday, the Leader of the Opposition and  Mr Hawke  and  Mr Wran,  the three bright lights, the three big stars, the drawcards of the Labor Party, addressed what was to be a massive Budget <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Saturday week 4,000 people assembled in the main street of Kurri to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the proposed closure of this hospital as a result of the Federal Government’s slashing of health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has either government responded or made any <span class="highlight">protest</span> in respect of that advice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rose tonight to <span class="highlight">protest</span> not about whether funds are made available but about the denial of the right to make application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Treasurer aware of a call by a prominent political official in Victoria asking local government councils to support a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Government’s federalism policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Treasurer seen a report in the  Knox Sherbrooke News,  a prominent newspaper in the electorate of La Trobe, which states that the City of Knox has resolved to support the <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s commitment to provide 2 per cent of personal income tax revenues to local government and in view of the dramatic increases in untied revenue grants to the city of Knox under the Fraser Government and the level of funding provided to the States under the federalism policy, does the Treasurer consider that this <span class="highlight">protest</span> is warranted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention has been drawn to a call by the  president  of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party for a <span class="highlight">protest</span> by local government councils throughout Australia against the federalism policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was no method by which there could be a review of action taken by it or by which any <span class="highlight">protest</span> made - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the security Bill then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have specialist staff members voted unanimously to <span class="highlight">protest</span> strongly against restrictive policies which place the lives of their patients at risk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite clearly- and this is a chance to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about this procedure- that that is not the way in which to reform this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could affect church groups, civil rights groups, <span class="highlight">protest</span> groups, minority political groups and, in fact, any opposition party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view would be, and I believe many members of the Liberal Party would support my view, that the action of any citizen in marching in order to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a law that prohibits marching is not the sort of act which ought to attract the operation of this section, and it should not attract the attention of the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the viewand I believe many small ‘1’ liberals would agree with me- that the act of marching by a citizen who wants to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a State government which says that he cannot march without a permit, is not the kind of political or social action which ought to attract the operation or the attention of security forces in order to prescribe that citizen as being involved in a possible act of subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As it was necessary yesterday to make a <span class="highlight">protest</span> about our non-involvement in the evolution of these schemes, I take this opportunity today to congratulate those back bench members of the Government who were responsible for the evolution of this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are worried in relation to the problems of picketing, of people exercising their right of <span class="highlight">protest</span>- for example, outside an office where people were being conscripted during the Vietnam War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it says that a march or demonstration in the street to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a law or executive act of government could be the subject of surveillance under clause 5 (1) (b). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should such a situation occur where those people who have genuine objections to the mining and export of uranium seek to take action to demonstrate that proposition- and the Prime Minister uses his national security powers, as I am sure he would if he thought it was politically advantageous to bring the Army in on a pretext of national security- and picket, demonstrate or in any other way <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the loading, shipping or movement of that uranium, they will find themselves in breach of the terms of this clause and be deemed to be carrying out acts of subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result of the elections in South Australia recently was a direct <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the people of that State against the stand taken by the former Labor Government there in refusing to allow development of three major mining contracts in that State which would have created 7,000 extra jobs within the State of South Australia and would have brought in $4,500m within 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise in the adournment debate this evening to raise two matters and to make some <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the way in which Government members- in particular, Ministers- attack unions in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No government in the history of this country has had as many resignations, as many dismissals and as many Ministers leaving in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way the affairs of the Government are conducted or at the behaviour of Ministers, as has the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977 Attorney-General Ellicott resigned as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> over a matter of principle about the way in which the Prime Minister was conducting the affairs not just of the Government but of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we know that the current Leader of the Australian Democrats is Leader of the Democrats and there is an effective, viable minority party in the form of a democratic party, because of the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the way that the former Minister,  Senator Chipp,  left the Government coalition parties as a <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently the employees, after discussion on the company’s intention regarding a Federal award, walked off the job for a day in <span class="highlight">protest</span> and decided to stop work on every day of the hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following ACOA’s direction that staff ‘be “absent from work” on Tuesday, 29 May 1979, to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against retrenchment legislation before Parliament’, the Public Service Board, on 28 May 1979, informed all departments and authorities of action which in the Board’s view should be taken in relation to absences, viz. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the original arrest of Carmichael and others, and in the wake of the subsequent widescale public <span class="highlight">protest</span>, police said they would not make any more arrests on the spot but would issue summonses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months we have witnessed also the unusual occurrence of groups such as farmers taking industrial action by withdrawing their stock from the market in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the Government’s trebling of the stock levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as this question is concerned, it was about eight or nine days after the occurrence of the event I was just describing that all members of Kim Young-San ‘s party, the NDP, submitted their resignations in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not be raising any <span class="highlight">protest</span> because it is of the opinion that there has been some slip in the preparation of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland there is not a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span>, very often not even a line in a newspaper, because the decision is seen for what it is- a decision of an independent tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Past trends and statements by those still involved with political dissent indicate that <span class="highlight">protest</span> will go on, although there could be a lull while a new community of dissent evolves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, some have presented letters of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and petitions to USSR Embassy officials expressing views on the lack of human rights being granted to individuals in their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is important for all of us to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the growing inflexibility of this bureaucratic procedure and the way in which planning resources are determined for universities and colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a tremendous concession by a National Country Party Minister which could only be allowed without <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the industry due to the working of the previous plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently this storm of <span class="highlight">protest</span> has forced the Cabinet to agree to an interdepartmental review of the duty, which commenced late in July, shortly after the measure commenced operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-At the outset, I register my strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the indecent way in which this very important motion is being rushed through the House and the indecent manner in which the report of the Committee - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
