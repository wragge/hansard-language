    <p>Why has the Government allowed the nursing profession to deteriorate to the point where nurses have to come out and <span class="highlight">protest</span> against their poor pay and substandard conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the after effects of 2 separate nuclear testings by the French Government in the Pacific, resulting in the massive tragedy of earthquakes in South America, will the Australian Government launch a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the United Nations Security Council against further testing of nuclear weapons and press for the initiation of an inquiry in depth into the relationship between nuclear testing and earthquakes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Rockdale Municipal Council intends lodging a strongly worded <span class="highlight">protest</span> to him concerning what the Council asserts is a grossly discourteous action on the part of the Department in providing information on noise exposure forecasts exclusively to the State Planning Authority of New South Wales before the Noise Abatement Committee has had a chance to discuss the material and is threatening to withdraw its representation on the committee unless councils are treated as equal partners entitled to the information as much as the State Planning Authority is? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly if a <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been made it will have gone to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any <span class="highlight">protest</span> that the law should not apply to waterside workers falls in vain upon me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister express himself very strongly in favour of open Government; if so, why has the Prime Minister not released to the Parliament and the public the contents of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> he made to the  President  of the United States of America in connection with the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, North Vietnam, by the United States’ Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment  Mr Whitlam  got to know of this, he lodged the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Minister assisting the Minister for Defence: In view of the discrepancies concerning the number of naval persons not wishing to sail on HMAS Sydney’ if it is to take part in the <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French nuclear tests, will the Minister put down a statement listing the numbers and the designations of those involved and the reasons for their not participating in the operation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the criticism that was inflicted on the Government by the Opposition, especially since the delaying tactics of the Opposition caused the excessive delay in the presentation of the Address-in-Reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if there are instances of human rights which are jeopardised and threatened in that country, I believe that just because we happen to be growing in closer relationship, government to government, we should not be sufficiently tamed not to raise our voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and to seek a change or an amelioration of the lot of people in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he intends to say, I do not know, but I should think, as the Minister responsible for Aboriginal settlements, that if there is anything in  Senator Keeffe  ‘s <span class="highlight">protest</span> which perhaps affects my Department, I should reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object strongly and I place on record my <span class="highlight">protest</span> that, when an arrangement is made between a Government Minister and the Opposition leader who is in charge of the chamber that arrangement should be adhered to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Australian <span class="highlight">protest</span> symbolic of the Government’s policy of switching sides to the Communist bloc in the new realignment ofworld power now taking place in Southern Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will he ask also why the new fees were not promulgated until June- last month- thus preventing an earlier <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of all the doctors who have been disadvantaged by this unfair administrative action since 1 January this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only make this <span class="highlight">protest</span> and say that, whilst I am not indicating that there will be any vote against this motion, if the ordinary proprieties of the Senate are to be oberved there ought to be communication between the parties on occasions such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this by way of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government made any <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics against the imprisonment of Moroz; if not, when does it propose to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-82-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise only to register my <span class="highlight">protest</span>, which I expressed at some length earlier this evening, as to the way in which this debate has been conducted by the Government Party and by the members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just register my <span class="highlight">protest</span> because . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We register our <span class="highlight">protest</span> against what we regard as an iniquitous policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the third time, I ask: Will he elaborate to the people of Australia whether these things occurred and, if they occurred, whether a <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made to the Russian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made, why not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is an indication of the dismay which is sweeping through the Government ranks that when I make remarks such as that, which in earlier days might have brought forward a host of interjections, there is a stolid, solid, sorry lot of honourable senators unable to rouse themselves even to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-No, there is no truth whatsoever in any suggestion about a <span class="highlight">protest</span> from North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not evident that such an act against humanity is now being perpetrated and that the Australian people and the Government should at least <span class="highlight">protest</span> in an endeavour to save lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Whilst I realise that senior Ministers cannot be expected to attend every march of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which may be conducted throughout Australia, will the Government give an assurance that consideration will be given to having a Federal Minister available to hear the case for greater assistance for primary industry which will be put forward by those attending? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some unfortunate remarks were made in this chamber not long ago which can be considered in the light of what  Senator Greenwood  said and what others said by interjection to  Senator Greenwood  about association and motivation behind the call coming from the Communist Party and its influence in the <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some days ago when  Senator Sim  was speaking in this chamber he referred to one of the journals of the Communist Party which dealt with the role of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement and he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has it the basic tenets of a legitimate <span class="highlight">protest</span>, such as the one that has been mentioned by a number of interjectors opposite - the farmers’ march, for instance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A silent <span class="highlight">protest</span> at lunch hour in Australia Square on Friday, May 8th, from 12-2 (first day of the school holidays). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a normal democratic right which I hope we will be able to hold forever, that is, to issue our <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least, the people within the United States, the leadership within the United States and the people within Congress, when they know that their colleagues within Congress are actively participating in a great mass movement like this, are prepared to accept the right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> as a democratic right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that the farmers at Edenhope originated the farmers’ <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result was the holding of <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings at which the farmers objected because the Government was not taking any action to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his letter of 18th December to  Mr Chamberlain  in Western Australia,  Mr Whitlam  said that members of the Party should not give the false and damaging impression that under a Labor government foreign policy would be determined at mass meetings or by public <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Melbourne ‘Age’ of 30th March 1970 - and the ‘Age’ has been prepared to give credence to the more responsible attitudes of the Australian Labor Party - under the heading of ‘Dangerous <span class="highlight">protest</span>’ said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is happening is that members of the Labor Party are being hauled along and are trailing behind organisers and other groups which are hell bent on making some <span class="highlight">protest</span> on 8th May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people en masse have now decided to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and  Senator Greenwood,  the hawk from Victoria, is endeavouring to incite violence so that he can come back to this Parliament and say: ‘We were right.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  ask the Leader ofthe Government in the Senate: In view of statements of Government supporters who say they believe in the people’s right to dissent and <span class="highlight">protest</span> in our democracy, but who claim to he very concerned at the possibility of violence on the day of the forthcoming Vietnam Moratorium pro- test, will the Leader of the Government in the Senate request State governments to close off for 30 minutes traffic from certain streets in capital cities where these protests are to he held, as is frequently done for marches and like events, and thereby show that the Government is sincere in its endeavour to see peaceful <span class="highlight">protest</span> demonstrations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that Australia is a live and vital country with a tremendous economy, and it is completely unreal to suggest that because some people want to exercise their right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> - within the law if you like - that right should take precedence of the management and conduct of the affairs of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government protested ro General Lon Nol of Cambodia concerning the massacre of Vietnamese? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>does the Government intend to lodge such a <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us consider the Moratorium on 8th May to be a legitimate method of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is not claimed that the opinions of Australian electors should be influenced and promoted by the example of dissent and <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and possibly by demonstrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercising of what is popularly called the right of <span class="highlight">protest</span> or the right to dissent is something which is valued and which our society should be concerned to preserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Moratorium Campaign is not an expression of legitimate <span class="highlight">protest</span> and dissent within the law: it is activity outside the law which is being propagated in association  with  a  doctrine  that citizens have the right - and in some cases it is expressed as a duty - to disobey not merely unjust laws but objectionable laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is because of matters such as these that the Australian people intend to <span class="highlight">protest</span> as part of the Moratorium movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this <span class="highlight">protest</span> has to take place because it is only by the people going out into the streets and showing how they feel that changes can be brought about in the policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian people will take the same kind of action to see that the Government and the rest of the people- know that they are just as opposed to what is a brutal and unjust war as are the people of the United Stales and the people of other countries who have made similar protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should look at the structure of the modern day <span class="highlight">protest</span> that tries to create an appearance of being spontaneous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Motivating this sort of <span class="highlight">protest</span> is a new theory, or perhaps it is not altogether a new theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the whole motivation behind the Moratorium <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement, lt is a move towards anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the circumstances of the case which were apparently shown on television, I would think that that would be a matter in which New South Wales policemen were involved and if anybody has any <span class="highlight">protest</span> to make about the way in which they handled the situation the representations should be made to the New South Wales Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who are now trying very carefully to divert this argument to one about the national liberation forces &lt;bd the nag were the people who, during the debates in the Senate last week, accepted the principle that there was a right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Government’s policies on matters of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the sooner the Government answers this world-wide move, this great upsurge of dissent and <span class="highlight">protest</span> that is increasing throughout the world, and realises before it is too late that it has been following the wrong path a destructive one from a psychological point of view the better it will be for mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that notwithstanding that it was a denial by the view of the rights of a majority, notwithstanding that it was a usurpation of the streets by a few determined to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, irrespective of the inconvenience which they caused to other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been impressed by the large amount of evidence that has been placed before me that this Bill, if implemented as it stands, may have very serious effects upon a very important section of the medical profession, that is, the general practitioners who, I am informed, constitute 40% of the medical profession in this country and who, if I am to judge from the number of them who have got in touch with me individually and in a representative capacity to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Bill, regard its provisions as seriously threatening their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the final analysis what has happened is that, after a very strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> on the last occasion this matter came before the Senate, quite a number of people on the Government side joined with us on the Opposition side to point out the anomaly existing between the allowances of a member of the House of Representatives in a city electorate and of a senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The electors have no way by which, at the ballot box, they can register a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the proposition, which is most serious, which has far reaching consequences for the whole of the Commonwealth and to which, apparently, a great deal of permanence attaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is reported that Edenhope farmers may organise a mass march on Canberra to  <span class="highlight">protest</span> over  the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here we have farmers in the most fertile areas of this country forced to come together to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the conditions that they have to face and to call for remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the serious economic harm that could come to Australia from the threatened national strike next week and because of the widespread difficulties and loss of wages it would cause, will the Leader of the Government in the Senate suggest to the Prime Minister that the Australian Broadcasting Commission and commercial radio and television operators be asked to make time available to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  and the Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party,  Senator Gair,  to make an appeal to all employees to resist the call for strike action, which is intended to be a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Commonwealth Budget, as such action would not only harm Australians generally but would also delay the economic good effects that most reliable commentators expect to flow from the Commonwealth Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Was the demonstration just concluded in Adelaide today in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Federal Budget the most successful <span class="highlight">protest</span> held in any capital city in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that because of the increasing expenditure abroad by commercial television stations on the purchase of overseas programmes Australian screen writers, artists, producers and technicians are becoming increasingly concerned at the lack of job opportunities available to them and that very large and well attended meetings have been held in Sydney and Melbourne over the past 10 days to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this very serious development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In opposing the Budget the Opposition has taken the unprecedented step of taking industrial action as a political <span class="highlight">protest</span>.. Honourable senators opposite have called it a ‘rally’, but really it was a strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite much publicity the Budget <span class="highlight">protest</span> cum strike - call it what you like - as a demonstration was a damp squib and fell far short of the promoters expectations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly, but it was a good form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the ACTU organised a <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the reduction in workers’ standards brought about by this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today  Senator Cavanagh  referred first to the strike that was called by  Mr Hawke  last Tuesday and then he moderated his tone by referring to it as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So  Mr Hawke  gradually had to moderate and come down to saying that there would be a <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strike is an entirely different thing from a <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the Opposition may say regarding  Mr Hawke’s  call for a strike or <span class="highlight">protest</span> recently, he did not receive good support from the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The small numbers who went out in <span class="highlight">protest</span> showed clearly that people were not prepared to accept this blatant attempt by the leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to oppose parliamentary democracy, and this was basically what  Mr Hawke  was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was calling for strikes and then for protests on the very day on which the Leader of the Opposition was to reply to the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if I am wrong in that statement I defy anybody to give me figures showing a comparison of the cost of man-hours lost in industry during the <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this Budget held last week with the cost to the rural industries of increased shipping freights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In their contributions in support of the Budget most honourable senators on the Government side have criticised the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions claiming that he organised employees and initially called a strike last week in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Mr Hawke  is only one member of the executive of the ACTU which unanimously carried a resolution for, not a strike, but a <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today and at other times we have heard honourable senators on the Government side criticising and condemning  Mr Hawke  as though he was the one who had called the <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What- ever one may say about demonstrations - my friend  Senator Webster  interjected tonight when  Senator Cameron  was speaking about the demonstration organised by the Australian Council of Trade Unions in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Budget - there is no doubt that people are entitled to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him: Does he think that the Government is enhancing Australia’s prestige by stopping one person from coming here, irrespective of whether this person wants to speak at a meeting which is being held to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the declared policy of the Government and which has the support, one may say from the votes cast in the last general election, of practically half the population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Farmers, supporters of the Party that you,  Mr Deputy President,  represent in this Parliament, have held <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have marched in Melbourne and Adelaide in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, as you would know,  Mr Deputy President,  they have held <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings in the main regional centres and towns of the States that we represent in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Party does not adopt the suggestion put by some people that we should <span class="highlight">protest</span> merely because there may not have been an increase or a desirable increase in the defence vote each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when this man comes out in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a Budget of which he disapproves and says, in effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt is time the people of Australia were made fully aware of and rose in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the reputation this Government is creating for Australia all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine the Minister is referring to those people who are organising the Moratorium Campaign in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against Australia’s involvement in Vietnam -  who seek not peace but peaceful submission, to those who seek to promote the rule of the streets and the power of the mob with the subsequent threat that that involves to the maintenance of law and order in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, on every occasion on which  Dr Cairns  has spoken in support of a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the war in Vietnam he has counselled peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is borne out by the gallup polls that have been conducted and by the demonstrations that people have held in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against our involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is truly incomprehensible that the forwarding companies have been able to increase their total charges by 474 per cent over 11 years without a voice raised seriously in <span class="highlight">protest</span> whereas ANL, after reducing its freights by about 50 per cent over the same period, is being pilloried for increasing its freights by 12i per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas the workers have the ability to wirthdraw their services and to demand some justice, the farmers are not in that situation although, by a very substantial <span class="highlight">protest</span> march through the streets of Melbourne, they did endeavour to put their case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Australia should never forget that when John Curtin defeated the Fadden Government in 1941 and came into power he was concerned not only with the war effort but also with the unequal distribution of the national wealth, which caused him on 1st October 1941, in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the methods provided in the Budget for the raising of revenue, to move that the first item in the Estimates be reduced by 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 suggest that if one extends in graph form the total annual payments of age and invalid pensions during the 1960s- that is, from 1960 until 1970- one will see that the year of the greatest noise in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the meanness of the Government happens to coincide on the graph with the year of the highest increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when the industry has reached such a critical state, when the price of wool is lower than it has been at any time in the last 25 years, when costs and prices are at a record level, when the employment situation in rural areas is in a severe position and after a series of <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings have been held throughout many rural areas in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, after the farmers have marched in Adelaide and in Melbourne, and in the dying hours of this session of the Parliament and, perhaps more importantly from the Government’s point of view just prior to a Senate election being held, the Government has decided to introduce legislation to establish the Australian Wool Commission, which will consist of a chairman, 2 members representing the wool growers, 1 member representing the Commonwealth Government and 3 other members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It, as the Minister stated, recent amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act have removed reasons for opposition to the Act and for refusal to pay penalties, does his reply suggest that there could have been a legitimate reason for <span class="highlight">protest</span> before the Act was amended and that therefore no attempt will be made to collect the fines, in excess of $30,000, owing for penalties under the legislation before it was amended? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear from the answers given by the Minister today that it is determined purely on a racial basis.In my view it is entirely immoral in every respect and 1 want to voice my <span class="highlight">protest</span> not only in relation to the specific case 1 have mentioned but also in relation to all persons who find themselves in a similar position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said last night-4 will not walk away from anything I have said - I do not think that anybody has a right to be a nuisance or to deface property, but the reason why there are protesters today is the legislation that the Government is a party to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe, in the first place, that the reason why the youth of this country are disillusioned and are protesting lies in our political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of these young people do not want to go into the streets and <span class="highlight">protest</span> but they have been forced to do so because they are discontented with and frustrated by the fact that such a state of affairs exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every time people start to express dissent in numbers, every time thousands of citizens want to go through the streets to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, that is an action which starts to shake the executive government in its control of affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there are laws to allow the people to exercise their right of <span class="highlight">protest</span> the executive government will use every means available to it to see that they do not <span class="highlight">protest</span>, that they do not express dissent and that they do not assemble peaceably or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Along with other returned soldiers, some Catholics, some Protestants and others with no religion, I was invited to march in the procession, and we decided, whether or not the city council granted permission, that we would march in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a vicious secretarian local government by-law which would have victimised a large number of people and forever destroyed the St Patrick’s Day procession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, I suggest that after the words ‘having regard to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and nature’, words something like these could be inserted: ‘and including a proper consideration of the right and enjoyment of persons to peaceful assembly and peaceful <span class="highlight">protest</span>, the public communication of ideas and social comment, and a proper balancing of the interests they represent.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this definition provision is intended to extend further and further and to cramp and restrict people more and more so that the citizen who wants to <span class="highlight">protest</span> has to try to find some way in the interstices of the maze of law which has been created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why the Minister refuses to accept the proposition that if we are going to have this definition there ought to be a balance in the Bill which would provide that a person can lawfully do certain things, that he can <span class="highlight">protest</span>, that he can dissent and so on, if his behaviour taken as a whole is not unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only natural that those people who want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the actions of a country will go to its embassy or consulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to my own observations of protests these protesters generally do not do anything personal against the representatives; it is against their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why demonstrators go to these official residences is that it is the address of the country against which they wish to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When guards were placed at the foreign embassies there was some <span class="highlight">protest</span> by policemen who said that they were parading continuously outside the embassies for the whole of their tour of duty and that the conditions of service were not satisfactory in view of the rewards they were getting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1963 the Gove dispute, that is, the <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the action of the Federal Government in excising a large part of the reserve for mining, and the subsequent investigation and report of the Select Committee, made it clear that the people have an hereditary right to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls it wrong that trade unions should join with the other groups in the community, the churches - not all the churches but a number of them - to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against something which is against their social conscience and which is important enough for them to say to their members: ‘We ask you to stop work, to lose wages and to show how much you disapprove of this evil war, this genocide being committed against the Vietnamese people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Robert Gordon Menzies, resigned; I quote the Sydney Moring Hearld as a most emphatic means of registering his <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been done with a purpose - to demonstrate, and <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Government in a small way, that members of the Opposition are concerned and disappointed at the Government’s failure to come to grips with the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The punch line came when  Senator Brown  told us the interesting fact that the then Attorney-General,  Mr Menzies,  before whom all the Liberals genuflect, resigned, to quote the words of the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’, ‘as a most emphatic means of registering his <span class="highlight">protest</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sincerity of  Senator Willesee’s  protestations can be judged by the statement in the Canberra Times’ of today’s date that the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  wrote to the Prime Minister on Monday suggesting that an independent commission should inquire into parliamentary salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that it is a legitimate inference from the conduct of this Government in relation to Vietnam that it always had in mind to send more troops to Vietnam than it in fact sent and the only thing that prevented it from deploying an even greater force in Vietnam was the great <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement which built up in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Federal Executive of the Australian Journalists Association would have been aware of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the Victorian body, and I think it ought to have been aware that there was not much prospect of success for an appeal by me to that body for redress against the ‘Age’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They believe - I fully accept that this is their opinion - that once a regulation is promulgated and comes into operation that is the end of the matter and any <span class="highlight">protest</span> they make will be futile and completely unproductive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that those of us on this side of the chamber who feel strongly about the matter should willingly, and without some <span class="highlight">protest</span>, accept a position that in our defence forces people may engage in treason and that they may engage in traitorous conduct in the face of the enemy and, in those circumstances, imperil the lives or worse of their colleagues, and do so knowing that they do not face the death penalty in the face of the enemy but that they will suffer life imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I refer to the emotional issues which involve justice to Aborigines and the right of Aborigines to <span class="highlight">protest</span> effectively by using the area in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this issue, let me just say that on Australia Day, 26th January, the Aborigines erected a number of tents on the lawns in front of Parliament House for the purpose of protesting against deprivation of Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They established an embassy in that area in order to make known that <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say that the tents were erected on behalf of the Aborigines who were protesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that tents were erected for the purposes of demonstration and <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been accepted that Australians observe the right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against some injustice done to a section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal embassy provided a means by which Aborigines could ventilate their <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Aboriginal embassy is erected again, or if there is any similar <span class="highlight">protest</span> on the lawns in front of Parliament House, any politician who goes across the road to support the protesters - and politicians have thought that it is their duty to do so - will be in breach of this Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a copy of that telegram which was sent on 26th January 1972, the day on which the <span class="highlight">protest</span> group of Aborigines set up their embassy outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land rights was one of the reasons why the Aboriginal people set up their embassy to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is possible to look briefly only at each of the problems about which the Aboriginal people protested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area of <span class="highlight">protest</span> concerns the health of Aborigines throughout Australia, particularly the health of Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government repaid them by bringing in 200 police at a time to chase them off the lawns in front of Parliament House and to stop their public <span class="highlight">protest</span> because it was embarrassing to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it seemed to be an act of <span class="highlight">protest</span> on the part of a few people who could have been allowed to remain there until such time as they had tired of the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No-one made a formal <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want  Senator Bonner  to state clearly to me just how and when I have been associated actively with the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not been associated directly with this particular <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not at any time take part in any activity or <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Aborigines here in Canberra or in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken an active part in other protests and demonstrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I have taken part in protests and demonstrations in support of racial tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> by a Minister sitting on the front bench - I think it was  Senator Cotton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be disallowed if only to enable the group of Aborigines who sought to <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the way that they did to reerect their tents in front of this place so that there may be a constant reminder to us that something needs to be done in greater depth and that we need a better understanding than  Senator Little  brought to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must <span class="highlight">protest</span> against your acceptance these people and emphasise that groups who have demonstrated Brisbane and recently Canberra claiming to represent Queensland Torres Strait Islands do nol in fact represent Queensland Torres Strait Islands who have their own elected group as advisory council of which I am chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore to those who have suggested that in this form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> they should be accorded a solicitude and a tolerance which is denied to other sections of the community who similarly want to <span class="highlight">protest</span> on issues which are relevant to their interests in life, I say that once they do that they are putting the Aborigines in a position different from that of the rest of the community; they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on racial integration, they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on toleration and the whole of their thesis on the ultimate integration of the Aboriginal people with the white culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I say in these last few minutes that those who have supported the Aborigines in this programme and in this type of <span class="highlight">protest</span> should have second thoughts about it, to see if by doing that they have not in fact done a great deal of harm to the campaign of these people and to the campaign of the Australian community for the ultimate total absorption of our indigenous people in our culture without any distinctions or differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said that members of the Labor Party who took an active interest in this debate were of the opinion that the Aborigines had a just cause and that they had protested more vehemently for that cause than they would have for other causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the cause cannot be mentioned in that way - by suggesting that the Labor Party should <span class="highlight">protest</span> if the Nazi Party or a Croatian party wanted to demonstrate on the lawns in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that there would have been a statement by the Government on its intention to make adequate provision for people to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, other than the half hour demonstrations that are held from time to time, without it being necessary to do what the Aborigines did on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alarming state of affairs is portrayed by an article in today’s ‘Australian’ headed ‘Defiant students on march’, together with a photograph showing a heap of ties, belts and gloves being burnt by students said to be as a <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very inconsistent with the protests against violence that we have heard in the Senate in recent days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole history of pensions in Australia has been one of chronic dissatisfaction, of periodic adjustments and always frustration, disappointment and <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was sufficient to raise a <span class="highlight">protest</span> from visitors who were there that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noticed what has been reported in the Press as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the Yugoslav Government to the United States Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the description of it by  Senator Mulvihill  is a <span class="highlight">protest</span> about inflammatory editorials in newspapers, I think we must recognise that in this country, providing the incitement involved in the newspapers does not offend against the law, there is an essential freedom of speech which we know does not exist in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been drafted a reply to the <span class="highlight">protest</span> note from the Yugoslav Government concerning antiYugoslav terrorist activities in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period when Parliament was not sitting there was a Press report, completely without foundation, that I was supposed to have delayed the sending of a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time that Press report appeared I had not even seen the <span class="highlight">protest</span> note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the matter no further than voicing my <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 couple that appeal with an appeal for action on behalf of the Polish national who has experienced this undue delay in the settlement of his claim and about whom, for some reason, the Government feels it is infra dig to make any strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the West German Goverment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the interest and concern of our Pacific Islands neighbours about the Australian Government’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> to France about its intention of testing further nuclear devices in the Pacific next year, I ask: Has the Government considered the imposition of economic sanctions to prevent these nuclear tests from going ahead, such as warning that it will scrap its plans to purchase Mirage F1 fighters from France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government will not consider some action as a form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>, how can the Australian public and Australia’s neighbours be expected to believe that the Government is trying to persuade the French to stop the tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This made it abundantly clear that Australia had used the normal procedures to register its <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the current protests against the French nuclear tests, is the Minister aware that the Chinese share with the French a policy of persisting with nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no evidence of health dangers, what are the grounds for <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will any protests directed against nuclear testing be directed to both nations using nuclear test explosions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any truth in the report will he take suitable action to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to those who were responsible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I register my strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> at your treatment of representations made by me on behalf of countless Australians who are deeply concerned at your Government’s policy of permissiveness particularly in regard to censorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I ask: Is the Government reluctant to impose worthwhile sanctions on French Government as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the declared intention of that Government to conduct further nuclear testing in the Pacific region, because of the fear of French reaction which the Israeli Government experienced in 1967? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of the Senate, can the Attorney-General summarise the contents of the note given to the Yugoslav Government in reply to its <span class="highlight">protest</span> about Australian authorities doing nothing to prevent Yugoslav terrorists training in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A long time ago the Gurindjis went on strike and established a settlement in the Wattie Creek area as their form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against industrial conditions, health conditions, and the refusal of this Government to recognise the value of their case for land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When members of the Opposition <span class="highlight">protest</span> about this and when people talk about it,  Senator Little  says that we are making political capital out of it because we want to do something for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the statement today by the responsible New Zealand Minister concerning a further <span class="highlight">protest</span> by New Zealand, 1 ask: Are any new moves proposed by Australia, New Zealand or other Pacific countries to initiate efforts to prevent such tests going on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a reply been drafted to a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note received from the Yugoslav Government concerning anti- Yugoslav terrorist activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government reluctant to impose effectiveness sanctions against the French Government as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against that Government’s declared intention to conduct further nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean region because of the fear of an adverse French reaction, similar to that experienced by the Government of Israel in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to take the time of the Senate by prolonging this debate but I also want to raise my <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a move that could have led to the destruction of the 2-airline policy but there was no ripple of <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made the point also that at the time of the proposed takeover by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd there was not a ripple of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General table in the Senate a summary of the Government’s note in reply to the Government of Yugoslavia’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> that nothing had been done to prevent Yugoslav terrorists from training in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Government assented to send a naval vessel into the French Pacific nuclear testing zone in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If protests are in train, having regard to the Government’s dedicated commitment to open government, can the Minister explain why it was necessary to send a scientific observer in secret to Tahiti to await and observe such nuclear tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oan the Minister explain why no similar protests are being mounted by this Government against the Red Chinese nuclear tests at Lop Nor - marginally closer to Australia - which tests, having regard to prevailing wind currents, are far more likely to pollute the Australian atmosphere than the French tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this failure to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against China just another example of the  snivellingly  obsequious nature of the Whitlam Government’s so-called independent foreign policy- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  referred to the failure of the then Opposition to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about Chinese nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, during a debate on the motion to adjourn the Senate, the then Minister had the grace to recite into the Senate record the various protests which had been made by myself,  Mr Whitlam,  then the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and I think by some others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He conceded - perhaps these are my words and not his - that he was quite wrong and that the most definite and heavy protests had been made by members of the Austraiian Labor Party against the nuclear tests in China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only voices raised in <span class="highlight">protest</span> have been those of the Torres Strait islanders, the Premier of Queensland,  Mr J.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was not one word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the People’s Republic of China about the condition in which he came out of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder how many protesters would have been marching up and down the streets of their capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can just imagine the noise of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which would resound throughout Australia about the discrimination and the lack of justice in such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer is yes, I ask why the Prime Minister has not released to the Parliament and the public the contents of his <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the  President  of the United States of America in connection with the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by the United States Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he now release the contents of his <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the bombing  of  North Vietnam was delivered  to  the United States, in order to be even-handed why was not an emphatic <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the invasion  of  South Vietnam by, as reported, 200,000 well equipped troops, which in fact triggered  off  the bombing referred  to  and protested against, delivered  to  the Hanoi Government instead  of  advancing a proposal  to  recognise that Government and to receive some of its trade union representatives in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not enter into the argumentative aspects of what was put by the honourable senator in relation to the <span class="highlight">protest</span> by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  question could easily have been put to the other countries and persons around the world who were making similar protests, in various degrees, at the same time as the Australian Government made its <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the United States Government over the bombing of Hanoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On one occasion  Senator Carrick  asked  Senator Wright,  whether the Australian Labor Party ever protested about mainland China entering the nuclear field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright  in his nlmcal manner, blasted the Australian Labor Party for never making a <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Member’s of the honourable senator’s Party and their colleagues in the Country Party put through this Parliament, over our protests for a number of years, a considerable number of measures which allowed entry to premises without such search warrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember the protests that we made against various rural Bills under the provisions of which homes or properties could be entered and searched without any kind of search warrant being produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only after a great deal of <span class="highlight">protest</span> that the former Government desisted from attempts to enact further such measures, but it still did nothing about the fact that there were some half dozen Acts of Parliament which were drawn to its attention and in which there were these departures from what, we would accept, ought to be the ordinary principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> made at this stage is that, despite the disparity in price, it would have been of benefit to the Aborigines in that area if brick houses had been specified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is understood that the Prime Minister formally protested to the Yugoslav Government following the announcement from Yugoslavia of the execution of the 3 Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all relative information was apparently unknown to the Prime Minister at the time of his <span class="highlight">protest</span>, will the Minister detail what further action has been taken by the Prime Minister regarding this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  is right: The Prime Minister made an immediate <span class="highlight">protest</span> and, as everybody knows, he did not have the full information at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Special Minister of State, in his capacity as Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Has any formal reply been received from the Yugoslav Government in response to the <span class="highlight">protest</span> note forwarded on 13th April? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, is this delay far greater than the terms of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> warrant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, we have not had a reply to our <span class="highlight">protest</span> and we have not had an indication of when the reply will come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that in the last few weeks the Australian Government has sent to the Chinese Government its <span class="highlight">protest</span> against China’s nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today he stated that the Australian Labor Government had lodged a <span class="highlight">protest</span> with the Yugoslav Government at the execution of the 3 Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no longer unpopular to <span class="highlight">protest</span> but it will be darned dangerous if we do not <span class="highlight">protest</span> and if nothing is done to stop the tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator asks whether some <span class="highlight">protest</span> should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs may have more precise details with him, .but even in recent weeks a <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made by Australia in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It massacred 146 civilians, but we did not hear a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> from honourable senators opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">protest</span> then from  Dr J.  F. Cairns; np <span class="highlight">protest</span> from  Mr Uren;  no <span class="highlight">protest</span> from  Mr Clyde  Cameron; not even a <span class="highlight">protest</span> from  Mr Whitlam,  the white knight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing has been said or done by the Australian Government since the ceasefire to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, are we not entitled to register a <span class="highlight">protest</span>, having regard to the fact that more than 400 Australian men were killed in action in the Vietnam war and hundreds more were wounded and maimed in the service of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is that Australia did not <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in our <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China and, indeed, to any other country that is exploding nuclear devices in the atmosphere, we can get our point over and have some influence without harming relationships, that is precisely what we will be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that after the question of the executions arose, after we sent our <span class="highlight">protest</span> note and after our Ambassador saw the authorities in Yugoslavia, they told him that they were willing to start giving some information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do what  Senator Greenwood  suggested - to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to Hanoi, to put pressure on Hanoi or whatever term he used - would be moving away from the Government’s present position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how does it sustain that position in the light of, on the one hand, the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the United States Government in January of this year about the United States bombing of North Vietnam and the particularly virulent statements of condemnation made by several Ministers of the Government at that time and, on the other hand, the complete silence of the Prime Minister and those same Ministers at this time in the face of the obvious North Vietnamese aggression in that area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the bombing, a time when we believed that peace should be brought about in the Indo-China states, the Prime Minister did <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the  President  of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  takes the line that because there is still not complete peace in the IndoChina states we should be protesting to somebody about what is happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government yet received a reply to the <span class="highlight">protest</span> delivered by the Australian Prime Minister to the Yugoslav Government on 13 April? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the delay of almost 4 weeks, why was the <span class="highlight">protest</span> not in writing and what is the Government doing or proposing to do about what appears to be a contemptuous reception of the <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when they were executed the <span class="highlight">protest</span> was not to try to find out whether these men were innocent but a <span class="highlight">protest</span> because the Government was irritated at being told late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government made any <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese Government about that country’s nuclear atmospheric testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, was the <span class="highlight">protest</span> a verbal or written <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, we did make a <span class="highlight">protest</span> shortly after we set up an embassy in China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second part of the honourable senator’s question, that is, whether the <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made verbally or in writing - I understand that this matter was raised in the media - the <span class="highlight">protest</span> took the form of a letter from the Foreign Minister to the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr Chi  Peng-fei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, a formal <span class="highlight">protest</span> has since been made about the executions and an assurance has been sought that Australian Government officials will be granted consular access to any other Australian citizens being held in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge the Democratic Labor Party has not made any <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A Royal Australian Navy ship will not be deployed until all other means of <span class="highlight">protest</span> have been exhausted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government propose to lodge any <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this gross violation of political liberty and the inhumane treatment of these people by a fellow member of the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge the Government has not examined whether lodging a <span class="highlight">protest</span> would be the correct thing to do in the prevailing circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sent a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note about this incident, telling them of our dissatisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I voice my <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the manner in which the amendment was moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have received an answer to the <span class="highlight">protest</span> note and we have carried on negotiations since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As both France and China opposed this motion, will the Government send a formal letter of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China and France for not supporting such a resolution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has made its position clear by a special <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the committee have leave to report from time to time and that any member of the committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise the matter also because my colleague,  Senator Marriott,  recently elicited the answer that the fees that are being paid to these gentry who with an entourage of staff are engaging themselves in Melbourne or elsewhere, not having access to the offices in Tasmania, are piling up expenditure that is not relatively insignificant but so stupid that we are bound to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we got the protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they are justified I do not know, but I am not one who accepts the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>basis of the protests has changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that as members of a States House we ought to register our <span class="highlight">protest</span> about these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps can the Government take to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this breach of ethics by France in defiance of the International Court of Justice deliberations and world public opinion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not recall your party making such a <span class="highlight">protest</span> when the Ansett Group decided to enter the Television field, nor when they entered the Hotel/Motel field nor were there wild statements that they may take over the almost defunct Victorian Railways! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has said, with respect to when the notional rate was only 51/2 per cent: ‘I think that ATI had some reason to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about that’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support what my Leader  (Senator Withers)  has said and to register our <span class="highlight">protest</span> at what is being done to curtail the ability of this Senate to discuss matters of great significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when  Senator Murphy  and his colleagues in the Labor Party were in Opposition we knew how they used to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about any limitations in time which might be imposed and how they sought to exercise to the full their opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an ordinance to prohibit them from camping there, but they will still be allowed to stand out there and make their <span class="highlight">protest</span> in a proper and dignified manner like any other Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that the time will come when Aborigines will want to return here and make some <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aborigines will then be able to <span class="highlight">protest</span> with the dignity with which their forefathers roamed this nation before the coming of the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the action taken,  Senator DrakeBrockman  and I have received a great number of telegrams of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that there are other signatories in the Northern Territory and if they were added the total number protesting against what has been done would be some 500 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great deal has been said -  Senator Jessop  spoke of it - of mass meetings which were called in the area involved to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this acquisition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to registering the opposition of members of the Liberal Party to the elimination of concession to mining companies in regard to calls for their shares, I also want to register our <span class="highlight">protest</span>, particularly my own <span class="highlight">protest</span>, at the way in which the Government has introduced these whole series of major policy changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When was the <span class="highlight">protest</span> of the Australian Government made to the Government of the People’s Republic of China concerning that country’s nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> took the form of a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr Chi  Peng-Fei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What were the terms of the Australian <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that whatever verbal <span class="highlight">protest</span> the Government may have made to China it is entirely different from the positive hostile action taken ‘against France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My <span class="highlight">protest</span> is that anybody who today joins with others in destroying one of the safeguards that we have against terrorism and violence, who will not protect a policeman and who will not protect a member of gaol staff is not discharging the appropriate responsibility he has for the maintenance of the structure of today’s community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the national heroes since then has been a young student named Jan Palach who, in 1969, gave up his life as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the tyranny that had been imposed upon his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If our Government were to do that, there would be less of those accusations that our Government is anxious always to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against infringements by non-communist countries but is silent when wrong is done by communist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement is essentially a <span class="highlight">protest</span> that whilst the New Zealand carpet industry has no limitation other than preference tariff duties for its large and increasing export of pile carpet to Australia - currently about 23 per cent of New Zealand production and abou: 91 per cent of New Zealand exports - the Australian carpet industry is almost completely deprived of opportunity to export carpet to New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has protested to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not told us - maybe there are diplomatic reasons for this - the form or the terms of the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  appeared confused as to the form of the <span class="highlight">protest</span>, and I will come to that later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept the fact that the Government - maybe reluctantly; maybe more in sorrow than in anger - has protested to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Prime Minister was asked about the form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> made to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have you had any response from the Chinese Government on your <span class="highlight">protest</span> note on nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China was oral, so there would be no written response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">protest</span> was oral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> took the form of a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr Chi  Peng-Fei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a written <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week before the Prime Minister has said that it was only an oral <span class="highlight">protest</span>, so there would be no response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we had the Foreign Minister, who presumably sent the <span class="highlight">protest</span>, not knowing he had sent it saying it was an oral <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it also indicates that he had very little interest in the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hawke  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions also has boasted that the ACTU has mobilised the trade unions throughout the world to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and to place a ban on French trade and French communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest the answer is that they would not have received the delegation because the Australian Government had protested against French atmospheric nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting to note that despite the ban on French trade there was no <span class="highlight">protest</span> from  Mr Hawke  and the trade unions about the visit of the Chinese Trade Minister and the conclusion of a trade agreement with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we have a selective <span class="highlight">protest</span> and a selective policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made a reported statement in which he said that he was remaining in  Australia  for some weeks to display to the French Australia’s strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French atmospheric nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What logic or rationality can there be for one Ambassador to remain in Australia in <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the other to remain in China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can assume only that the Government has no intention of going beyond making some mild <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this has been done without a word of public <span class="highlight">protest</span> or condemnation from the AttorneyGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only rise to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of newspaper reports of the Prime Minister’s Press conference yesterday in which the Prime Minister stated that he did not propose to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Soviet authorities about their treatment of intellectuals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this information, and in view of the Prime Minister’s reply, will the Minister undertake to discuss with the Prime Minister the possibility of the Prime Minister reconsidering the whole question of whether or not he should <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Soviet authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or the Government might say: ‘What good would such a <span class="highlight">protest</span> do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I answer that attitude with the words of Solzhenitsyn which prove that a real <span class="highlight">protest</span> might- I emphasise the word ‘might’- be successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Government to the very worth while result of the Liberal Government’s <span class="highlight">protest</span> in 1962. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The deep concern of the mining industry in Western Australia at this action was manifest in a mammoth <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting held at Kalgoorlie on 30 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite <span class="highlight">protest</span> that they are interested in seeing the galloping rate of inflation brought to a stop, but the candidate they are supporting for the Parramatta by-election has said that inflation is just a big joke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To come back to the terms of the motion before the Senate, it states that the Senate deplores the fact that the Government has not been prepared to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China in the manner it has protested to France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not only <span class="highlight">protest</span> but also, if necessary, organise nations and group nations together to stop it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite unequivocally that this matter was put on the notice paper by Sentor Sim as a smokescreen for the retention of nuclear armaments throughout the world and not as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the alleged double standards by the Government or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the beginning of the French tests honourable senators on this side of the chamber who were then in Opposition requested that something positive be done in respect of banning the tests, but the Government brought out a little note of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again refer to the fact that in the days of the early French tests the then Government of this country with its feeble voice of <span class="highlight">protest</span> made no real attempt to stop the explosion of nuclear devices within wind range of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not enter any <span class="highlight">protest</span> against China because it was not playing speaks with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party also made no <span class="highlight">protest</span> when shortly afterwards the Monte Bello Islands, which are on the border of our country, were made available to Great Britain for testing atom bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not notice at that time any of the frenzied protests which have been made about the French tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we in Australia should continue to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should not adopt an attitude that we will be infinitely stronger in our <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a middle grade nation than we will be against the major countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have expected that when Australia was so strong in its <span class="highlight">protest</span> to France it would have been similarly strong in its <span class="highlight">protest</span> to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is asking for trouble while it interferes in what are the internal affairs of country after country throughout the world on the ground that it must <span class="highlight">protest</span> against attacks upon human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese was an apologetic squeak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the French was a continuous and sustained roar of wounded rage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did any Government Minister- the Foreign Minister or the Prime Minister- go to China directly for the reason of protesting against the Chinese tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Attorney-General went to Europe to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have, first of all, the degree of the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we have the monolithic approach to the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> was directed against France but not against China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France and ignore China in protesting about nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was prepared to go along with a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against France and China but not just against France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So off the Prime Minister went to Ottawa to try to drum up support for a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against France but not against China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we the Opposition asked: ‘Why do you not <span class="highlight">protest</span> against China’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in this chamber tonight, one of the 2 chambers of the Australian Parliament, have an opportunity to register a <span class="highlight">protest</span> that may ring around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mere fact that they are still both out of prison- they are not actually free men- is due to some degree to protests from the West and is one of the matters which should encourage us to make sure that our <span class="highlight">protest</span> is lodged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the Labor Government decided to make a timid note of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese and then to sustain a roar of <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French- a roar of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which continues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my earlier remarks I reminded the Senate that in fact we have not bothered to follow up very strenuously our <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese and that we had not even sought too many details about their tests, but that we had continued not only to pursue in the World Court the case against the French but also to send a Minister to France to seek out the French Government and to attempt to talk the French Government into dropping its tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is it that Australia’s Ambassador to France, having returned to Australia, was allowed to say that he was going to stay in Australia for some 6 weeks or more to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the French nuclear tests but our Ambassador in Peking was encouraged to stay there and do nothing by way of showing resentment against the Chinese? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘They <span class="highlight">protest</span> when this is not dangerous, when it can be expected that one antagonist will yield and when there is no risk of condemnation from left circles (it’s of course always best to <span class="highlight">protest</span> together with them). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And could I, please, on behalf of the Opposition and in the name of all humanity urge that the Government make a major <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese that they cease atmospheric testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second way in which we can voice our <span class="highlight">protest</span> as to the way in which the Opposition in the other place has been treated is to require the Government in this chamber to take the Bill through all its stages in accordance with the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in reply- I cannot understand the form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which has been taken on this occasion because of the debating mechanisms of the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to register a <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the Government ‘s actions in failing to provide adequate opportunity for the public of Australia to know what is proposed to be done by the Government and to let it hear informed debate about those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wasn’t proposing, and despite your invitation I don’t think it’s likely that I will, to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Soviet Union about these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But <span class="highlight">protest</span> had this impact within the Soviet Union only when it was backed ‘by the united, mighty voice of hundreds of prominent people, by the opinions of a whole continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not to say that we should be selective when serious abrogations of the rights of man are perpetrated in other countries, but I believe that when we do decide to raise our voices and <span class="highlight">protest</span> we should not qualify that <span class="highlight">protest</span> in any way by saying that it happens in other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years there has been one other terribly important feature which justifies our taking action and making this <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Put into the practical terms of how it affects Australians, it is a matter of knowing whether, if one wants to register a <span class="highlight">protest</span>, one protests to the relevant Commonwealth Minister with some responsibilities in the area or goes to the State Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position adopted by my Party is that under <span class="highlight">protest</span> and only as an armistice- not because it is what we believe; we are going to make a continuing fight for educational justice- we will accept what has been proposed and will not oppose any of the amendments, but if an amendment is moved which is based on the use of the word ‘primary’ we will support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister use the occasion of his coming visit to the Soviet Union to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the heads of the Soviet Government against such brutal and mindless oppression of a distinguished writer whose only crime was to publicise the denial of human rights in the Soviet Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility of a sit-in was anticipated but they decided not to seek police protection as it had an upsetting effect upon the staff and because they have always been able to reason with Aborigines who came there in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is the report correct that the Chinese Government has protested about the reporting by Australian journalists based in China concerning the interesting events now developing in China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the report is correct, what form did the <span class="highlight">protest</span> take? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made, has the Australian Government informed the Chinese Government that it defends the right of Australian journalists to report events free from coercion or threats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far I have not heard any <span class="highlight">protest</span> from some of those people- including people who belong to the same church as the Catholic Bishop of Bilbao- who have so rightly been vocal about what happened to Solzhenitsyn protesting about the Catholic Bishop who is being expelled from Spain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that those people who accept the dictatorship in Spain, who accept the genocide in Vietnam, who accept American intervention in Cuba and Dominica, and who are happy about the coups d’etat and the military juntas in Greece and Chile have no right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about civil liberties in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people have signed a petition of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which they have asked me as a senator to present to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for the Media: Is it a fact that individuals and groups are making their voices heard in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the fact that some television programs seem to be spearheading the decline in moral standards which can undermine the very fabric of individual, family and national life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I think that in response to  Senator Durack  ‘s <span class="highlight">protest</span> you should withdraw the remarks to which he has referred and continue your speech in the Address-in-Reply debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sorry that tonight  Senator Greenwood  felt that he should behave like the lady of whom it was said on one occasion: ‘The lady doth <span class="highlight">protest</span> too much’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All he did was <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that this proposition would bring forth loud protests from both sides of the Senate, the House which exists to protect the rights and individuality of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that we are in the South Pacific Forum and we are dealing with that area, and the <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made in relation to that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party protested long before the Party of which the honourable senator is a member when the Chinese first started nuclear testing in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam,  as Leader of the Opposition, protested to China when he visited that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has protested to the Chinese since he has become Prime Minister and we have specifically sent our Ambassador to China to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Chinese again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for this business of why we protested against one country and not against another, the fact is that it was specifically written into the South Pacific Forum communique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is the sort of thing we should <span class="highlight">protest</span> against and prohibit wherever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government is unable to take action against China in the World Court as it can against France, will the Leader of the Government request the Prime Minister to consider instructing the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, to cancel his planned visit to China to open the Peking fair as a form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Leader of the Government regard such a step as an effective form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> at China’s continuing and callous disregard of the welfare of its people and of the people of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Leader of the Government believe the Chinese Government will take more notice of  Dr Cairn’s  plaintive <span class="highlight">protest</span> than it did of the Prime Minister’s? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Australian Government, through the Prime Minister, has already made an emphatic <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the conduct of the nuclear tests by the Government of the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the report that as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against French atmospheric nuclear tests the Prime Minister refused to accept an invitation from the French Ambassador to celebrate France’s national day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the report is correct will the Prime Minister <span class="highlight">protest</span> in a similar way against the Chinese atmospheric nuclear tests by refusing any invitation to attend receptions given by the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China until such time as China discontinues atmospheric nuclear tests, thereby demonstrating the Government’s much vaunted evenhandedness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least he should have put in a <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the electoral officer in regard to what happened in Western Australia or contacted the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Committee have leave to report from time to time and that any member of the Committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we must, as I say, <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the attitude of the Government- the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  in particularin its failure or refusal to provide this Senate, this Parliament and the public with the version of the facts presented by them to the Governor-General, the advice which it based on those facts, which it presented to him and which was the basis on which he granted a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us make our <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we are not going to sit by and be silent when this Government thinks it can do what it likes without regard to the rights of anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I rise to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against these neutral procedural motions to simply take note of the paper - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to say that I <span class="highlight">protest</span> against these ordinary routine procedures being used to deal with a matter of this sort, especially if I can take it from what was said by my  Deputy  Leader,  Senator Greenwood,  as I can, because it is completely implied, that the Opposition has not been advised of the Government’s intentions with regard to this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have expressed my <span class="highlight">protest</span>, I hope quite unequivocally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span> against that attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House often <span class="highlight">protest</span> against so many areas of government activity, including economic and mining matters, and we attempt to point out that this or that action of the Federal Government is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have protested in the last day or two about the very great authority that was attempted to be handed to the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  in a Bill that was debated in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I knew that as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> Aboriginals went on to the island, remained on the island then left the island when the Darwin police sent a launch there to bring them back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No such power was given to this Parliament in the Constitution, and I <span class="highlight">protest</span> that $ 1 5.75m that we have exacted from the taxpayers pursuant to our taxing powers should be illegally appropriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much the Government may <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the contrary, however much it may twist and distort figures and however much it may emphasise individual cases and incidents and attempt to make people believe that black is white and white is black, this has been the experience of the overwhelming majority of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Chairman, as the first senator to take part in this debate I wish to register a very strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Opposition at the fact that this Bill comes before the Joint Sitting at all, or that it was ever used as a ground to justify seeking the double dissolution of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I observe in passing that the Opposition feels that it has a responsibility to say to the Senate that if the proposal in the amendment is not agreed to we will feel that we have no alternative other than to vote against the 2 Bills in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to enter a <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the course which is being adopted because, unquestionably, it will not be as tidy an approach or as quick an approach as we would like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The undersigned men and women of Australia vigorously <span class="highlight">protest</span> against your Government’s reported provision of Government funds amounting to $150,000 to African Liberation Movements this year, which amounts to contravention of United Nations Charter and is direct interference in internal affairs of African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any stage did any of the 2 1 sitting Liberal or Country Party senators prior to December 1972 <span class="highlight">protest</span> at this abrogation of individual liberty, or move to suspend the Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did any Liberal or Country Party senator elected since 1972 make any similar <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that the Home Buyers Association of South Australia has organised a meeting, to be held at the Adelaide Town Hall on 19 August, in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the high home loan interest rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst Ministers may <span class="highlight">protest</span> and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  may find a scapegoat in the economy, it is the Federal Government which is the responsible party to handle the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to issue my <span class="highlight">protest</span> and say that if some risk is to be taken I will take it on the basis that we may have a little more expenditure on another committee because the Government certainly has not given a sufficient increase in expenditure to the defence forces as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-80">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I issue my <span class="highlight">protest</span> in this way by voting for  Senator Withers  ‘ amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-80">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of  Dr Klugman,  a respected member of the Australian Labor Party, who sent a telegram of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and who gave it to the Press is also reminiscent of the cold war era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span>, because it was not led by a member of the Australian Labor Party or a communist, has been called a bad <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the people of Western Australia know that those decent people- the students, the churchmen and the others- who were out there protesting in favour of freedom were described in the words of  Senator Willesee  as a pack of louts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">protest</span> is valid and in the cause of freedom when it is led by a member of the Australian Labor Party or by a communist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be quite impossible and unjust for the Senate, even though it is a formality of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to put in the paragraphs which call for the dismissal of the Minister, to actually call for the Minister’s dismissal on what has been presented to the Senate over some hours of discussion today on what is known about the Ermolenko affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Opposition to put 2 useless additional arguments in the motion puts senators who want to join in that <span class="highlight">protest</span> in regard to the Baltic states in a very difficult position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to put ourselves in the very foolish position of asking for the dismissal of the Minister as a form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> to be carried by the Senate by voting for all 3 paragraphs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we vote that way, it would be not just an Opposition <span class="highlight">protest</span>- I hope that the Opposition understands the importance of that- but the motion would be carried on the basis that the Opposition has proven its case in the Ermolenko affair and on the basis that we believe the Minister has harmed Australia’s national interest to the very serious extent that he should vacate his office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do join with the <span class="highlight">protest</span> on the central theme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel very deeply for them, as obviously do the Opposition senators in general, and I join in that <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all I would like to <span class="highlight">protest</span> that some of the Budget Bills have been proceeded with by this Government in advance of the time honoured custom of giving the Leader of the Opposition a week in which to reply to the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill were the only one involved perhaps one would not make much of a <span class="highlight">protest</span> but we have had brought into the Senate another important Budget Bill which has already been processed in the House of Representatives; that is the Bill increasing telephone and postal charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span> as strongly as I can at actions which are based upon a misunderstanding and at false accusations which are made about the leaders of the textile industry, both on the company side and on the trade union side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#debate-71">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the applicant who was unsuccessful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not do anything like that and we will let this measure go through, but we will <span class="highlight">protest</span> about it and criticise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to read about the numerous <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings around the countryside to realise how far offside is the Government with the rural sector of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s action is likely to bring severe hardship and possible ruin to sections of a basic primary industry and I feel the situation I have outlined makes a mockery not only of their earlier promises but shows in their true light the sham and hypocrisy of prominent Ministers who <span class="highlight">protest</span> loudly about atomic explosions whilst they continue to encourage and assist imports from countries concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article went on to say that the Greek Government was astounded by this lack of concern and that a <span class="highlight">protest</span> had been made to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point which the article makes is that the Greek Government was astounded by our supposed lack of concern and made a <span class="highlight">protest</span> to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absolutely untrue that any <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made to us over this issue since the Greek Government is much better informed of the facts of the matter than the particular newspaper which published the article to which  Senator Mulvihill  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is exemplified by its refusal to have a single member of the Government attend the <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally which was organised yesterday in Launceston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how much you <span class="highlight">protest</span>; if you are not successful it is a wash-out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not hear any <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the community about looking at too much Australian programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there was a storm of <span class="highlight">protest</span> from  Senator Rae  when I suggested that the Committee had been guilty of unconscionable delay, and that was back, I think, in 1971- about 3 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 6 months after that I protested again, but there is a stage at which one gives up protesting about the delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received a letter of <span class="highlight">protest</span> from the Aboriginal Legal Service in Victoria accompanied by a sticker showing a pencil drawing of a girl with a mass of hair and the caption ‘We hate to get in your hair but this account is overdue’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I notified him that I could not believe that this type of reminder notice came from a Government Department and that protests had been received about it, he took the attitude that he was prepared to withdraw that type of reminder notice and send out a threatening bureaucratic letter telling people to pay up or else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was a very orderly march on Parliament House which was followed by a rally held on the Esplanade; and on the day that the Bill went before the Legislative Council a <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally was held in the Supreme Court gardens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be united in this <span class="highlight">protest</span> to see that discrimination ceases in Australia also- both in respect of the legislation passed in Western Australia and in respect of the Country Party’s attitude particularly to Aborigines within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  own actions and the statements that he has made, such as they are, have indicated his complete indifference and carelessness concerning the welfare of migrants, and I <span class="highlight">protest</span> strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The separate issues, of course, are firstly in relation to accountability as far as the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service is concerned and, secondly, the manner of exercising a right to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not subscribe to the manner of the exercise of the right of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the erection of tents outside Parliament House but I suggest that the Minister is not entitled in any way at all to say to the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service: ‘I will cut off your funds unless you cause those tents to be pulled down.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Agriculture whether he attended the much publicised but not well attended farmers’ <span class="highlight">protest</span> rally outside Parliament House today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did attend the meeting at lunch time and, as far as I know, no member of the Australian Country Party was present although  Mr Anthony  had indicated his support for the <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can understand the difficulties faced by anyone calling a <span class="highlight">protest</span> meeting on a working day but I am sure that the embarrassment would have been greater to  Mr Anthony  or any of his colleagues had he been out there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having recorded that very strong <span class="highlight">protest</span>, the comments that have been made by the Government, both on this Bill and on its policies on local government, strongly remind me of a statement which was made by Francis Bacon about 400 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Poyser is a member of the Victorian Labor Party which had the opportunity to go before these various bodies to express its <span class="highlight">protest</span> and to ask the Environment Protection Authority and the Environment Protection Appeals Board to consider the various matters upon which it is now relying but no attempt was made to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the serious allegation and the extension of torture to young children, will the Leader of the Government raise this inhuman and fiendish development with the Prime Minister and ask him to <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the Australian Government to General Binochet against the torture and murder of political prisoners in Chile? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre, Australia ‘s Ambassador to the United Nations to tell the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who has already written to the Ethiopian authorities making known his concern about this matter, that we agree wholeheartedly with those views and wish to be associated with his <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the Australian Government failed to register its <span class="highlight">protest</span> directly to the new regime? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>12) That the committee report within the shortest reasonable period, not later than 29 May 1975, and that any member of the committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that any member of the Committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is necessary to get an authority- by resolution of both Houses- to provide that any member of the committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If people do not <span class="highlight">protest</span> spontaneously, if they do not <span class="highlight">protest</span> as members of an organisation, if something has to be done to make them <span class="highlight">protest</span>, there is no <span class="highlight">protest</span> at all in my book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that these people would not have protested in this manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this has all been fairly expressed, and I must say that I do not proceed under <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have raised this matter because of the considerable volume of <span class="highlight">protest</span>- <span class="highlight">protest</span> which in my view is justified- which has come from the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the clear evidence that North Vietnam has flagrantly and continually breached the agreements from the day they were signed, and clearly never had any intention of honouring the agreements, has the Minister or the Prime Minister protested to North Vietnam over its massive breaches of the agreements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is entitled to ask the question: Why is it that honourable senators opposite, certain people associated with so-called <span class="highlight">protest</span> movements in Darwin and certain people in the other place have set out to try to create an entirely different apparatus, an entirely different structure and an entirely different arrangement for what must be one of the great challenges for this Government and this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe some of those who are active in the <span class="highlight">protest</span> movement in Darwin are correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Government Party have received very few telegrams and nearly all the telegrams of <span class="highlight">protest</span> have gone to members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite made great protests about the people being so up in arms that many hundreds had signed petitions in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The protests were all phoney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How genuine is the overall <span class="highlight">protest</span> of the people in Darwin who, we are told, are protesting against the provisions contained in this Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today they are organising meetings to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and condemn the action of the Minister in seeking to rebuild Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a little group that the Australian Country Party, through the Legislative Assembly, has set up as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> body to stop this rapid expansion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday I set out essentially the facts which I have already related and I asked whether any <span class="highlight">protest</span> had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked whether if no <span class="highlight">protest</span> had been made because the Minister did not accept the stories, he had apologised or Australia had apologised to the Russian Government for these allegations made about the Russian Government’s hospitality to our Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Minister whether he would elaborate to the people of Australia whether these things occurred and, if they occurred, whether a <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made to the Russian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made, why not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was a <span class="highlight">protest</span> made if these things occurred and, if not, why not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no <span class="highlight">protest</span> was made and these things did occur, should the Prime Minister of this country and his party be subjected to these indignities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Greenwood  is upset about a government doing something he ought to <span class="highlight">protest</span> to that government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of the strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to other persons by  Mr Frank  Galbally, an experienced Melbourne lawyer, relating to the recent trial and gaol sentence in Singapore of Tan Wah-Piow, the 23-year old  president  of the University of Singapore Students Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only voice my <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have any of those Ministers, or the Government of which they are members, protested to the Government of North Vietnam, the People’s Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam or the Khmer Rouge over the indiscriminate attacks on defenceless civilians in South Vietnam and Cambodia by artillery, rockets and mortars employed as instruments of terror? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Government make such a <span class="highlight">protest</span>, even if only to maintain a pretence of even-handedness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third matter is one of slight <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without pressing the matter any further just at the moment, I will see whether or not any interest has been evoked on this side of the chamber in the <span class="highlight">protest</span> which I make about that ground for refuting my amendment, that is to say, that places like Queensland and parliaments like the Parliament of Queensland may prescribe a level of prohibition that we should overrule and give bounty to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventeen hundred public servants will be transferred to Monarto, so there is not a <span class="highlight">protest</span> among the public servants of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protest</span> is being made by a small proportion of public servants- it is insignificant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1 6 months between the signing of the Paris agreements in November 1973 and the correspondence of 20 March 1975 did the Commonwealth Government make any <span class="highlight">protest</span> to North Vietnam about the flagrant breaches by that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government table the text of any such <span class="highlight">protest</span> made in that period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, why did the Government wait until 20 March 1975, after the massive overrunning of South Vietnam by the communists, to make a <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to an article in the ‘Queensland Times’ (21-8-74) headed ‘Ipswich Aborigines a forgotten race’, outlining an interview with  Mr Fisher  of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee I would like to add a few words in <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government protested to the Government of North Vietnam about the shelling of refugee columns and the execution of leading citizens in captured areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no such <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been made, will the Minister explain why not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being asked whether we have protested to North Vietnam about this, that or something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made a general <span class="highlight">protest</span> to North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood interjects and says that we did not <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the executions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to <span class="highlight">protest</span> day after day to both sides we would be doing nothing else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to his earlier answer that Australia would be a laughing stock of the world if it were to <span class="highlight">protest</span> constantly about things like the North Vietnamese shelling of refugees and the execution of opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the Government has protested about imprisonment in South Africa and Indonesia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why <span class="highlight">protest</span> in one case and not in another? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, we have protested not only to those 2 countries about political prisoners but to every country where we believe people are being held without trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that if we started to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at everything that happened during wartime we would be a laughing stock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren  demonstrates his partisan attitude to this Bill by immediately dividing those who may <span class="highlight">protest</span> about voters who should not be able to vote in a certain election on the basis of whether they may vote Labor or Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, the House of Representatives transmits to the Senate the following resolution, which was agreed to by the House of Representatives this day, and requests the concurrence of the Senate therein: That paragraph 12 of the resolution of appointment of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament be omitted and that the following paragraph be substituted: ‘(12) That the Committee report within the shortest reasonable period, not later than 30 September 1975, and that any member of the Committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was a strong <span class="highlight">protest</span> directed to the Minister and to other persons by  Mr Frank  Galbally, an experienced Melbourne lawyer, in respect of the recent trial and gaol sentence, in Singapore, of  Mr Tan  Wah-Piow, the 23 year old  President  of the University of Singapore Student ‘s Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Sub-Committee has promised its discreet full co-operation to ensure that both <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings will have maximum attendances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly want to make my <span class="highlight">protest</span> if the Senate, because the Opposition’s tardiness to sit on Fridays, is to be forced to sit in disjunction with the lower House when the lower House has risen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a <span class="highlight">protest</span> now at the fact that any amendments I may make on behalf of my constituents, and any amendments which this side of the chamber may make, will be useless in the face of the pressures that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somehow or other in the original motion peculiar language was used to the effect that the Committee report within 90 days and that any member of the Committee have power to add a <span class="highlight">protest</span> or dissent to any report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply because Australia does not take the position of an outright ban on the Whaling Commission we become the subject of <span class="highlight">protest</span> and criticism by groups which I think really do not understand the situation, despite our attempts to explain it to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory on 2 1 April last pass a motion protesting against the Government proposals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government intend to ignore the expressions of <span class="highlight">protest</span> by the elected assemblies of the 2 Territories in this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I <span class="highlight">protest</span> that we, as taxpayers, are seeing very little return in terms of value for money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is in government, where an Upper House acts as a brake on hasty legislation, imposes a period of reflection and provides an opportunity for anyone- the farmer, the banker, the industrialist, the representative of labour- to voice his opinion, support or <span class="highlight">protest</span> regarding proposed legislation, after which the Upper House may make or suggest amendments to proposed laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why they have united in an unprecedented manner to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the Bill, against having to accept a whole range of union instructions, having suddenly to be subordinate to union penalties, running the risk of being expelled without compensation …. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade union action has added a new dimension because there is something final about a black ban or a green ban as opposed to the traditional means of <span class="highlight">protest</span> such as letter writing, demonstrations and deputations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not the right of the candidate to express that point of view, just as it is the right of Commonwealth public servants to assemble in <span class="highlight">protest</span> outside Parliament House and express themselves in letters, telegrams, and resolutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that I rise, for about the twentieth time in the 25 years that I have been a senator, to <span class="highlight">protest</span> with all the spirit of which I am capable at the imposition which the monopoly of this union represents upon the trade of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise it because I am interested to know whether the Government feels that this is a matter at any stage for legislative prohibition or restraint, or whether it is a matter which ought to be left to the persons who are appointed to a bench to decide for themselves or for parties to the litigation to raise by way of <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know there has been criticism at times that there have been inspired petitions but, be that as it may, they still enable the constituent to make his or her <span class="highlight">protest</span> known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Sub-Committee has promised its discreet full co-operation to ensure that both <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings will have maximum attendances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cite a report which was published in the  West Australian  on 12 July last of a meeting addressed by  Mr R.  S. Nords, acting State Manager of National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd who, I understand, was one of the major organisers behind that spontaneous campaign of <span class="highlight">protest</span> which the general public and insurance company staffs have been conducting for the last couple of months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this spontaneous campaign of <span class="highlight">protest</span> I recall that in one day in this Parliament I received 20-odd letters all with identical enclosures, all apparently typed on the same typewriter, posted in 2 post boxes and bearing identical postage stamps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently I was supposed to be gullible enough to believe that these 20-odd identical letters of <span class="highlight">protest</span> typed on the same machine in, I think, the office of the National Mutual Life Association,  Mr Norris’s  company, were part of a spontaneous display of opposition by private but deeply concerned citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Agriculture seen in today’s  Australian  a report that the Queensland Government will <span class="highlight">protest</span> against a decision by the Australian Government to suspend the $28m dairy adjustment program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that if such a <span class="highlight">protest</span> were forthcoming from the Queensland Premier it would have little or no effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industrial action was taken by that union as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the delay in finalising an organisational review of the regulatory and licensing sections of the Postmaster-General’s Department in all States that occurred when the Australian Post Office was in operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point that ought to be made is that when the companies were asked for this information they protested at the fact that they were being required to give information that they regarded as being confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should say that the one company I have contacted did <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact of the matter is that at least one company did <span class="highlight">protest</span> and did stress that this material should be kept confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore take the opportunity to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at what is obviously recognisable, to say that I do not support it and to appeal to those members of the Opposition who have previously- privately or publicly- expressed their view that it is wrong for the Senate to deny the right of a government to exist except under quite extraordinary circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cables of <span class="highlight">protest</span> would have been sent, there would have been publicity and there would have been Press statements aimed at shaming the particular offending government into doing something about the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister lay on the table of the Senate the text of any such <span class="highlight">protest</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that he would <span class="highlight">protest</span> publicly, vigorously and persistently because it is only by shaming these governments by public exposure of what they are doing that we are likely to get results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>If it has been prepared to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and to raise its voice in condemnation then I ask the Minister to table the protests which have been made and the messages which have been sent so that that position can be clarified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the impertinence of indirect insinuations as to what they were without any knowledge and, I suggest, without either of them ever having perused anything but the utterance yesterday of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  which was a hypothetical addendum to an extraordinary viewpoint that  Sir Richard  Eggleston put down a week or two ago and as to which I have searched in vain to find any text which supports it in the slightest degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the relationship between the previous Labor Government and the Queen’s representative, that was the principle underlying our form of <span class="highlight">protest</span> yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been demonstrated that the action of the journalists in stopping work as a <span class="highlight">protest</span> was not sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> have we heard from either the Prime Minister or his Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that point on and in this debate in particular it seems that Opposition members, almost to a man, have consistently concerned themselves with what they believed were the unfortunate occurrences of October, November and December of 1975.I believe that the 60-odd empty seats in this chamber last Tuesday when this Parliament was opened in the traditional manner really provided mute evidence not of <span class="highlight">protest</span> but really of insult to the institution of this Parliament, to the representatives of the people of Australia, to the Governor-General himself and, I guess, through him to the Monarch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that those empty seats provided mute evidence not of <span class="highlight">protest</span> but of insult to the very institution that the Australian democracy needs so desperately to maintain and develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that mute <span class="highlight">protest</span>, that insult, was proved later in the day to be in some measure humorous and in some measure ironical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we moved to the Senate gardens to take some cool drinks and general refreshments a measure of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> and insult had suddenly dissipated, because out there where the drinks were on and the sandwiches were around we found the former Prime Minister, most of his family and indeed many of his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have recorded my <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the appropriate manner and I hope that the Government will pay regard to my protestations in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the motion for first reading of this money Bill I desire to make some <span class="highlight">protest</span> at certain answers to questions on notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I could <span class="highlight">protest</span> at many answers, I refer particularly to 2 answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that my colleague  Senator Robertson  is most upset about it, and I hope that the Country Party senator and that man in the other place affectionately known as Silent Sam will also be heard to <span class="highlight">protest</span> on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the real test of good taste must lie with the viewing public at all times and their capacity to turn off the station or to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that there was widespread <span class="highlight">protest</span> last night and I say that without in any way attempting to adjudicate on what happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it is, at this stage they are having their <span class="highlight">protest</span> rallies in the areas in which they live because they have been conned into believing that the last 3 years of Labor Government was the reason for the crisis developing within the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the information I gave then- I will check to see whether it is accurate- was that our Ambassador in China had been instructed to call upon the Chinese Government to make a <span class="highlight">protest</span> on behalf of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland Council for Civil Liberties wishes to draw your attention to the threat to civil liberties and the rule of law repesented by a recent Cabinet decision to over-rule the decision by the Commissioner of Police and the then Minister to hold an inquiry into certain police actions on the occasion of a student <span class="highlight">protest</span> march on 29 July 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of those remarks I said, referring specifically to the Queensland police, that 90 per cent of them were honest, that a minority of them were corrupt and that the decision makers at government level were ensuring that the position remained this way because every time a public inquiry was called for there was a great <span class="highlight">protest</span>, much throwing up of arms and nobody wanting to go on with the public inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is also of importance is that no inquiry was to be held until complaints were made, and then an inquiry was made under <span class="highlight">protest</span> through the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is not adhered to I will use everything within the rules, subject to your rulings,  Mr President,  to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I, Jennifer Howlett of Bracewell via Mt Larcom, wish to lodge my <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the mining of this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I Maurice Redmond Mclnally of East End Mt Larcom, wish to make a <span class="highlight">protest</span> over the Queensland Government giving the right to Darra Cement and Lime Company the lease to open cut mining on our property, which we understand under the Act, open cut mining, and the first 30 centimetres of top soil is prohibited, so the Government is wrong in granting the lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that meeting our  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group,  Mr George  Lucke, wanted to take a tape of the proceedings of the meeting and  Mr Camm  told him that if he were going to tape the meeting he would walk out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time  Mr Lucke  endeavoured to put the case of the <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group it appeared to us that  Mr Camm  had no intention of listening to him or others as he would ‘squash’ what they were saying immediately by talking them down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This deprived us of the right of appeal if the results of the hearing were unfavourable to the <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In May 1976 when the Premier was in Mt Larcom campaigning for the forthcoming election for Port Curtis he extended an invitation for a deputation from the Mt Larcom <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group comprising the  Chairman, Mr George  Lucke and four delegates (of which I was one) to meet him and  Mr Camm  in Brisbane to discuss our problems on the 24th June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are grateful to this newspaper for allowing us our democratic right to <span class="highlight">protest</span> and be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Camm advised if we still wished to <span class="highlight">protest</span>, our path lay in a Court Hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were rumours, prior to the departure of the five members of the deputation that  Mr Alan  Gent, a farmer that Darra was to buy out initially, and a critic of the <span class="highlight">protest</span> Group, had a written invitation to be present at this meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were dismayed and disgusted to hear that  Mr Gent  had been allowed entry into what was to have been a conference between the deputation from the Mt Larcom and District Mining <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group,  Mr Camm  and  Mr Petersen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This five minutes gave  Mr Gent  adequate time to disparage the district the deputation from the <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group had come to defend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood from the members of the Group who travelled to Brisbane that  Mr Petersen  and  Mr Camm  had said they would arrange for a round table conference between the Mines Department, the mining Company, and the <span class="highlight">Protest</span> Group before the decision was made with regard to the leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The majority of the members are conservative people, and it pained them to be forced by aversion to the Company’s and the Government’s policies into this form of <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one considers that it is intended to phase out this subsidy, it is amazing how little reaction there has been from the farming community, especially when we consider the hullabaloo, the outcry, the <span class="highlight">protest</span> meetings and the rhetoric that was expressed when the Labor Government took the step 2 years ago of phasing out the superphosphate bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Canberra Times  of today- Wednesday, 5 October- has reported on its front page under the heading ‘Aborigines <span class="highlight">Protest</span> at Mine Start’ that the Ranger uranium mining project in the Northern Territory plans to have the construction of a dam, road works, et cetera, commenced shortly and before the wet season begins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has it brought in legislation in this Parliament, but we find  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  bringing in legislation in his Parliament which prevents the young people in Brisbane or any other major city in Queensland from holding a democratic <span class="highlight">protest</span> march. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Debate on this procedural motion provides a good opportunity to do as  Senator Georges  has done, that is, to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the procedure being followed in this chamber today, not only in respect of the motion seeking the rapid passage of a Bill but also in respect of what occurred earlier in the day when the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Withers)  decided to gag debate when there was an opportunity to discuss what the Senate ought to be able to do today and tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that it had been my understanding that the Croatian Embassy, as it has been called, would be there for a short time, that it would be a focal point for the Croatians of Australia and that it would symbolise the views that they hold very stronglyviews which in our society those people of course have a right to express by peaceful <span class="highlight">protest</span> and demonstration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having been approached today, quite spontaneously, by dried fruit producers- people whose names were not known to me, people I have never spoken to before- who were protesting not about the intention in the four Bills which are before the Senate but about the fact that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has failed adequately to consult with the producers concerned, I feel that I must register a <span class="highlight">protest</span> on their behalf in addition to the <span class="highlight">protest</span> that I have already stated on behalf of members of the Senate collectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like so much of the industrial legislation for which this Government has been responsiblethe establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau; the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act significantly increasing the scope of the punitive or penal powers under that legislation; and the Commonwealth Employees Act vesting powers of suspension, stand down or dismissal of public employees engaged in just about any conceivable form of industrial action; specific provisions of legislation like the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, aimed quite specifically and directly at particular forms of legitimate trade union <span class="highlight">protest</span>- this Bill is just another crude and vulgar piece of legislative union-bashing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tribunal squeaked a little <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the gauntlet’s having been thrown down by  Mr Murdoch,  but in reaching its decision it manifestly failed to do anything so courageous as to bend down and pick up the glove so laid on the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that these changes of view can be brought about only if countries such as Australia constantly <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the effects of the policies, visit these countries, and do the very things about which  Senator Walsh  has complained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister cannot do anything about this procedural manoeuvre, will she have the Department of Health make a formal <span class="highlight">protest</span> so that the tobacco industry is similarly forced to justify claims such as that a certain type of country is marlboro country, that a particular type of cigarette is cool and that another is as fresh as an alpine stream and so that such advertising is stopped until these claims can be clinically justified before an impartial tribunal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That report was also tabled in the Parliament of Victoria under a State Liberal Government and I stress, without <span class="highlight">protest</span>, without any synthetic outrage from any sections of the media or members of Liberal and Country parties which pretend or purport to have been outraged by events in Sydney in the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I was trying to make was that we should <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the highest level- government to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a fine line between the rights of a person to <span class="highlight">protest</span> about some government decision that they object to and the rights and privileges of people in the community to be able to go about their normal day’s work while they are objecting and protesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we take the matter a little further and talk about the art of <span class="highlight">protest</span>, it was conceded as a result of some interjections that generally there is some reason for a dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Chairman,  again I <span class="highlight">protest</span> most strongly to you about the Minister in charge of the Bill not being in the House during the Committee stage to answer questions posed by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am talking on the clause I want to lodge my strongest <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which the Minister moved at a very late hour in the morning that this Bill be treated as an urgent Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consideration of the Bill as a whole is regarded by the Opposition as a course being undertaken under <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leaveThe Opposition wishes to make its usual <span class="highlight">protest</span> about the sort of statement that has just been put down by  Senator Webster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I make the formal <span class="highlight">protest</span> that the Opposition has made every time this has been attempted since the Government came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision made in 1978 to abolish sixmonthly indexation of pensions led to massive protests by pensioners throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who had never before protested about a measure which had been undertaken by government, did so with determination last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Brisbane, the capital of the State which I represent, pensioners gathered in their thousands to go to the Brisbane City Hall to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the abolition of six-monthly indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout Queensland pensioners gathered to rally and to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at what had happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was especially poignant that these pensioners who live on what is regarded as the playground of Queensland, a place one usually associates with people on high levels of income, came out in their hundreds to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They not only gathered and protested in a hall against the abolition of six-monthly indexation but also took to the streets of Bundaberg to voice their <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They took that risk and went in to the streets of Bundaberg to voice their <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to record my <span class="highlight">protest</span> about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the Opposition has shown some <span class="highlight">protest</span> this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the action is a go-slow, work to rule or any other industrial <span class="highlight">protest</span>, short of strike action constitutes industrial action and therefore penalises stood-down employees is entirely at the discretion of the Director-General of the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument for consistency appeals, because after all principles of consistency can be argued, whereas one can do nothing but <span class="highlight">protest</span> about an arbitrary statement or decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet where has  Mr Ellicott  ‘s voice of <span class="highlight">protest</span> been in the last 24 hours? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I can only come to the same conclusion with respect to  Mr Ellicott  that I did with respect to  Senator Webster,  and that is that if a person is of Italian extraction living in Leeton, he is fair game, anything can be done to him and there is no need to <span class="highlight">protest</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, if one is a member of the Sydney White Anglo-Saxon Protestant establishment, one is supposed to be protected by that establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope he does and explains why he was so outraged by the events in the New South Wales Parliament on 26 September and the Press reaction to them; why  Mr Anthony  was so outraged by them; why the National Country Party was outraged by them; why  Mr Killen  was outraged; why  Mr Ellicott  was outraged; why the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was outraged, when none of them have uttered a word of <span class="highlight">protest</span> about what happened in the New South Wales Parliament yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that is the way that the Senate is to operate, we <span class="highlight">protest</span> against it most vehemently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most States, not only Queensland and Western Australia, although they have become the most notorious in this respect, have on their statute books legislation which, if enforced in a ham-handed way, is manifestly offensive to rights of public assembly and freedom of association, assembly and political <span class="highlight">protest</span> in the public domain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I preface it by reminding the Minister that the Australian Government recently delivered a <span class="highlight">protest</span> note to the Czech Government concerning the imprisonment of Czech dissidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will such a <span class="highlight">protest</span> be delivered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) 1979-80 to express my dissatisfaction or to <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the Government ‘s intention to deal with the rest of the business before the Senate rises for the summer recess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think this is the first time that a <span class="highlight">protest</span> has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the conventions of war, and more importantly to humanitarianism, what has the Australian Government done to <span class="highlight">protest</span> against this practice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise my voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> at the way in which these people are being denied economic and social justice apparantly based on comparable standards on a year to year basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when there is such an imbalance- a gross imbalance- against the people of New South Wales, I, as a senator, must raise my voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> either at the way in which the Department is treating its appeals or, on the other hand, at the way in which the Department is regarding the Appeals Tribunal in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Minister sits in the House and does not answer, remains mute in response to the questions that have been posed by my colleagues,  Senator Bishop, Senator Primmer, Senator Walsh  and  Senator Keeffe,  and while there is a report of that nature drawn to the attention of the Committee of the Whole by the Senate Estimates Committee, it is my responsibility to rise at this early hour of the morningafter the Parliament has been sitting for well over 12 hours and after we have all been here for a period of 17 hours- and raise my voice in <span class="highlight">protest</span> against the way in which the Government is conducting the affairs of this nation, and to seek sensible responses from the Minister to our questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
