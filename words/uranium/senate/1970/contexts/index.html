  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did this indicate that mill tailings piles associated with the generation of electricity from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contained appreciable amounts of the radioactive decay products of thorium-230: radon-222, together with some short-lived polonium-218 and polonium-2 14, lead-214 and bismuth-214. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry First Report contains the following statement on page 4 1 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate why he allowed himself to be party to a device in putting down a very important statement on the problems that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers are facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the front page of this morning’s  Australian,  where under the heading ‘Miner can’t meet <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contract’, it is reported that Queensland Mines Ltd, owner of Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the Northern Territory, cannot meet its contract to supply 300 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Japanese this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is further reported that the  chairman  of Queensland Mines,  Mr James  Millner, has stated that because of the borrowing terms imposed by the Government, the interim agreement with the Federal Government to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the government stockpile was regarded by the company as impracticable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 1972 agreement between the Japanese company and Queensland Mines cannot be fulfilled, will it be detrimental to any future market developed by Australia with the Japanese for the purchase of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps has the Government taken, or will it take, to implement the recommendations of the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry which states that immediate and urgent energy research and development programs should be undertaken into (a) liquid fuels to replace petroleum and (b) energy sources other than fossil and nuclear fusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This statement relates to the international implications of the Government’s decision to develop new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits for export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no doubt that the decision it has taken on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> represents the only responsible course in terms of Australia’s international relations and the objective of nonproliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Important though these considerations are in foreign policy terms, I wish now to concentrate on the relationship between <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export and the problem of nuclear weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem was a paramount concern to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So are the requirements for prior Australian consent to high enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia and the requirement that adequate physical security be maintained on the nuclear industries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the Government has decided to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export the task will be to press ahead and implement our safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, in which countries the material will be processed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride, are parties to the NPT and require stringent safeguards on the material processed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, in this regard as the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be finally processed into enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United States it will attract the full force of the safeguards policy recently announced by President Carter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) In the light of the recent Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development’s review of world energy requirements to 1985 where it is stated that the world forecasted nuclear capacity of 513 gigawatts by 1985 had been revised to 325 gigawatts by 1985 and in the light of large reductions in the forecasted nuclear capacity of Japan, Germany and Great Britain, what countries will be markets for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also refer the Minister to a statement by  Mr Anthony  on 1 7 November of last year when he said that he believed that Australia should supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines and said that it wants 3,000 tonnes from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the current objection by the States to the lack of consultation between the Commonwealth and the States in respect of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation presently before the Parliament to which I referred yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 15 March 1978 (Hansard page 586)  Senator Tehan  addressed to me as Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate a question without notice which related to the status for income tax purposes of gifts to a body opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I trust it will be sufficient if I reiterate that gifts to this or any other body whose purpose is to oppose <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining are not deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I respond to  Senator Walsh’s  remarks by simply drawing his attention to the various pieces of legislation that have gone out of their way to indicate some five or six heads of power upon which the Commonwealth has relied for its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that the report states that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales to the mid-1980s might amount to 33,000 tonnes or even to the upper limit of 55,000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While there has been some weakening in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market in recent years, this amount still represents a very considerable level - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Report estimates that the annual demand in the year 2000 would be 178,000-338,000 tonnes <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which represents a significant increase in demand over the next 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor’s policy is that while we are not opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, we are opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when we do not have sufficient knowledge about safeguards to protect the human race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it also true that updated assessments show that world stocks of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> may in fact run out sooner than world stocks of oil? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the Australian Government’s estimate of the world market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and what are the implications for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, however difficult this may be, what steps can the Government take in a practical way to win a more bipartisan and responsible policy approach in this Parliament to the mining, milling and selling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in order to give firmer confidence to the industry and to Australia’s international trade relations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Teague has asked a question relating to the market prospects for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general I can say that the Government closely assesses this matter and that the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is dependent upon the need for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for nuclear reactors generating electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the reactors now being built have on average around 70 per cent greater capacity than those now operating, and even if the 400 or more additional reactors either firmly ordered or planned are excluded, this will represent a three-fold expansion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements over the next 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australian mines will, of course, find a very ready market in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, after 1990 the question is not whether there will be a market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but whether there will be productive capacity in place to meet the requirements of the reactors then in use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is in general terms the answer to the question relating to the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 19 September 1979  Senator Wriedt  asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, whether I was aware of an article in the  Japan Economic Journal  of 21 August 1979 on possible Japanese participation in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project and whether I could confirm the correctness of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have promised Shoichiro Kobayashi, president of Kansai Electric Power Co., government support for Kansai and other partners’ participation in a joint Japanese-Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development project’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article in the  Japan Economic Journal  referred to Japanese Government support for any proposal by a Japanese consortium to take up an interest in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recent announcement that the Government intends to sell its share in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-83-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not yet made a decision on whether or not to dispose of its interests in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-83-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the most part the direct supervision and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments at Ranger are presently being carried out by officials of the Northern Territory Government in co-operation with Commonwealth authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-83-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said then and I say again that the land rights Bill introduced by the Labor Government contained absolutely no provision for negotiation and consultation between the Aboriginal people and Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also asked a question tonight as to whether some assistance will be given to the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can I get from the Attorney-General, without delay or time for consideration, an answer as to whether in the future the Government is prepared to co-operate with the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council, which co-operation the Council complains in its first report it is not getting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Bell  suggested that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits could again become of major strategic importance, but major deficiencies such as in oil, natural gas, bauxite and nickel have to be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have clamoured in this chamber for the last 3 years that unless the Government gives us clear-cut plans in order to prevent somebody mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or some other mineral, or some big developer like the Hooker company trying to circumvent what I hope and maintain are effective Australian Capital Territory land laws, we are going to find that there will be a permanent state of suspense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the Government has decided to install a natural <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuelled Canadian reactor system in Australia’s first nuclear power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is still room for foreign investment, but I am one who believes that a foreign company has to recognise that if it comes here to take advantage of our natural resources, in addition to paying a small royalty to a State government for the coal or <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or bauxite or whatever it is that is being won, it should, in its own interests as well as in the interests of Australia, give some consideration to taking an Australian element into the company and at least giving Australian investors an opportunity to invest in these undertakings to a greater extent than is the case at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That raw material lay in the ground, just as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has done, in the northern part of Queensland for centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can still share in the development of this country provided that they recognise that they have an obligation to allow Australians to play a part because, after all, in the first instance the bauxite, the coal and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, etc., belong to the Australian people and the investors have been privileged at little or no cost to develop, exploit, produce and sell our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It depends upon the type of reactor which is installed at the proposed nuclear power station in New South Wales whether some of the Australian production of raw <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or the derivatives of raw <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the great deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and the overseas interest in their development, will the Australian Government consider enriching its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or having it fabricated here before selling it overseas in order to get increased export earnings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latter presents only a minor problem of safe storage while awaiting reprocessing for the recovery of the remaining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and plutonium in the fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following a review by the Commonwealth of policy relating to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> the then Minister for National Development on 10th April 1967 announced a new policy designed to stimulate exploration for this mineral and at the same time ensure that Australia’s future requirements of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be met from domestic resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years the search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear, however, that these reserves will put Australia amongst the leading <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers in the world, and it is not over-optimistic to expect that further discoveries will continue to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is not only a valuable mineral, and the probable future source of much of the world’s future industrial power, it is also a material of strategic importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided, in common with the governments of practically all other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exporting countries, to maintain a system of: export control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As with previous policy, all contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will he subject to the approval of the Minister for National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will ensure that the price negotiated for the sale of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister participate in the discussions involving the Ministers for National Development and the Interior, concerning the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves at Nabarlek and the creation of a national park in Arnhem Land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Attorney-General tell the Senate whether the present provisions of the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) Ordinance are intended to prevent the actual control of the development of the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit and the sale of its produce from falling into the hands of overseas companies by contract as opposed to Australia’s losing control by shareholding of such overseas companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as the substantive part of the honourable senator’s question is concerned, the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, controls are provided in particular areas, as in the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1971, the Banking Act 1959-1967 and the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations thereunder, the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965 and in the Companies (Life Insurance Holding Companies) Ordinance 1968-1970 and the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) Ordinance 1970 of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from such cases, and the effect of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1971, the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965, the Companies (Life Insurance Holding Companies) Ordinance 1968-1970 and the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) Ordinance 1970 of the Australian Capital Territory, the Commonwealth Government has not vetoed any company mergers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has any member of the Commission, between the date of notification of a discovery to the Commission and the date upon which the discovery has become public, acquired shares in mining companies which have discovered <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral give urgent consideration to taking appropriate steps to review, either alone or with his appropriate ministerial colleagues, the protection of Australian ownership and control of the valuable deposits of that vital power resource, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, located and to be located in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he review the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) Ordinance and either amend that Ordinance or introduce legislation under the corporations power to bring within provisions similar to those in the present Ordinance relating to the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps are taken by the Commonwealth to verify the claims of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies listed on Australian stock exchanges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the terms of the international agreement on the exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore, to which Australia is a party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Atomic Energy Commission maintains correspondence with mining and prospecting companies which are exploring for, or have made discoveries of, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information is obtained on the location, type of mineralisation and progress in geological and drilling investigations of all known and newly discovered occurrences of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presence of high-grade pitchblende and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ochre mineralisation at Nabarlek was observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since the announcement in September, 1970 by Queensland Mines Limited of its discovery of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Nabarlek the Company has facilitated many visits to the prospect by international experts and groups from overseas with a genuine interest in the prospect and the possibility of obtaining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide concentrates from this source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These overseas experts all agreed that there was significant high-grade <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mineralisation at Nabarlek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> ore or <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrates (yellowcake) may be exported subject to approval of the price by the Minister for National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These comprise a system of international controls and inspections to ensure that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which is sold overseas is used only for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It intervened when there were rumours of the attempted take-over of the MLC Assurance Co. Ltd and in the attempted movements in relation to Queensland Mines Ltd”s great <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That company could buy a controlling interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in Australia not for the purpose of developing the Australian mineral resources but for the purpose of subjugating them so that those resources will not pose a threat to the market enjoyed by the company already existing in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen the Darwin Conservation Society paper entitled ‘The <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Province National Park Suggested Control Over Mining’ dated 19th July 1971? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that when conflict arose in the Northern Territory and I looked for positive steps to be taken I received an answer, as late as today, from the Minister for the Interior which indicates that at some time in 1973 a decision will be made on the Northern Territory national park as to its size and whether certain  areas that may hold <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits will be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that we have great <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is no doubt that enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be a commodity we will be exporting in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The diplomat is there because the moment they want to discuss this question of importing enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from other countries the diplomat will move in and take the matter out of the hands of the technical people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could very well be that we could be a big exporter of enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in a peculiarly suitable position to develop the production of enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and to develop it very rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when the same was said of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but the time came when we discovered that wehad immense deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation applies with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only guess at the amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the fiasco at Nabarlek where many thousands of ions of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were alleged to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of 55,000 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the deposit finished up at 9.000 tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are significant and important difficulties in this matter which relate to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, coal, oil, gas and one might even say timber and various sorts of fuel and power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for which there is a very limited market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can we say in relation to oil and gas which, basically at the moment, have an unlimited future on the consumer market, that we should adopt the same policy that we adopt in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor will stimulate the growth of nuclear technology, particularly by the earliest possible Com monwealth initiative to establish nuclear power stations using enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in reactors of basically similar design. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What assurances have we that wherever <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects are undertaken between now and 1973 we will not have further situations like we had at Finniss River? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have a secret fear that some geologist will go to the Mount Kelly ranges and find <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or something else and then the Minister will come in here and say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has considered the question of the establishment of a northern national park in the Northern Territory in the area where significant <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discoveries have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the nature of an enabling or umbrella agreement and will clear the way, notably through the provisions on safeguards procedures, for private enterprise to follow up with particular agreements for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Swartz)  and I issued a Press statement indicating that certain amendments would be made to the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) Ordinance 1970 of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those amendments have now been made by the Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, in December 1970, the Australian Capital Territory Companies (<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Companies) Ordinance T97Q was made giving effect to the Government decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment applies equally, to all persons who had acquired shares in either of the 2 <span class="highlight">uranium</span> companies before the announcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There the company stated that it would not bring the Jim Jim <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit into production until satisfactory sales had been negotiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Canada they are saying that an exploration company will not bring Jim Jim <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits into production until satisfactory sales contracts have been negotiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator is no doubt aware that there have been 3 major <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discoveries within or adjacent to the proposed park area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proven reserves are now estimated to be in excess of 100,000 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that with careful planning it is possible to utilise the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and at the same time conserve the outstanding anthropological and ecological features of the, area about which more people than only  Senator Mulvihill  are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would also apply to the 3 companies seeking leases to mine in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone asked what our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources were, nobody would know either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Since then large <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits have been discovered within and adjacent to this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The future role of the Committee will no doubt include assessments of safety factors in the development of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the AttorneyGeneral tell the Senate exactly what steps  the  Government has  taken  to  ensure that  foreign shareholdings in the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits do not exceed 15  per  cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has indicated in action it has taken with regard to the MLC Insurance Co., the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies and broadcasting and television that in particularly significant areas it has imposed a limit on the amount of overseas ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he seen Press reports attributed to  Senator Murphy  that the Government’s refusal to allow further registration of foreign-owned shares in 2 <span class="highlight">uranium</span> companies was an excuse for non-action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government has taken a very firm stand regarding overseas shareholdings in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> companies and in view of the Minister’s recent strong statement, how does such a comment ‘an excuse for non-action’ relate itself to current Government policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason for them was simply the statement made over the weekend that in the administration of the ordinances relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies, under which there is a limit on the amount of overseas ownership, the experience of the last 6 months is that there has been a drop in the level of overseas ownership in these companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the statement of the Minister for National Development that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant is to be established in Australia, will the Minister give serious consideration to its establishment in South Australia, as that State had a successful <span class="highlight">uranium</span> treatment plant some years ago until its contract with the United Kingdom Government ran out and its Department of Mines was regarded very highly for its research on the treatment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite a while ago now, but because of my association with Broken Hill I remember very well the work in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Radium Hill and the hope that South Australia had that this would lead to something quite substantial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, is it not equally as logical to site the envisaged <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia, based on such a nuclear power provision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee makes the following comments with regard to such a policy: e Australia can continue to seek export opportunities for coal, iron ore and bauxite without fear of depleting its own reserves; o there is a need for cost-benefit studies to determine the economics of exporting raw materials as compared with their processing to various stages in Australia prior to export; and o if a decision is made to build a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia, control should be retained in Australian hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we have found that in the pursuit of economic and commercial convenience, we have sold a great deal of the very valuable very high frequency space which is just as much one of the - I think I could use this term - mineral resources of this country as is <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister know that the report states that  Mr Millner, Chairman  of Queensland Mines, claims that $40m has already been lost because of the lack of a stated Government policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and a refusal to renew the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> companies’ licence to explore? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Minerals and Energy,  Mr Connor,  that there was no need for undue haste in renewing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> leases and exploration licences of Queensland Mines Ltd. How does the Government justify its acceptance of this cavalier and unfair attitude of the Minister in the face of the serious financial plight of this company and its associates, which plight is directly attributable to the Minister’s attitudes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government allow the companies which have pioneered major <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration and development of deposits in Australia to go to the wall because of a stubborn and callous disregard of urgently needed determinations by the Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Minerals and Energy, concerns the Government’s announced proposal to initiate immediate discussions with Japan towards a feasibility study into the establishment in Australia of a joint Japanese-Australian centrifuge type <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant- a plant which, properly located and controlled, could be of great significance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will note that we have also agreed to enter into 2 further agreements with Japan- a Cultural Agreement and an agreement on the protection of migratory and other birds- as well as to conduct wide-ranging official discussions on a number of issues including access for agricultural products, tariffs, and minerals and energy matters, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the position with regard to natural gas and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Melboure ‘Age’ stated: ‘Gas, <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> for Japan, says the PM indicating quite clearly, as the major text to the article under the headline indicates, that we have a market for our gas and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The journey to Japan was launched with the great statement: ‘We are going to make a pact with Japan on the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to see with Japan a negotiation whereby we can have in Australia a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese are going to build their own <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese have just started testing one of the centrifuges, one of perhaps the half million that are necessary for a centrifuge system of diffusion enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and in the next few years they will have about 180 of them running, not half a million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows we were going to talk about a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant but of course nothing was done’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I .fer the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Conservation to a report which appeared in a recent edition of the Melbourne ‘Age’ which claims that the Minister for the Environment and Conservation and the Minister for Minerals and Energy are on a collision course over the proposal to establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should we be doing at this moment about a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we be selling our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> without too much constraint on the world markets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of a feasibility study into a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant is involving literally thousands of millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, and if we can understand this, the need for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a fuel will have a whole life of 30 years because the fusion process does not depend upon <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But above all, because I am talking about the Australian Atomic Energy Commission I pose this question and we need to have some very accurate answers in the months and years ahead if we are to make the right judgments: Will we have to use our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> either sparingly because we have to conserve it or freely because we do not have to conserve it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we go into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment because that would be good or should we put it aside because it would be unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike many nations we have a great deal of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposed at the recent meeting of Japanese and Australian Ministers a joint study of the feasibility of establishing in Australia a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment facility utilising Japanese technology and finance and which will be owned by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As announced in the communique, officials will continue to hold discussions relating to mineral and energy resources, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that he made some statement yesterday in the Parliament to the effect that coal will be used as a bridging energy source between the fuels we are using now and the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With complacent reliance on unlimited oil supplies, nations have ignored research and development of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, coal and ultimately, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is one of these energy sources and we have an objective of full Australian ownership in development projects involving <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> field in particular, and desirably also in oil, we aim to adopt the same sort of approach in exploration as I have already outlined for development of these minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those resources, of course, are primarily oil, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, natural gas and coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have not let the exploiters come in and mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or exploit our other great resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is our policy in terms of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has proven high grade reserves totalling about 20 per cent of the known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a significant <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producing country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The projection at present is that the world will become <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hungry by 1990. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fusion process does not use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but uses heavy water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fusion process, I repeat, does not rely on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and therefore would be free of any difficulty created by a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> shortage should there be one in 1990. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second permanent long time source of energy is clearly solar energy, and clearly in the next 30, 40 or 50 years solar energy will be developed by a direct energy conversion process so, either by fusion or solar energy, the world will move into a stage where the need for energy for electrical power generation will not depend on coal, oil, natural gas or <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, then certainly <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, coal, oil and natural gas will not have the kind of massive use that they have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same position applies with regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What have we heard about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, apart from the abysmal silence of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  with regard to the Atomic Energy Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So he said that we are thinking of setting up a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But also, he was raising the question, I think without knowing what he was doing, of a situation in which the world, whilst it is now in a state of some potential shortage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is likely to be in a state of potential glut of enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States of America has <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, the United States can supply the world with enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until the early 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can any one say that if we produced enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we would be able to sell it in a world in which other plants are marketing it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, equally, can anyone say that we cannot produce and market enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a world in which the present nuclear rectors use the fuel in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> 235 in an inefficient manner so that only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the potential is used, it is vital that breeder reactors should be developed so that the enriched fuel which is taken up to a few more per cent in capacity is used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hungry world in the short term it is important that we should have a policy, and we have none at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- other than an utterly extraordinary one on the Narbarlek- Ranger leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no policy on atomic energy development or experimentation to determine cost benefits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment or the relative merits of nuclear reactors of the conventional type and breeder reactors, or on atomic energy in the fusion area of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick also attacked the Australian Government over having no policy with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government has a very good policy with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It wants to buy 30,000 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and cannot get anyone to supply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may make an aside here, we are now coming to the stage of energy use throughout the world at which if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is not used fairly soon, there will be new techniques in the use of heavy water to produce power and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that we now have may be completely useless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in no small measure due to the quadrupling of oil prices that a threat is posed to the economic viability and foreign exchange reserves of some of the world’s major industrial powers, which have complacently relied on unlimited cheap oil imports, and have ignored research and development of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, coal, and ultimately <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to world ranking deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, we have significant deposits of other minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The specific cases are <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, crude oil, natural gas and black coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar situation exists in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industry does not seem to be able to get a policy out of the Government on so many issues related to energy, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to the pipeline system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have developed and are developing a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy to guarantee the proper development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1 8 months that we have been in office we as a Government have seen the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> doubled and the contracts that were written and hailed by the Opposition as being of great achievement in 1972 look rather puny against the prices which are being paid on the world market today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just leaving the subject of oil for a moment, I would point out that there is a crying need for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> throughout the world at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister how much <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we have sold over the last 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have we sold one ounce of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to deny that or at least get one of the Government speakers to deny that the Government will not permit any company in Australia even to extract a bulk specimen of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prescribed substances under the regulations are broadly those from which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide may be extracted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of this debate I will refer simply to the necessity to obtain a licence from the Minister before anybody anywhere in Australia, whether it be in a Territory or in a State, can work a mine or even do any exploratory work for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or acquire, produce, possess or dispose of ore bearing <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of the Act and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as to its use in the production of atomic weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act itself was coloured by views as to the great strategic importance of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, the Act gives to the Commonwealth the property in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> anywhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act simply gives to the Crown, in right of the Commonwealth, the ownership of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out in the explanatory note which accompanied the regulations that there have been significant discoveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, in recent years and because of its economic and strategic importance the Government is concerned that the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in Australia should be undertaken on a coherent and rational basis and with due regard to developments in the world market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the way in which the Minister purports to carry out that policy is simply to pass these regulations which say virtually that no one can touch <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or do anything with it without a licence from the Minister for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has not been free of legal rules and restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies have explored for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are well known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines that have existed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all the companies that have explored for, found and developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines have done so under well recognised, well known and well established mining laws under either the Mining Ordinance of the Northern Territory or State mining laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not questioning in any way the proposition that there ought to be control over the right to mine and the way in which one mines <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, or indeed any other mineral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Commonwealth Government has adequate powers in regard to the national interest as far as mining, including the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is concerned under its export control powers generally and under regulations that have been made under those powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those powers are quite adequate and they relate specifically to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in Australia should be vigorously and promptly exploited for defence and industrial purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Energy Commission had been set up to supervise generally the prospecting for and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  purpose was to encourage private enterprise to explore the mineral resources of the Northern Territory and, one might also add, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mineral resources throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> over the years under titles which had been obtained under State and Northern Territory mining laws great reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have been found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, they have been found to such an extent that they represent probably 20 to 25 per cent of the world’s known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pretty clear that there is vast potential in Australia for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, with encouragement by the Government there could be a much greater increase in Australia’s known reserves and there would be if we had a government which encouraged and which did not inhibit- as seems to be the negative policy of the present Minister and the Government- the exploration for and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason given by the Government as to why it wants these powers is to plan a coherent and rational policy for the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Opposition are not seeking to take away proper government control and supervision of mining for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have emphasised that adequate laws already exist in the Northern Territory and in the States under which people and companies seeking to explore for and to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must obtain exploration licences and licences to develop mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the regulations, despite the title one may have acquired under the State or Territory laws, now he will not be able to work a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine or effectively carry out exploration with a licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one drills a hole and gets some substance containing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> one will be in possession of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in the Government’s eyes, one happens to be unlucky enough to obtain a successful drill hole and to be in possession of some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> one will not be able to dispose of it without the licence of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is able to come in and take over complete control not only of the development and working of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine but also the exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It hardly seems to be necessary to provide a control on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because clearly the Government already has that control, as I have indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that would give the Government some sort of powers in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which, apparently, the Government would not have over minerals generally throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this: The Senate will remember that just prior to this time it became clear that Queensland Mines Ltd held a relatively small but very rich deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory on an Aboriginal reserve, in an area likely to be designated as a national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty which the Government faced and still faces in relation to this policy regarding Queensland Mines is that long before the policy was established and long before the Woodward Committee was set up Queensland Mines obtained titles to explore for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which it found at Nabarlek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had entered into contracts with overseas purchasers in relation to its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Of course, the Government was also in a rather embarrassing position as a result of the fact that at that stage the company could not mine the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and could not fulfil its contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Government conceived the idea that the way out of this problem for the Government I suppose it was not such a good way out for the company- was to give Queensland Mines Ltd access to other deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which were the subject of exploration by other companies under other titles and rights to explore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of their exploration initiative and great expenditure of money, those companies had found other deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The company that was to be the bunny in this exercise was Peko-Wallsend EZ which had found large deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a place known as Ranger in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that the Commonwealth felt that it would authorise the access to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> desposits owned by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now trying to dress up its action in these grandiose terms by stating that the purpose of this regulation is to have a coherent and rational plan for Australia’s national resources, in this instance its reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could be more likely to inhibit any search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has found a very large deposit- approximately 100,000 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. Perhaps it is not of the highest grade, but it is a very economic deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was up there recently and it is very clear that there is a great <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other significant deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in and about this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that a great <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province has been discovered there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been discovered only because of the incentive which had been given to exploration by the Liberal-Country Party coalition government over the years it was in office, together with the assurance that if a company did take the risks and spent millions of dollars on this enterprise, such a company would then receive a title to mine and develop the fruits of its exploration and initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when the Minister replies today he will indicate, though I doubt that he will be able to do so, that this Government has a policy in relation to the exploration for minerals and attempts to increase our known energy reserves and in particular, of course, our reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with which we are concerned in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the regulations appear to be designed to establish the Federal Minister for Minerals and Energy as the one and only authority in Australia to control the whole area of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining from the exploration right through to the development of the deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of - the sitting I had turned to the question of the Opposition ‘s policy in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seems to be groping at the moment for some sort of policy for the redevelopment of the Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine, but that is a very small mine and represents a special problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we would expect to see is some broad positive policy from the Government in regard to the need to expand our exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the upgrading and increasing of what are already very significant reserves of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also believe that part and parcel of such an interest in the development of and exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be to permit some reasonable export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide or the ore in its yellow cake form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make sure that the Act is extended in the fashion he desires, he has given comparisons with other countries that are leaders in the free enterprise system in the world and which have similar, if not greater, powers in relation to the possession, use and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in their national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The documents which I have, and which no doubt are available in the Parliamentary Library, indicate that the United States of America and Canada have very strict controls residing in their national governments for the sort of management of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources that the Australian Minister is seeking here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I am suspicious, especially following their introduction by the Government, of the motives behind a number of Government moves, but in seeking to regulate the production and usage of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources the Minister would be doing no more than  Senator Durack  has asked, and that is that there should be limited exports under strict conditions which are subject to the national interest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there has to be some vision of Australia’s future fuel and power needs, and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, on the assessment which we have now of Australia’s fuel reserves of all forms, will probably play a very heavy part at around the turn of the century or thereafter in the supply of Australia’s power needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister has not produced any definite plan for the development of minerals in general in Australia and of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that  Senator Durack  did not read much of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy put out by his leader because there is nothing much in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere in any argument from either side so far can I see any real statement of Australia’s future needs for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So where is the policy which will provide the long term management of Australia’s fuel resources and provide for the power that will come from Australia’s own <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is so reasonable that this regulation should be defeated and should remain defeated until the Government can produce its plans until those who have taken the initiative and found Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources know what is in store for them and know what proportion of their finds are economic to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I was furnished with a copy of the most recent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy in Canada, so I am informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to read to the Senate the brief details of the Canadian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each mining company will have a reserve margin for domestic supply allocated to it by a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Resource Appraisal Group within the Energy Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This margin would be based on the ‘ratio of each company’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources to the total Canadian recoverable resources from all such companies estimated by the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Appraisal Group’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some big deals cooking about Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and this Government does just the opposite to getting its policy into the open at this particular time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether a certain amount of bait has been held out to the Senate, to the Parliament and to the mining companies in general to obtain general approval of this ordinance, because the Minister has been making public statements about the setting up in Australia of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is a very real possibility in the future because South Australia took a distinct lead in the early days of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and its development in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to give the Senate a few facts about the beginnings of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia’s interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> dates from World War II when  Sir Marcus  Oliphant, the present Governor of South Australia, advised the United Kingdom Government to spend funds on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration in South Australia, where the only deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> then known in Australia were located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results led to the establishment of the Radium Hill mining project in 1954, producing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide yellow cake from the United States-United Kingdom combined development agency over a period of 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The efforts of the South Australian Government encouraged the search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concurrent active participation in the search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the Commonwealth Government resulted in the establishment of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these early <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts terminated about 1964 as a result of stockpile sufficiency and lower cost supplies being available chiefly from Canada in respect of the United States and United Kingdom markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notable in this era was the South Australian Government’s establishment of the research laboratories, now called the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories, which became the recognised authority for the investigation and design of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction processes which were incorporated in all the early <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we in Australia and particularly in South Australia have an early history of initiation and honorable development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discovery and its development to the marketable stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is possible environmentally and for other physical reasons to have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia, South Australia would certainly like to share in its development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would assume that the Government might say that there will not be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with its Party platform, on the basis of which it was elected to office in 1972 and reconfirmed in that office last May, the Labor Government lays great emphasis on the need to approach the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in an orderly and coherent manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far are we to view its development in relation to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other precedents around the world illustrating to the industry that something is expected of it in relation to Australia’s future needs for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must scan what other countries have done in their national interest in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development and must suggest methods whereby the industries in Australia can be involved in a viable, economic mining enterprise and still work within the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it is totally unnecessary in the case of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry- as in the case of many other mineral and petroleum industries- that in order to have proper measures of control, with which none of us would disagree, it should be suggested somewhat sinisterly that controls and ownership are synonymous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that in order properly to control the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> availability and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in this country it is necessary to literally own it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the situation we find today when many companies, particularly in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area, are unable to operate from a research and developmental point of view and unable to continue drilling in this extremely important exploit area, purely because they have no licence through regulations which are part of the Atomic Energy Act and which are related to security situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at this time the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has probably never been higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is such that we have a sellers market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Back in the 1950s it was a sellers market in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the world price was high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the exploration that is required, because of the investigations in the field of atomic energy, because of the technical developments and because of the development of breeder reactors, it is fairly well and fairly certainly recognised that the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will exist for a relatively short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, there is more reason for our using our capacity to develop our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a high price for the product, we could find ourselves in a situation where many <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits suddenly became economic areas of exploitation, deposits which at many other times certainly would not be economic to exploit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uncertainty which has developed in the mining industry, particularly in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, because of this indecisive situation is unfortunately quite widespread in the Australian community today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be some sort of concern on the part of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  that Australia should do nothing about this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> situation prior to the establishment of an enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that in Japan and the United States of America, the chief markets for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> of which we have such great supplies, there is an extremely cool attitude towards Australia exporting the enriched product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is ample power of control in this country without denying companies the right to research and develop areas which can be developed as part of this important <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to four of our policy points which relate to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that without these regulations the Commonwealth Government has already ample powers to ensure the national interest in the exploration, conservation and orderly development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  to tell us where we can find speelled out the energy policy of this Government on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, oil, coal or any other mineral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that without any apology because when we talk about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we know only too well that what happened at Rum Jungle resulted in the excessive pollution of the Finniss River in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went to the area with  Mr Lamb,  a member of the House of Representatives, because I was concerned about uncontrolled <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production and what it can do to the Alligator River system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Minister for Minerals and Energy is that if we have ironclad controls over the Ranger mine there is no justification for any of the other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining ventures going into the Top End National Park in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the prices that we can get for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the open market, it is hard to follow what has been put by Opposition speakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all agree that <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, because of the excessive dangers of the waste and even the secondary waste, must be controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this quite candidly: If we have unused sources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and solar energy comes into being with less destruction of the environment, then I think it is sound policy to develop the latter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate in which we are engaged concerns a motion to disallow certain regulations; but it has ranged over a much wider area, seemingly embracing not only the Government’s policies in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also, as one honourable senator said, our total approach to the world energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would deny the need for the Australian Government to keep complete control in the years ahead of our vital resources, especially <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment about which something was also said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked for information about the Government’s policy in respect of such matters as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will find on page 49 and subsequent pages what the Commission is doing in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> enrichment studies have been carried out by the Commission, in association with others, over the past year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite misleading to suggest that this Government is not fully conscious of the need for proper research and study into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government lays great emphasis on the need to approach the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in an orderly and coherent manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an approach demands a degree of governmental guidance which was lacking prior to December 1972, particularly in the light of the last minute approvals by the former Government of the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at unsatisfactory prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater part of the Australia-wide reserves is contained in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was reinforced in this decision by its determination to ensure that deliveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were made as required under the export contracts, principally with Japan, which were approved by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end holders of approved contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from deposits in the Northern Territory were, earlier this year, offered access to designated deposits owned by the Commonwealth pursuant to section 35 of the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so that Government, through its responsible Minister in each chamber, expressed the belief that it had produced a fair and powerful piece of legislative machinery to shape the future of Australia in this important field of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and atomic energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1953 that Act declared <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and other prescribed substances situated in any territory of the Commonwealth as being the property of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Menzies Government embraced the necessity for a clear enunciation of the Crown’s title to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position then is that no valid ground exists for the seeking of the disallowance of this regulation because it is an essential part of the legislative framework for the development of these <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with his comments about the lack of leadership that has been shown by the Opposition in this area of mineral resources, atomic energy and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising that fact and the fact that we are giving this leadership, I would have hoped that the honourable senator would support the Government in obtaining the necessary powers and ensuring that, in fact, we can exercise the needed control over the export and the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that, of all the mineral and energy resources of this country, no substance would have been of greater importance than our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this debate we have been discussing specifically a lack of policy in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I talk about that, I am talking about a total lack of policy, not only along the lines on which  Senator Hall  spoke, about the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and so on, but a total lack of policy in relation to the whole ambit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining from the exploration stage through to its development and ultimate enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The companies that have over the years of the Liberal Country Party Government gone out and found reserves- very handsome reserves- of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are now facing not only the possiblity that they cannot exploit these reserves in any shape or form but also a very real possibility of the Government taking over some or all of thendeposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister says that the known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are 1 30,000 short tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if the Government reflected on the situation it would see that it is way off beam if that is all it thinks our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves amount to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and if total power over utilisation of resources rests with the Minister and the total ownership rests with the Commonwealth Government, how easy it is simply to hand over the deposits of some companies to this Petroleum and Minerals Authority and allow that Authority to become the sole proprietor of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  is even going to build a treatment plant for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Minerals and Energy has not approached the producers in the latest and most glamorous fuel area, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits of Australia, on any reasonable basis of negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we struggle to find what the energy policy of  Mr Connor  is we learn that apparently he proposes to put a mill in the Northern Territorya government one- and to stack up and stockpile yellow cake <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our duty to provide to the world <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, black coal and other fuels and foods is totally ignored in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will have seen statements recently in which  Mr Connor  talked of handling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To assist him, I point out that the North West Shelf gas project, the Alwest alumina project and the Yeelirrie <span class="highlight">uranium</span> prospect in Western Australia can be included in the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Australian Government underwrite a recent share issue by Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact we are as anti-industry as we are led to believe, why was it that only 3 weeks ago the Government decided to work in conjunction with private enterprise for the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that the Opposition had wrongly pictured  Mr Connor  as wanting to nationalise mining and that he had shown in terms of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that he would go into partnership with free enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the metals and minerals prescribed are no longer in short supply, for example, copper, bauxite, nickel, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the beach sand minerals, and the concession discriminates unfairly in favour of companies mining eligible minerals against those mining minerals not listed for the exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition senators spoke about our Prime Minister castigating the Common Market countries on their attitude to our beef exports and when the Prime Minister negotiated on leader of government basis concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> those honourable senators sneered at and ridiculed him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the no man’s land which exists between  Dr Everingham  and  Mr Clyde  Cameron in relation to the surveillance of industrial safety in the Northern Territory, could we have early clarification of the final guidelines having regard to industrial hazards which could face workers if the Ranger mine commences <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The cost of three <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling plants in the Northern Territory and assistance to the Cooper Basin natural gas consortium, in which the Australian Government is now a partner, was included and also the cost of the plans to economise in diesel fuel consumption, by electrification of the heavy freight rail areas in New South Wales and Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia’s wealth of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources offers vast opportunities for the establishment of an enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that very important area of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Pancontinental was 55 per cent foreign-owned and controlled; and Central Pacific Minerals, 75 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to us that the Commission has an ability to become the buyer and seller of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, wool, wheat, coal or any of the massive bulk commodity mineral products produced in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Experience on the north-west shelf- and in other industries such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- does not at present give companies such confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As evidence of this I give the following examples: We would have abandoned the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration ofthe Australian Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With about two-thirds of its petroleum requirement covered by indigenous crude oil, the direct impact on the Australian economy of the oil price increases has been modest and in the medium and long term Australia stands to benefit from the energy crisis with its abundance of energy resources such as coal, natural gas and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were so lucky that, even when wool and wheat struck trouble, we discovered that our country was a bonanza of minerals: Iron, coal, bauxite, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, copper . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the advances that are being made in the generation of power- such as the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and, no doubt, solar power- if we leave the coal in the ground we might be told in the future to leave it there forever because it is not wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recognising the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development as the virtual custodian of all national parks and fauna reserves in Australian Territories, I ask what guarantee he can give the Senate on the sanctity of the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park in the Top End of the Northern Territory in the face of utterances made by his colleague the Minister for National Resources contending that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction has first priority in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our contribution to the world supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be of the utmost importance as a result of our generous deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today the world is looking towards the Northern Territory providing its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> energy supply from a time as close as the 1980s when the demands for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will reach increased proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was interested to listen to the comments of  Senator Kilgariff  who has just resumed his seat when he was talking of the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can find nowhere on record any statement by the then Opposition that it would sell our interests in our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that the Government has made it quite clear that it is awaiting the findings of the Ranger environmental inquiry before taking a substantive decision in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploitation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the environmental and emotional aspects related to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining- transport, processing, storage of wastes and ultimate long term problems associated with the obsolescence of plants- I place a lower priority on this sort of energy than on others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stated already that in my personal view- this does not reflect the opinion of my Party- <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ought to be used as a bridging source of power to give us a chance to develop other technology which even  Senator Mulvihill  would applaud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The immediate thought that came to my mind was that perhaps his government calls selling our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to foreign investment a legitimate source of fund raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the doubt with respect to radiation hazards associated with the mining and transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and the disposal of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> wastes, together with the problems associated with the accumulation of fissionable plutonium, has the Government any plan to coordinate a program of research into and development of alternative energy sources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there any relationship between this decision and the proposed sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can certainly say that any government approval for the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources will await the findings and the recommendations of the Ranger inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government take seriously the outrageous and hysterical utterances by the Deputy Prime Minister that Australia must exploit and sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to foreign interests or suffer the consequence of having it taken from it by force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Australia has both signed and ratified the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, is not our nation bound by the international obligations inherent in that treaty, which prohibits the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to any nation which has not signed .and ratified the treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government is a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and it may be taken as read that the Government will comply with all its obligations under that treaty in any matters concerning the mining and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all, I tell him, if I may, that on 24 March 1976 the Minister whom he represents in this place stated that 85 per cent local ownership was required in any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, and in a Press release dated 31 March 1976 the Treasurer announced that 70 per cent local ownership would be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister indicate to the Parliament who in fact is the spokesman on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry and which of those 2 statements is correct? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic understanding of the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and other minerals to Japan, especially <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, has been exclusively on the basis that Japan would not sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources: Is he aware that the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources misled the Australian people and the Australian Parliament when he announced recently that other countries would take, by force, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they required from north Australian deposits unless Australia negotiated contracts to sell massive quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that Japan is unlikely to achieve a 25 million kilowatt requirement by 1985; that it has achieved only a 47 per cent capacity factornot the predicted 80 per cent- for its nuclear reactors; and that, in any case, Japan requires only 99 000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to produce the predicted energy requirement of 60 million kilowatts- of which 88 200 tonnes has already been covered by existing contracts from the following sources: France, 8800 tonnes, Australia 5600 tonnes, South Africa 38 200 tonnes, and Canada 35 600 tonnes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government ‘s strict guidelines on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and also the fact that the Ranger inquiry enables all interested bodies to submit evidence in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, will the Minister ask the Prime Minister to seek the support of responsible bodies, such as the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to endeavour speedily to resolve this issue so that an industry which is vital to the nation and to the jobs of” thousands of Australians will not be jeopardised by the actions of a few? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general approach of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has been that all aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining should be the subject of inquiry, and it has seen the Ranger inquiry meeting that requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I gave the general assurance that, overall, the Government has a keen interest in all the environmental impacts on the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but that we would wait for the Ranger report as the Australian Council of Trade Unions will do in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Let me make it clear that the Government certainly would want to do everything it could to remove any jeopardy regarding industrial health, whether it is from carting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or working with sandstone or whether it is a question of silicosis or any of the other pulmonary diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my statement to the House on 25 February 1976 on my visit to Japan, I said that I had confirmed with the Japanese that the joint Australia- Japan <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment study agreed in November 1974 should proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any decisions on the setting up of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry, including matters such as the siting of an enrichment plant, would nave to be based on thoroughgoing studies and the economic and commercial viability of the investment would, of course, have to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) In my speech to the Australian Mining Industry Council on 29 March 1976 1 said that Australia possesses almost a quarter of the Western World’s known <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This estimate is based on the report ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- Resources, Production and Demand’ published jointly by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report estimates Australia’s reserves (reasonably assured resources recoverable at less than $US15/lb U30 ) to be 243 000 tonnes <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or 22.5 per cent of the Western World’s reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s total resources (reasonably assured and estimated additional resources) recoverable at less than $US15/lb U O are estimated in the above report to be 323 000 tonnes <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or 1 5.5 per cent of the Western World’s total <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in this cost category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since publication of the report there have also been some substantial new additions to Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources, notably the announced increase in the size ofthe Jabiluka deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except for Australia and the United States, the estimates for Western World <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources contained in the 1974-75 Annual Report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission are based on an earlier NEA/IAEA report and are, therefore, not comparable to the above estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate who represents the Minister for National Resources, I refer to the proposed visit to Australia by a group of Japanese businessmen to discuss development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and, in particular, the alleged proposal that Japanese nuclear waste should be stored in remote parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves are of world significance, as also is the McArthur River lead /zinc deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Government is that it should not make final policy decisions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development before the Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, presently being conducted under Presiding Commissioner  Mr Justice  Fox, is received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for National Resources recently announced that other countries may take by force the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they require from North Australian deposits unless this country negotiates contracts to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does Japan require only 99 000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to produce the predicted energy of which 88 200 tonnes has already been covered by existing contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the following countries have contracts for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan: (a) France, (b) Australia, (c) South Africa, and (d) Canada; if so, what quantities are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated on 25 February 1976 in a statement on my visit to Japan, the Japanese made it clear to me that their concern is not for immediate supplies since they have already secured the bulk of their requirements of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until 1985; the Japanese desire is to be able to look with confidence to Australia as a major source of supply in the period after 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing ap- p roved contracts for the supply of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to J apan are approximately 7000 tonnes <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry by  Mr Justice  Fox has not yet been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is the statement by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  that he would be happy to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Soviet Union and would accept guarantees by the Soviet Union that it would not be used for nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which does the Government regard as more important- the interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry as expressed by  Mr Anthony  or the alleged threat to Australian security as a whole as expressed by the Prime Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the explosion at the Richland <span class="highlight">uranium</span> plant in the United States on 30 August this year as a result of which several workers were contaminated by radio active waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As someone said: <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> to the Northern Territory and to Australia is what oil is to the Arab states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make this plea to  Senator Kilgariff  because his friends dominate the Northern Territory Legislative Council: If he gets his way and some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is taken from Mary Kathleen, give us this 900 square miles for this park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That there should be no mining or export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in or from Australia (ACF policy would permit the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for medical purposes only, but very limited quantities would be involved). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Look at the promise made about national resources, particularly <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government spoke about the level of Australian equity in <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of Australian equity in Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development required by the Government has changed 3 times, from 80 per cent to 70 per cent to 75 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The events of 11 November were dominated by other things Uke the Strait of Malacca, Timor, the Indian Ocean, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, iron ore and the great sell-out which has been going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the matter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the explosion at the Richland <span class="highlight">uranium</span> plant in the United States on 30 August this year as a result of which several workers were contaminated by radioactive waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the question without notice which you directed to  Senator Guilfoyle,  as the Minister representing me in the Senate, on 8 September 1976, concerning the explosion at the Richland <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Plant in the United States on 30 August 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has given preliminary consideration to the safeguard arrangements which it would apply to exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, policy decisions will have to await the outcome of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first report made public by the Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry it was indicated that, while the green light was given for the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia under certain conditions, the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory could not be commenced until the second part of the report was made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the Government is not at this moment in a position to indicate precisely when the second part of the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry will be made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mindful of the caution shown by  Mr Justice  Fox in his interim report about any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction in the Northern Territory, will the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory exercise the power mentioned by  Senator Carrick  during Estimates Committee discussion to declare the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park before- I emphasise before’- any future <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction is attempted in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that although the commissioners were not required to do so by their terms of reference they pointed out in the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry that they had been asked to suggest where the boundaries of the National Park should be, having in mind proposed and possible mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of my question is to assure myself that we are not undertaking any studies which may facilitate a decision for the establishment of some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project which may be contrary even to the present Government’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was not the plant at Evandale, Port Pirie, built for the purpose of treating <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Radium Hill to supply the requirements of the United States and the United Kingdom Combined Development Agency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a source of energy is currently unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia is internationally irresponsible and is not, in the long term, of benefit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia discourages importing countries from investing research and development funds in finding viable alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world ‘s energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security: In view of the serious concern being expressed over the possible dangers to people who have been in the area of the exposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> tailings dump in Port Pirie, is the Minister now able to say whether the matter is a State or Commonwealth responsibility? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is similar to that asked by  Senator Jessop  about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter related to the Richland <span class="highlight">uranium</span> plant explosion on 30 August 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is probably like a major supporting bout before the big match, which will involve <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore while the Government wishes to ensure the Senate deals principally with this legislative program I assure honourable senators that the Senate will be given an opportunity to debate the Fox report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the reason may be, it is quite evident that, if we are to have additional debates on White Papers, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and so on, we will be here until Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him whether he has seen Press reports that the South Australian Premier,  Mr Dunstan,  is keen to have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant established at Redcliff in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has  Mr Dunstan  had any discussions with the Federal Government on the possible establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My attention has not been drawn to recent reports concerning the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant at Redcliff in South Australia, but in June of this year the matter did receive some Press comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The study being undertaken by the South Australian Government of the feasibility of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry being established in the State is quite consistent with the Commonwealth ‘s view that the feasibility of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment should be fully explored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of its constiutional powers and its responsibilities under the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, any question relating to the establishment of  <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plants in Australia is a matter for the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that the South Australian Government has now completed a preliminary study of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant at Redcliff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the Minister thinks he is being generous in saying that either an afternoon or an evening- not an afternoon and an evening- will be devoted to debating the nationally important question of the future of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Fox report on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry indicated that there ought to be a wide-ranging public discussion on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, civil proceedings claiming treble damages- which could be of the order of some $7 billion- have been instituted by Westinghouse Electric Corporation against 29 United States and foreign <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers including 4 Australian companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, proceedings have been instituted against the Westinghouse Corporation by 16 United States utilities in respect of the non-supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under contracts entered into with Westinghouse, and Westinghouse is resisting those claims on grounds that involve allegations of contraventions by the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers of the antitrust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill is not confined to documents or evidence relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but the legislation will be available to be used whenever the need for it may arise in other contexts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the current United States proceedings relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are concerned, I can inform the Senate that the Attorney-General is satisfied there is a need to make orders under the proposed legislation and he will be taking action in this regard as soon as the legislation has been passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia discourages importing countries from investing research and development funds in finding viable alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved third world will increase yet further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the securing of land rights by Australian Aborigines, promised by successive governments, is prejudiced by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world ‘s energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these reports are true, will the Government deem the entire Alligator River system off limits to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction and regard the area as being suitable for acceptance as part of the world heritage under the Convention for the Protection of World Culture and Natural Heritage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable senator that the Government intends to await the second report of the Commission before it formulates any further policy or takes any further decision in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is just as urgent for the canning fruit growers of South Australia, in my view, as was that matter which was to protect some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to canvass the Fox report, as the Minister would appreciate, but I do point out that a lot of this land is not within the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence that the presence of decay products arising from the emanation of radon from properly managed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mill tailings poses a significant health risk to individuals living today or in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that even if this Government or the 2 major parties together agreed that there would be no export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia and that our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would not be used for nuclear industry this progress would go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that for quite some time many of us in this Parliament have thought that Australia would be in a unique position in the world because of our supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that because of that we might be able to exert an influence on others to try to arrest this possible mad race to destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of great regret that the Government decided in a short space of time to take an attitude on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, as a result of that decision, has also been compelled to take a stand on one particular aspect of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue, namely the fulfilment of the contracts entered into by the previous Government before 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that any person would argue that under no circumstances should our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> be developed for a nuclear industry and exported but, at the same time, it is perfectly clear to all of us, and the Fox report makes it clear, that there are as yet unsolved problems with the disposal of waste, plutonium, accidents, war, terrorism and all the rest of the dangers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But nowhere in the Fox report can I find a definitive statement where  Mr Justice  Fox says straight out that there is justification to go ahead now with the mining and export of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have no alternative but to go ahead and look for further energy sources, and in that regard perhaps I could quote from the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in which  Mr Justice  Fox deals with nuclear energy and alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has some 25 per cent of the known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But most countries have <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is there in the mountains, in the rocks and in the sea, and most countries can produce <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us discount the idea that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be withheld from these countries, because all countries can get it if they want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No sales of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should take place to any country not party to the NPT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  as recently as 12 August this year when in London stated that we will be selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> only to those countries which are members of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to those countries which are agreeing to the international safeguards, and that we will be wanting to draw up bilateral trade agreements with countries to ensure that all of those requirements are met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are careful, cautious and responsible in the way in which we sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to those countries which need extra energy resources and if those countries stand by their commitment I, as one senator in this place, say that we should export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The decision on where, when and whether to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia and where we will go with nuclear technology in Australia is one of the most difficult decisions and difficult problems that this Parliament will have to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally do not take either of the extremist views on nuclear technology and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that are about in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the argument that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> means money, therefore we should rip it out of the ground and export it-rip it out and flog it off- is nonsense and immoral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is more important is that we can have a conservation of energy policy and we can have a national energy policy, which is recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- by the Fox inquiry- in recommendations 12 and 14 and which no one in this country seems to like to quote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would regret it if the arguments about the export of a few thousand tonnes from Mary Kathleen, which will make no difference to the world ‘s attitude to nuclear power and which will make no difference to the supplies which go to Japan, West Germany and the United States, should become the basis of the very real argument which  Mr Justice  Fox and the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry have brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is right that there should be public concern over whether we should mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of opposition to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been generated in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of it, of course, has been well considered, and sincere people with a knowledge of the subject have supported the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> argument; but I am afraid that many of the arguments that have been put have come from people who have not considered the facts and whose aim is to stop the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at any cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 types of people who are pouring out unsubstantiated propoganda and who are determined to stop the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has been a subject that has cropped up during the whole period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been my object, the same as other members of the Committee, to inform myself as much as possible of the arguments for and against in this great debate on whether we should mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that after listening to all the evidence it has not been difficult for me to come to a decision that we should mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that we should export it, provided that necessary and absolute safeguards that are known today are insisted upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another proviso, as  Senator Young  has said and as  Mr Anthony  already has indicated, is that only those countries which are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty should receive our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we leave our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground or export it will not make much difference, because the terrorists will be able to get hold of the supplies scattered around the world at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to make a decision fairly shortly, because of the requirements of countries using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, yellowcake, from about 1982 onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we are prepared to fill the gap created by new power stations coming into operation between 1982 and 1985, someone else will supply the required <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at the economic situation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the rate at which we will be able to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and at the projected rate to which world requirements will increase, we will be able to supply something like $3,000m of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we compare the projected figure for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports with $800m for wool exports and about $500m for beef exports, we can see their enormous potential for the welfare of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we come to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining it is a totally different matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been assessed that under present conditions we could mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia at about $6 per lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers that the world market price at the moment on long-range contracts is something like $30-odd per lb and the spot market price at the present time is something over $40 per lb, the profitability in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that over 50 per cent of proven <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in Australia is Australian owned and a little less than the remaining 50 per cent of the deposits involves at least 75 per cent Australian equity as required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining in Australia is not something that will provide great fortunes for people overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a national point of view it is absolutely essential, I believe, that we get involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been lots of arguments put forward against the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining was carried out in Australia from 1954 to 1971 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People say it is that dangerous, but <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining was carried on from 1954 to 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining be any less safe now than it was then? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was not any great hue and cry when all that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined in those 1 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is being mined on increasing scale in the U.S.A., Canada, South Africa, Niger, France, Gabon, Soviet Union and many other places . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is that we should not have anything to do with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All nations have access to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ores from the ever growing mining industry or from sea-water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking about these people who have made statements that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is so dangerous that we should not have anything to do with it, yet we have been mining it in Australia for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world has been mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and has been using it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to look at this matter from a rational point of view and, as  Senator Young  says, and as most scientists will tell us, there is more danger today from pollution from oil and coal fired power stations than there ever will be from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the pollution from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is one-fifteenth of that from a coal fired power station which produces the same amount of electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country has 20 per cent of the world’s known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I believe there is no question about mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to make sure that the public are satisfied in their own minds that all precautions are being taken and that the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be safely controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might be able to employ some of them if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining gets off the ground and is developed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people opposing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining do not quote this part of the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having weighed all the arguments, there is no question in my mind that we should proceed with the development of our mining interests and we should export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> yellow cake, provided, of course, that every safety precaution is taken, as I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry should further illuminate particular issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That should be related to page 5 of the Fox inquiry report which deals with the whole question of the Northern Territory which is the area in which the big league will be located if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction is to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the ministerial utterances, one sees that there has been an attempt to interpret the first Fox report as presenting an open house, an open slather, as it were, to continue with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My fear is that senior Ministers of this Government will not even wait for the second Fox report, which I am fairly sure will lay down stringent conditions in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction in the Northern Territory which will make such extraction uneconomic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So  Sir Philip  Baxter and his successors are saying: ‘You let us have the power to extract <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Coolong limestone deposit dispute it is thought desirable that the Bureau of Mineral Resources might seek to encourage <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration in more arid regions of the Territory where conservation conflicts would be at a minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say unhesitatingly that I share the fears of the Fox Committee as exemplified on page 5 of its report, namely, that this so-called <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province should be off limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will not worry very much if, as I said, the Fox inquiry says that the Alligator River systemthe entire Northern Territory- be virtually off limits to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I enclose for your information a document headed Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry-Summary of ACF Position’ and dated 10th August, 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Senate allows the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> I do not think the bulk of the Australian population has got any confidence that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission can be trusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  will nod his head and say: ‘Well, that was certainly a proud moment when National Country Party voters eulogised Australian Labor Party senators for standing up to these wicked men who comprise the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining lobby’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the honourable senator should not give us this twaddle about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining taking us into a Garden of Eden situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it was in Idaho or Colorado but some of the Indian tribes who were on a low income scale were involved in an open slather in relation to certain <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have an eminent medico like  Senator Grimes  preaching the gospel of caution, buttressed by the factual evidence I have given, I say that we could well wait a considerable time before developing the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the  Australian Financial Review  said that  Mr Justice  Fox was worried that the first report had been interpreted as providing for an open house on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction and that he had approached the Government to reinforce what I interpreted to be the caution involved, I was told that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining was not on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is a diabolical thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the Atomic Energy Commission despoil the river; yet these are the people who will be the custodians of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will apply the standards if honourable senators allow <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague,  Senator Ruth  Coleman, interjected earlier, it will not be pollution; there needs to be only one disaster m a <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-fired power station and the consequences of that will certainly overshadow the misfortune of the eight or ten coalminers killed in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one mentions the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> most people tend to start talking immediately about nuclear power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox report in essence really concerns itself with whether we ought to be mining and processing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia we have had experience in the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> This dates back to 1944 when the United Kingdom Government and the United States Government suggested that we ought to search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This important mineral was discovered in Radium Hill and Mount Painter in South Australia, Rum Jungle, United <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> and South Alligator in the Northern Territory, and Mary Kathleen in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1954 and 1971 9,200 tonnes of yellow cake, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, was derived from plants at 5 locations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that  Sir Mark  Oliphant, who cannot be classed as inexpert in this field, commented before he left South Australia that there was nothing to fear from the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until the conversion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide to energy that problems arose with respect to pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that anybody in this House who wants to argue for or against the mining and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could find something in the report to prop up his argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My suggestion to the Government is that we ought to be considering in this context the establishment of a marketing authority to ensure that proper provisions are carried out with respect to the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to non-proliferation treaty countries and to countries which are bound to observe the international environmental standards as laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that that should be an appropriate statutory authority, perhaps representative of government departments and private industry, which could work in consultation or collaboration with a permanent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> advisory council, as recommended in the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to revert now to the dangers of radiation and to the effects that might flow from the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burning was attributed to radioactivity, but the truth was that although the child was playing in the vicinity of an old <span class="highlight">uranium</span> dump, which had very little radioactivity in evidence and was simply eliminated by covering it up with a little earth, it proved to be not a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> burn but a burn from the sulphuric acid which had leached into the dam from the nearby Port Pirie acid plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those honourable senators who heard the statements this morning on  AM,  it was interesting to note that the Mary Kathleen miners, who are trade unionists, demonstrated their view that the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ought to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The radioactivity to which these people are subjected in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Mary Kathleen is well below the safe limits laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we start to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> something quite different is sparked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a more appropriate area to be considered, because the Indian study is more significant for the reason that the monazite there, containing sands of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and thorium, exposes large populations to background radiation of over 20 times the normal 100 millirad a year level as measured at Bombay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are of far less consequence than the natural radiation to which we are exposed from day to day, even in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was  Senator Young; Senator Maunsell,  a sheep farmer who would know all about the problems of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>;  Senator Jessop,  an optometrist who would be an expert;  Senator Collard  and  Senator Thomasboth  newcomers to the chamber; and  Senator Scott. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recently published Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental report goes a long way in pointing out the hazards, fears and misunderstandings associated with the nuclear power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have condemned the Government for its hasty, ill-considered and quite blatantly capitalistic approach in reaching a decision on the export and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> before an adequate period of time had elapsed in which to allow extended debate on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many indications in the Fox report that the commissioners considered that their inquiry was to form the basis of a broad public debate on the issues of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the nuclear energy industry, and that the final decision should be taken by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need to review the safety of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuel cycle and despite all the cries by nuclear proponents that it is safe; this has not been demonstrated to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commercial recycling of plutonium and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from reprocessing has not begun, and the economic viability of reprocessing has noi been  demonstrated <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining proponents argue that the ever-increasing energy needs of the world can be satisfied only by <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but the Fox report states on page 3 1 : <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without recycling of fuels, the reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would amount to about 5 per cent of presently estimated fossil fuel reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> reserves are finite and are only postponing the energy crisis for a short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there is a need to continue to debate the subject of the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and a need to look at alternative sources of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proponents for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear power point to the economic advantages of nuclear produced electricity over other energy forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic viability of the nuclear industry has not been adequately demonstrated, especially in view of the non-completion of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuel cycle and the hazards involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence suggests tha: reprocessing may not be a profitable operation  3.1  the average price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which seems likely to apply in future; “and there is, therefore, considerable doubt as to whether it will prove to be commercially attractive government suppport <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> did not increase significantly until the advent of substantially higher oil prices late in 1 973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The downward revisions over the past 2 years in anticipated additions to nuclear capacity have led to reductions in estimated <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to the unproven viability of the world’s nuclear industry, the net benefits to be gained from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia have not yet been sufficiently demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Page 66: Considering all the information available to the Commission on this matter, it appears that estimates of potential Australian sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> up to 19S5; presented by the Australian <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers Forum, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and Pancontinental Mining Ltd, are probably too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A careful reading of the Fox Report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining suggests that some people, including politicians, mining executives and commentators, may have seen in it more than it intended to convey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particular attention to parts of the report in which the commissioners express their own findings, conclusions and recommendations does not justify the view that it recommends that the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should proceed immediately, subject to strict controls . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are simply findings relating to some specific operations in the nuclear cycle, operations that were called into question during the inquiry … A decision by Australia not to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> may or may not decisively influence the course of international events, but the probability is rather that any action taken by Austalia will have some effect even though this cannot be gauged with accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commission, which obviously suffered from internal differences but sought to resolve these by bringing down a single report hedged with all sorts of qualifications, finds that the first two recommendations, which find in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling, have overwhelmed the remaining 14 recommendations, which add up to a litany of reservations as to the virtues of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to popular impression, claims of the Fraser Government, and delights of the miners, the Fox report has not given the ‘all clear sign for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining 1 3 with the body of the report offer an alarming and carefully documented case on the dangers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is indicated in the Government’s already apparent open contempt for the final Fox recommendation which required a public debate about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development before a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lip service may be paid to this concept but if there is one thing the present Federal Government is incapable of doing, it is encouraging a public debate on anything, let alone <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two conclusions did not appear to raise obstacles to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development from the hazards of mining and milling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been accused, however, of ignoring several important reservations concerning the hazards involved with future development of an Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry contained in the body of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox commissioners are further concerned that the Government has used the report to support its stated policy for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: the case against the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the case for delay, and the case for immediate development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government has yet to make a decision on the Northern Territory producers, Government ministers, including  Mr Newman,  have made it clear they consider the first Fox report as giving the green light to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it can be argued that the wording and presentation of the report’s findings and recommendations are open to various interpretations the commissioners are known to be alarmed at the tactics adopted by the Government and proponents of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government yesterday admitted that it had received a letter from Justice Fox of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry criticising the government’s interpretation of its first report, despite denying this in Parliament on Tuesday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was this very Ministerial statement issued by  Mr Newman  on the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry that sparked off a debate in Parliament on Tuesday, with one government backbencher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Item 1 of the report does not appear to raise obstacles to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development from the hazards of mining and milling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining began when I lived adjacent to Mary Kathleen for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has given me an interest in the subject and it has given me an interest in the men who are mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- the Fox Inquiry- look at the fossil fuel problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The life of the present known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is limited if the present type of reactor is used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is a natural element that is found in many coal mines and there is nothing we can do about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The usable <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be taken out of them and 99.5 per cent of the plutonium recovered for re-use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been much talk about the problems of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> has been mined for about 500 years, together with lead and zinc, in Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Urine tests on workers at the Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine have shown definite signs of radiation absorption, according to unions in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did absorb <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but the workers themselves will tell you that it was their own fault through not being clean enough, through not washing their hands before their crib, or through not washing their hands before smoking or rolling a cigarette. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will tell you that it is half their own fault if they have an increased <span class="highlight">uranium</span> count in their urine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is discussing- and I think that would be the context in which we ought to be dealing with this important matter- the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry which means we discuss nuclear energy and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only see this debate as heralding the wider public debate which has been referred to and requested by the Ranger inquiry commissioners and drawing attention of the general public to the importance of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry commissioners themselves have declared: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people are entitled to have the time to read the Fox report and to assess it before Australia is committed to the status of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplier which may well prove to be a status from which future Australians will be unable to extract or will have difficulty in extracting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government has a duty to the Senate to explain why, in view of the final recommendation that ‘there should be ample time for public consideration of this report and for debate upon it’, a decision to go ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certain matters concerning the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue which I believe have to be put forward to correct the erroneous opinion that the whole issue is confined to the safety of workers in the industry, or for that matter the equally important if not more important safety factors which will affect this generation and all future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Australians must be given the opportunity to assess the detrimental and beneficial effects that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is likely to bring to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be denied that some employment opportunities would be obtained if we were to go ahead willy-nilly on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and that some jobs would be retained if the go-ahead were given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new mining development is highly capital intensive compared with the figures for the old Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine which has been employing for the last year 300 men for an annual production of 800 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the rapid expansion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, which is capital intensive, and mining generally, will have indirect detrimental effects on the employment prospects and existing jobs in the other 2 major sectors of our economy- the rural and the manufacturing sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mining, of course, requires- this is particularly so in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining- large amounts of capital, and that capital must be found somewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet  Senator Maunsell  had the audacity to suggest that the $3,000m that we may accrue annually from the extraction and enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be a great thing for the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The desire particularly seems to be, as is evidenced by the immoral speed with which the Fox report was dismissed, to lead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining which, to get off the ground, requires large capital inflows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative argument, which is partly moral and partly economic, has been put by those advocating <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the development of nuclear power, and a nuclear based economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the view that was expressed recently by the National Secretary of the Labor Party, David Combe when he said that he believed that within the next decade the issues of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and mining generally in Australia will be the biggest issues to be faced by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to take the view that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was the answer to the energy problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have examined the relative costs of electricity generated by coal and nuclear energy, particularly in those countries which are said to be critically dependent on Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is precisely what the Fox inquiry seeks to do, namely, to have the Australian people consider and ponder the whole argument and discuss as a community the problems associated with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has honoured an agreement made by the Liberal Party in 1972 regarding the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources by reminding him of statements by members on the Government side during the debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and at other times that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was needed to help solve the energy crisis caused by the ever-decreasing reserves of oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this information which has been supplied by the Minister I ask him how he can justify his Government’s stated policy that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is needed to help overcome the energy crisis, especially as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves will not even outlive oil reserves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government now accept the fact that there is and will continue to be an energy crisis even if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is used, and will he therefore urge the Government immediately to appropriate substantial funds to foster research into alternative energy sources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether that is what the honourable senator is really interested in or whether by his question he is more interested in trying to make an argument that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ought to be left in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of explanation I also say that very high rates of royalty may be imposed on particular minerals- for example, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is like the people who want to dig for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and who bury the waste 2 foot underground and pray to God that nothing will happen about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of information published in the annual report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for 1975-76, western world resources in the reasonably assured category recoverable at up to$US30 per lbU3Og are estimated at 1.84 million tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cumulative <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements in the Western world were estimated in that report at 1.8 million tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> up to the year 1995 on the basis of a low growth scenario. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the extent of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources is constantly being revised as new discoveries are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Do many proponents of nuclear power claim that the level of fatalities and the level of diseases associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will be reduced if mine workers wear heavy protective clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines are in hot arid parts of the world such as Africa, some are located in cool temperate and cold regions such as Canada and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and others are in mountainous regions, for example in the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other areas outside Arnhem Land- good potential areas for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and natural gas- h ow long will it be before the 1 8 existing licences are renewed and more are granted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this forecast assume the implementation of a national program for energy conservation, as recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates concerned were prepared before the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry was established and, therefore, do not take account of any of the findings and recommendations in the First Report of the Inquiry as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By using plutonium bred from <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-238 in present day thermal reactors, which rely on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-235 for their operation, FBRs will generate about 1.1 to 1.3 times more plutonium at each pass of fuel elements through the reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the irradiated fuel is reprocessed, plutonium and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are separated and recycled into new fuel elements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If recycled often enough through FBRs, natural <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can give up about 70 per cent of its stored energy instead of about 1 per cent as in present thermal reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this sense and over a period of time, FBRs will ‘multiply’ the energy available from the original <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-235 by a factor of about 70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The breeding ratio is determined by a number of factors such as the type and physical form of the fuel used, the physical size and shape of the reactor core and its surrounding material, and the distribution of the breeding material (<span class="highlight">uranium</span>-238) in the reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier experiments, projected to a commercial reactor size of above 1000 megawatts electrical output, suggest breeding ratios of about 1.1 to 1.3 using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) What action has the Minister taken to investigate the possible existence and implications of a World ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Club’ as outlined in the article ‘Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Sheiks’, which appeared in  Nation Review  on 17 September 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) and (2) In evidence to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry on 8 April 1976, the Government indicated that there had been discussions between potential producers of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the Department of National Resources on future <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-27">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the measures announced on 11 November 1976 by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Government’s attitude is that policy decisions in relation to the further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will have to await the outcome of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface, may I remind the Minister that the final recommendation of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry’s first report was that no decision be taken in relation to the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until a reasonable time had elapsed and there had been an opportunity for the usual democratic processes to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate of the steps his Government has taken to reach as many people in the community as possible with the facts on all aspects of the mining, milling and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: As the South Australian Government has undertaken studies for the possible establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia, subject to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, can the Minister state what level of discussions have taken place between the Federal Government and the South Australian Government in relation to the establishment of such a plant in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was said in answer to a question from  Senator Young  on 1 7 November 1976, a study has been undertaken by the South Australian Government on the feasibility of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry being established in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present position is that the AAEC has continued to provide technical advice on draft papers prepared by the South Australian Government <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any current study of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment proposal in Australia, of course, must be conducted without prejudice to any future Government policy concerning the possible development of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this debate I shall not enter into the area of whether there ought to be <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Yeelirrie <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits will be of great significance if we decide to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not so long ago the Government of honourable senators opposite found that there was a bit of a problem concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the big American corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining project in production is at Mary Kathleen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This project is 100 per cent owned by Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No decisions have been taken on the development of these projects as the Government’s attitude is that policy decisions in relation to the further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will have to await the outcome of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any decision were taken to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in Australia, any such projects would only be allowed to proceed provided they had a minimum of 75 percent Australian equity and were Australian controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects at Radium Hill and/or Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> production did occur at those localities in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploration for minerals generally is taking place at a number of localities throughout Australia, including those mentioned in the question, and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> may or may not be an object of the exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such projects cannot at this stage be definitely classified as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could even speculate again that that second factor might be offset by exports of natural gas from the northwest shelf or by exports of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can understand the acute embarrassment of the National Country Party as farmers become aware of this fact and as they realise, in particular, that if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports of the magnitude that some people forecast actually materialise- exports worth a billion dollars a year- those adverse pressures will intensify. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The production and export of high value minerals such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could provide additional stimulus to any tendency to balance of payments surplus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface the question by reminding the Minister of an answer he gave to a question asked by my colleague,  Dr Jenkins,  in another place on 10 March 1977 wherein the Minister stated that his Department had established a task force to monitor public debate on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he indicate how and where public debate is being followed by this task force in the light of the restricted printing of the first report of the Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want effective dialogue on the effect on mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and want the arguments for and against its being mined, Ministers have a big responsibility to provide effective answers which may become part of the yeast of the bread for discussion on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After reading the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry First Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am most concerned that your Government have launched into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export without any regard for some of the misgivings voiced by the Fox Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Report (page 148) is also concerned with the possibility of a state, which Australia supplies with <span class="highlight">Uranium</span>, withdrawing from the NPT or IAEA safeguards, or from both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is your Department considering taking up any of these on an international level with other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> suppliers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be necessary for the lay public to have to remind your Department of these shortcomings associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that you did not see fit to intercede with your colleagues to ascertain that some of these loop-holes were eliminated before the Government rushed headlong into flogging <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that his failure to do so and the current emphasis on and argument surrounding the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should not divert our attention from the need to have some long term planning in relation to the development and usage of the limited petroleum resources that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I just say to these honourable senators who are so concerned that I hope they are just as concerned about their children’s children when the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> comes up for debate in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we must all recognise that although we have a very strong economic tie with Japan we are not to be told by the Japanese whether, for example, we will export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that this will be a subject of some interest over the next few days as, I understand, a group of Japanese will be coming here to assess our capacity to export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly not for Japan or any other country to tell us whether we will or will not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will make that decision and I hope that the Government will not be pressured by the Japanese Government or by Japanese business interests on such a fundamentally important issue as the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>what is going to happen to the balance of payments, how much will the mineral discoveries increase the wealth of Australia, what are the real costs of adjustments (perhaps industries adjust easily) and finally what is ones moral view on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peko-Ez told me they sought legal advice for two reasons, the first because of the continued uncertainty surrounding development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources exacerbated by the uncertain outcome of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, and, secondly because of the delay in reaching agreement with the Government on the terms of stockpile borrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the first point, it is well known that the Government’s attitude is that final decisions on the further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will have to await the outcome of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the Government’s attitude to the approved export contracts, I repeat what I said in my statement to the Parliament on 25 February 1976, namely, that the Government would wish to see honoured those contracts for supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> entered into prior to December 1972 and confirmed by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it  Senator Kilgariff  is interested in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because some of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, or all the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, are in the Territory which he represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Has the Minister noted the statement by  Mr Dunstan,  Premier of South Australia, that his Government is now opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that not long ago the State Government was most anxious to establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister indicate the extent of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in that State and whether the development of such deposits will contribute to the State’s economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most dangerous aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export was the disposal of nuclear waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it correct that no nuclear wastes are produced as a result of the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this statement not conflict with the conclusion of the Fox committee that there are no environmental problems associated with the processing and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provided that proper management techniques are observed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by my colleague the  Deputy  Prime Minister, in the other place, that he has noticed Press reports today stating that  Mr Dunstan  announced yesterday that South Australia will not allow the mining and enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Australia and that  Mr Dunstan  opposes <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that  Mr Dunstan,  like his Federal leader, is taking decisions before the debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which is presently under way, is completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action by  Mr Dunstan  and his party is nothing more than a cynical attempt to pre-empt the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate presently under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some considerable time  Mr Dunstan  has been studying the feasibility of establishing a major <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Premier,  Mr Dunstan,  forwarded to the  Deputy  Prime Minister a copy of a report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment prepared by the South Australian Government which has clearly favoured <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment and has, to date, been working strenuously towards the development, exploitation and enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  was quoted under banner headlines in the Press of 2 July last year as stating that he strongly favoured the early construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia at a cost of $ 1,400m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan caught other Premiers hopelessly napping on Wednesday when I released a 2 year feasibility study for a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment complex at Redcliff, near Port Augusta, which would double the value of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports from 500 million to 1000 million from present prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extraordinary reversal by  Mr Dunstan  is only another cynical illustration of Labor’s intention to preempt public debate on the Fox report and to prevent the Australian public from having the opportunity to take a balanced and considered view of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some weeks ago I asked the Minister what steps the Government had taken to put into effect the recommendation of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry that there be broad public discussion of the matters raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that, as when I checked on Tuesday of this week, the Government’s bookshop in Melbourne was out of stock of the report, as there is only one Government bookshop in Victoria, as it is reported to me that many public libraries and libraries such as the Baillieu Library in Melbourne have no copies of the report and as its costs $4.50 a copy, will the Minister be amenable to asking Commissioner Fox to suggest groupings of people to prepare ‘pro’ and ami’ cases on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and have that material circulated with the referendum proposals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Does the First Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry recommend that a national energy policy should be developed and reviewed regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many people are likely to be employed directly in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and associated industries if all major Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines were to be brought into production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this figure likely to increase with the increased enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The precise relationship between the accumulated exposure to concentrations of radon released from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling and deaths due to lung cancer (the disease most likely to be associated with inhalation of radon gas) is uncertain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From available scientific data produced by recognised authorities like the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the concentration of radon in the atmosphere will be increased by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production, by about one ten-thousandth of the concentration of radon naturally occurring in the atmosphere, due to its natural release from the earth ‘s surface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the contrary a number of reports have been produced in recent years, including the 1972 Report to the UN General Assembly on the ‘Effects of Atomic Radiation’; the 1976 OECD Nuclear Energy Agency Report on ‘Estimated Population Exposure from Nuclear Power Production and Other Radiation Sources’; the 1973 Report of the United States Environmental Protection Agency on ‘Environmental Analysis of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Fuel Cycle’; and the United Kingdom Royal Commission on ‘Environmental Pollution on Nuclear Power and the Environment’; all of which give objective and comprehensive assessments of the environmental and health impact of the nuclear power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Foreign Investment in <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) In the light of recent statements by the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies as to the great economic benefits Australia could achieve if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits were exploited, is it a fact that overseas ownership of Pancontinental amounts to at least 49 per cent and that there is substantial overseas ownership in other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ventures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, under the present equity arrangements, be of as great a financial benefit to Australia as the mining companies claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) to (4) As announced by my colleague the Treasurer in his statement of 1 April 1976 to the Parliament on foreign investment in Australia, a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project involving investment by foreign interests, not already in production, will only be allowed to proceed provided it has a minimum of 75 per cent Australian equity and is Australian controlled at the time production commences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As indicated in the statement by the Treasurer and myself of 28 May 1976, individual portfolio share-holdings of less than 10 per cent in an Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> company would be disregarded unless there were special circumstances that would need to be taken into consideration in a particular case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, it is necessary for companies proposing to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects to demonstrate to the Government that their proposals meet the guidelines, as outlined above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Fox Inquiry state that ‘the downward revision over the past two years in anticipated additions to nuclear capacity have led to reductions in estimated <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is the oversupply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> likely to depress the market price of U3O8 If so, will this make the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> less economic in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, would such price reductions further erode the viability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) and (2 ) If a world oversupply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is allowed to develop, prices could be lower than may have otherwise been anticipated thereby possibly making the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> less profitable than may have otherwise been anticipated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry does take place, the Government has indicated in evidence presented to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry on 8 April 1976 that it intends to ensure that there is orderly development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and that an oversupply situation, with consequential reduction in world prices to Australia’s disadvantage, is avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What decisions have been made since 10 December 1 976 in relation to a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Marketing Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are discussions continuing on the basis of a go-ahead on new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1459 on 10 December 1976 my colleague, the Acting Minister for National Resources, indicated that exploratory discussions had been held with potential <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers on future <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many copies of (a) the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry; (b) the report of the Inquiry into Australian Broadcasting; and (c) the Green Paper on Immigration Policies and Australia’s Population, were made available for distribution respectively to (i) members and senators; (ii) the Australian Government Publishing Service for sale to the general public; (iii) public libraries throughout Australia; and (iv) libraries of universities and other tertiary education institutions throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-86">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister write to the Minister for National Resources indicating his concern that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory would be obstructed by the possible national park boundaries and Aboriginal land rights claims? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask: If the letter indicates that the Minister is advocating that the Federal Government break its election promises on the environment and on Aboriginal affairs in order to push ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory, does not this pre-empt any recommendations which may be made by the second report of the Fox inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of the Committee’s inquiry the ongoing arguments over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the development of nuclear power have resulted in solar power being promoted by anti-nuclear proponents and others as a readily available energy alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times both the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and the Royal Commission on Petroleum have commented on the lack of any recognisable energy policy in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  President  is well aware of the rich deposits of copper ore and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the vicinity of Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Administrative Services and refer to questions that I asked him last week concerning the printing and distribution of the second part of the Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because today is the last day of sitting of the Parliament for at least a fortnight, is it intended by the Government to have the second part of the Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report issued while the Parliament is in recess? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are issues of major international importance in their own right, but they have an added significance for Australia because of our potential as a supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will remain the case whether or not Australia is ultimately to become a major exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The safeguards policy which we will follow is, in our view, appropriate for any country to follow whether it be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplier or consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government fully accepts that if it were in future to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export from Australia, this would carry with it added responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against the background of these international responsibilities the Government accepts that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a special commodity, the export of which would involve important considerations of a kind not involved in the export of other commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We view adequate safeguards as a fundamental prerequisite of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export which we would also expect responsible customer countries for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> readily to accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that, following the release of the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government announced in the House on 1 1 November 1 976 that it supported the Inquiry’s view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement of a policy at this stage, of course, in no way pre-empts a decision on the question whether any such new contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government has repeatedly emphasised, this remains a matter for consideration following receipt of the final report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Government has taken certain decisions on safeguards policy at this stage reflects its determination to ensure that an established frame-work of policy exists so that any new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports take place under the most carefully considered and responsible conditions possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wishes to avoid a situation in which decisions may be required on new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing at some point in the future without the benefit of a clear policy on the ground rules to apply so far as safeguards are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a potentially significant supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries and other nuclear supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied nuclear material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These cover: The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, should the Government approve further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry it will retain the right to be selective in the countries to whom <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export will be permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following minimum criteria for eligibility to receive Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government emphasises that these represent minimum conditions for countries to be eligible to receive Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect the Government’s policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Third, the Government wishes to ensure that if a decision is taken to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it will be the Government’s policy that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be such that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be in a form which attracts full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth, Australia will require the prior conclusion of bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and countries wishing to import Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under any future contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These bilateral agreements will provide a framework for direct and binding assurances by importing countries to the Australian Government in relation to the use and control of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia or nuclear material derived from its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia would seek to arrange with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries regular expertlevel consultations to satisfy ourselves of the implementation of the provisions of bilateral agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with the positions taken by the United States and Canada Australia would retain the right to cease supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to any country which breached safeguards undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already made clear that Australia would not be prepared to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to such countries in the absence of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards applied under the NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia to one country, or nuclear material derived from its use, to be able to be reexported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries should make any transfer of supplied material to a third party contingent on the prior consent of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision will give Australia the means of ensuring that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we supply or nuclear material derived from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventh, we would require that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied to other countries for peaceful uses not be enriched beyond 20 per cent <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-235 without prior Australian consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of this requirement also, the Government’s policy extends beyond the recommendations made by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to effectively reserve Australia’s position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that any reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This requirement is additional to those recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report and reflects similar concerns to those expressed by the Inquiry in relation to reprocessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries that adequate physical security will be maintained on their nuclear industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These requirements also translate into concrete policy measures concerns expressed by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, although the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report did not make a recommendation on this matter, the Government has decided that it is desirable that, as a standard practice, a clause should be included in any future contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia noting that the transaction is subject to safeguards as agreed between the importing country and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It builds on the preliminary thinking of the Government described in testimony to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry last year, as well as the recommendations of the first report of the Inquiry itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importers and major nuclear exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International Atomic Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the Government is satisfied that the policy it has decided upon represents a practical, reasonable and effective package of safeguards measures to seek from countries wishing to import <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia under any future contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that particularly in view of the fact that in the vicinity of Roxby Downs, which is not far from Woomera, there are quite considerable deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and copper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>906 with his recent statements concerning Australia’s moral obligation to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to an energy starved world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one other matter I want to raise and that is the matter of the tabling of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Second Report in the Parliament today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of vital importance to the whole community that sufficient copies of this Second Report are available to the general public so that they can purchase them, see what is contained in the report and inform themselves fully as to the ramifications or otherwise of the mining and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) In the light of the Government’s stated policy that it will encourage widespread public debate on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining issue, will the Minister make public the recent court decision in West Germany which ordered the cancellation of planning permission for a nuclear power station at Whyl in West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-52-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second half of 1977. relations between the Federal Government and the trade unions will be sorely tested by four issues; <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, wage indexation, the federal Government’s industrial legislation, and the establishment of an Omega navigation station in Gippsland, Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Minister write to the Minister for National Resources indicating his concern that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory would be obstructed by the possible national park boundaries and Aboriginal land right claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this letter indicate that the Minister is advocating that the Federal Government break its election promises on the environment and Aboriginal affairs in order to push ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) A letter was written to the Minister for National Resources on 14 April drawing his attention to the possibility that the final report to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environment Inquiry may recommend a substantial variation of the boundaries of the proposed Kakadu National Park to those contained in a gazettal notice in May 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question by reminding the Leader of the Government in the Senate that last week he indicated that he would endeavour to set aside sufficient time this week for debate to take place on the nuclear safeguards statement and on the Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry second report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government taking direct control of the mining and export of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves (nationalisation). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At what stage are discussions between the Minister for the Northern Territory,  Mr Adermann,  and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  as to the ultimate boundaries of the Kakadu National Park, bearing in mind utterances by senior Ministers to the effect that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction is due to start? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Mulvihill will know that the study of Kakadu as a national park is bound up with the overall study of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> impact inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How much <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been exported from Mary Kathleen since the Government decision to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fulfilling the contracts has any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore been exported from other sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What was the destination of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and in each case what was the amount sent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Approximately 565 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide were exported from Mary Kathleen up to 3 1 May 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was exported from other Australian sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Road transport was used to move the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Mary Kathleen to Mount Isa on 17 December 1976, 28 February to 8 March 1977, 6 April and 29 April 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> was loaded on ships at Brisbane on 12 January, 23 to 24 March and 8 May 1977, and at Townsville on 9 April 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two shipments of 52 and 10 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide were exported to the United Kingdom for final use by a West German electric power utility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder went to the United Kingdom to replace <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide borrowed from the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority by Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science: Is it true that the first Fox report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> stated that ‘all reasonable practical steps should be taken to limit reliance on nuclear energy’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that on 3 February 1976 the Government announced its intention to sell its 41.6 per cent interest in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the three days of discussions, the Philippines and Japan both raised the subject of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both stressed the importance of nuclear power to meet their future energy needs and expressed the hope that Australia would be a future supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the need to protect the health of those engaged in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry and my Department has been involved in the production of the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Code of Practice was accepted as an authoritative document by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Enquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Is the Minister aware of statements made in the Fox Report which indicated that total world demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> up to 1985 has been revised downwards over the past two years to approximately from 40 1 000 to 476 000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister read recent statements by Pancontinental Mining Ltd which indicate that world demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> between 1980 and 1985 will be sufficient to enable known Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits to be developed simultaneously at their planned production rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Estimates of future requirements for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as for any other mineral, undergo constant revision reflecting reassessment of the world economic situation as well as aspects related to a particular mineral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Does the Minister recall statements he made last year concerning the need for Australia to sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan or else they might come and take it by force ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen the statement by the Japanese Ambassador to Australia,  Mr Okawara,  which indicated that Japan does not vitally depend on Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for its energy needs and could, in fact, get all its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies from South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does this statement influence the often stated case by pro-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners that Australia has to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to help such energy hungry countries as Japan overcome their energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) to (4) I have not said that there is a need for Australia to sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan or else they might come and take it by force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This debate is on the Second Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, commonly referred to as the Fox Inquiry, and also on the ministerial statement brought down by the Government on 24 May headed ‘Nuclear Safeguards- Government Policy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the first time that a full debate has been held in the Senate on the vexatious and controversial question of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being held at a time before the Government has announced its policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia and after two reports of the Fox Commission have been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are particularly concerned that at least one scientist has expressed his belief that the vast inland of this nation could well be used as a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste product disposal area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact alone, perhaps more than anything, should indicate to Australians and to this Parliament the seriousness of the matter we are discussing, namely, whether with all the hazards that exist so far as the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a source of power is concerned, we as a nation should proceed at this time and in these circumstances with mining of the yellowcake and its export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recognising that the provision of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the rights and well being of the Aboriginal people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Believing that (having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental, and technical problems associated with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the development of nuclear power, and in particular to the proven contribution of the nuclear power industry to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased risk of nuclear war; and the absence of procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes to ensure that any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the environment is eliminated), <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is imperative that no commitment of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits to the world’s nuclear fuel cycle should be made until- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government endorses recommendation 6 of the First Fox Report which states: ‘A decision to mine and sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should not be made unless the Commonwealth Government ensures that the Commonwealth can at any time . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>not permit the mining, processing or export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> pursuant to agreements entered into contrary to Labor’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the Whitlam Labor Government which commissioned the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry because we have thought about energy resources and alternatives to oil and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> processing, leaving the world as it does with a product, plutonium, that has a half life of 25 000 years, needs detailed thought and consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, at the Perth conference the Labor Party announced its decision to hold a moratorium on new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed it appears obvious that since the last visit by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to Europe and the United States of America <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be used as a carrot, waved in front of other nations in order to obtain markets, particularly in the European Economic Community countries and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that is no way to consider seriously the important implications for Australia, and indeed for the world, of the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hawking of potential future <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts all over the world makes the Government’s policy on nuclear safeguards- one of the papers that we are now debating which was presented on 24 May last- look suspicious and somewhat ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major points in the safeguards policy outlined to the Parliament on 24 May by the Prime Minister is: ‘Careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  himself seemed very keen to insinuate future deals with France, a non signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, when he was in that country, and of course  Mr Anthony  mentioned in glowing terms just prior to the recent Association of South East Asian Nations talks the desire of the Philippines for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stiff opposition Prime Minister Fraser is meeting in his tour of Europe to Australia ‘s nuclear safeguards policy is creating an embarrassing dilemma for the Government on the eve of its final go-ahead announcement for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Points where potentially useful reduction in present and future exposures are being or could be made with present technology were identified as whole body exposures of workers in the industry radiation doses to the lungs of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners in due course, the collective world population dose from releases to the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These releases may occur at such places as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, nuclear power stations, fuel processing plants or research organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian electorate has shown in a Morgan gallup poll conducted in July 1977 that those in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia are now in the minority- 47 per cent, which is a drop of 30 per cent in the last few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party appreciates this opportunity to outline its fears for the future so far as the mining and export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is concerned, given the unknown hazards that lie ahead, the doubt and the uncertainty that are before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor movement believes that it would be quite irresponsible, without all the inherent dangers being properly faced up to and all the critical questions being satisfactorily answered, to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first deals with the general aspects of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the usage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and the second deals primarily- I emphasise ‘primarily’- with the environmental aspects of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in relation to the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also taken note of the fact that part of the decision reached at the recent federal conference of that party was that it will repudiate any commitment of a non-Labor government to the mining, processing or export of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two directors will be appointed to Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd by the AAEC - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this recent conference of the Labor Party resolved that the Party will repudiate any commitment of a non-Labor government to the mining, processing or export of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam  warned that the move could force the cancellation of contracts for the sale overseas of enriched Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and yellow cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A contract had already been completed for the sale of yellow cake to Japan and his Government was negotiating for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Comment was passed about the possibility of the Australian Government having dealings with France for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As recently as February of this year in answer to questions in this place the relevant Minister has said that the State Labor Government in South Australia was still having discussions with departments in Canberra with respect to a feasibility study for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is having discussions with the Western Mining Corporation with regard to a possible big mine in South Australia for copper mixed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is mined there, this on a value basis would be the equivalent of some 6 per cent of copper, which is a very good mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the financial return drops considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Premier of South Australia saw fit to second a motion at the federal conference of the Australian Labor Party in Perth last month proposing an indefinite moratorium in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when he is still encouraging finance for exploration in South Australia centered on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and copper and is still pressing ahead with a feasibility study concerned with a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I think the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue in South Australia is an exercise similar to the Chowilla Dam election issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge the Premier of South Australia to stand up and to state publicly why he is continuing to press ahead for a feasibility study concerning a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia when he believes and stands by the fact that in the next two or three years he will not support the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland quoted gallup poll figures today which show that support for the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is down to 47 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is fearful of losing the support of people who may be opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear all sorts of arguments with regard to the pros and cons of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can be told of all sorts of policies, such as we have been given today by  Senator Douglas  McClelland who claimed that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what the Labor Party’s policy is or what our policy is, we will not discourage countries from trying to obtain <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or going nuclear because today we are living in the age of the nuclear reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for the Australian Labor Party to say that if Australia does not sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it will have an effect in so many ways on the world situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that if Australia does not sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> its action will have an effect, but I believe that that effect will be quite the reverse of what the Labor Party claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the countries which are turning to nuclear energy want is a reliable source of supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not get a reliable source of supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, they will face not just an energy gap but a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> gap which, in turn, will encourage fast breeders and plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present Australia has 20 per cent of the known world reserves of cheap <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a moral responsibility to the world and especially to those countries which wish to buy our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under certain guidelines and conditions with which I will deal later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, we will encourage a plutonium economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us press on and support the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to selected markets while still being responsible and avoiding the encouragement of fast breeder development throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard a great deal said about coal as an alternative to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One pound of coal equals some 12 SOO British thermal units and one pound of ordinary <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is equal to 250 000 000 British thermal units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it another way: In volume, a pound of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is equal to some 20 000 pounds of coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When comparing a coal fired thermal generator with a nuclear generator of the same capacity, let us remember that there are 1 1 times more deaths in the coal industry than in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had Japanese trade unionists in Australia appealing to unionists in this country to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because they know what the needs are in Japan and they are concerned about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had many people from Europe appealing to Australia on this matter because we have 20 per cent of the world’s known reserves of cheap <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and we would be a reliable source of supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that the Japanese want our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not we sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, enough countries today- some 46 countries have gone nuclear- could create dangers of proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a coastal state wishes to build an atomic bomb all it has to do is use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in sea water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the country which wishes to build an atomic bomb has shale rocks it has any quantity of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a country has the necessary ability it has a source of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest problem the world is facing with regard to filling the energy gap by nuclear reactors, as I said, is the fear of a shortage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President  Carter was not successful for the simple reason that countries themselves expressed concern that there would be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> gap and as such there was a need for them to turn to fast breeders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does it use a lesser amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also in the process of operation it virtually creates plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, because of the concern at the possible lack of supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, many countries are still pressing ahead with research into the establishment of fast breeders and also with regard to reprocessing to get plutonium to use in those fast breeders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned earlier that I feel that we as a nation should export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I interpret the second Fox report as a green light to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report stated that the social and cultural implications for Aboriginals of mining in the area was one of the most important elements to be considered in the decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I support the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> I also support the need for a thorough inquiry and discussion by the Government and those concerned to make sure that the socioeconomic well-being of the Aboriginals as well as the environment will be given serious consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we mine and export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we will have the opportunity as one of the major suppliers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to enforce our safeguards and guidelines overall because we can work in with other major suppliers such as Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation will be entirely different if we do not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to a world that has decided itself that it is living in a nuclear reactor age, a world that wants our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and a world which, if it cannot get our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, will continue to move rapidly towards the establishment of fast breeders with the consequent plutonium era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, it is our responsibility to mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> responsibly under the guidelines as propounded by the Prime Minister to many of those countries that have committed themselves to a nuclear age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we reflect the changing views of the community when it comes to the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken to heart the call of the first Fox report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry which, as  Senator Douglas  McClelland reminded the Senate, recommended that no decision on the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> be taken until a reasonable time had elapsed and there had been an opportunity for the usual democratic processes to function,  including  in this respect parliamentary debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of what we now know about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, we feel that our policy is in line with both public awareness and what the public wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what the first Ranger report said on the matter of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it had to be noted that when the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was in Europe in May and June obviously he was selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand Australia has no intention of sitting on its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From other remarks in other European newspapers it was obvious that our Prime Minister was trotting around Europe assuring all and sundry that we would sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> so long as the price was right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This week the Melbourne  Herald  carried the headline ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining: Government All Clear’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has decided to authorise the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as I have been able to find out, there has been no denial by the Government that it has agreed to the sale, mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government obviously agreed to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it should have remembered that the first recommendation of the second Fox report was: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that sort of report from the Fox inquiry, despite the fact that the newspapers are saying that the Government has agreed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and despite the fact that the Victorian Government has reported that it proposed a 1000 megawatt nuclear station for Victoria by 1995, we have yet had no report from the Government on any sort of legislation that would safeguard Australians or, for that matter, the world from what the consequences of all that might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just heard key Government Ministers saying: ‘Of course we will mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only safeguards that have been handed down are the safeguards that deal with what might happen to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when it is exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are dangers to miners in Australia, although our mines will be open cut rather than deep mines, and although it is acknowledged that in deep cut mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in America a miner has a 400 per cent greater chance of dying of cancer than a miner who is not in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our mines will be open cut, so presumably there will be greater ventilation, but rich sources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mean high concentrations of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which mean high concentrations of radon gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have the Government assuring people that we will mine and export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> miners are told that they must be very careful to wash the dust off their faces and hands, yet there are no rules and regulations brought in to ensure that that happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some miners in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in Australia have already been shown to have been irradiated in their work, and some have left the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government Accounting Office in America reported to Congress that 1 1 000 lb of plutonium and enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had vanished from government factories there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We all remember the ship that sailed from Antwerp to Italy and when it arrived in Italy it was found that 200 tons of plutonium and enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had vanished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  President  Carter told South Korea that he was taking American troops home the South Koreans immediately said to him that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia was essential so that that country could produce nuclear weapons with which to protect itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has proposed certain safeguards if we mine and export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should the Government approve further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry it will retain the right to be selective in the countries to whom <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export will be permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia would seek to arrange with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries export level consultations to satisfy itself of the implementation of the provision of bilateral agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wishes to ensure that if a decision was taken to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span>  export,  the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards from the time it left Australia ‘s ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me quote  Dr Edward  Teller who has been working on the peaceful application of nuclear power and who was brought out here to encourage us to mine and sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you ask me whether I can guarantee that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, yellowcake, exported from Australia will never be used in war, I will have to admit that there is no such guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth proposal of the Government to protect us from the final use of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once used, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> produces plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we have used <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to produce nuclear power we have radioactive waste and, despite what  Senator Young  has said and despite the pious hopes he has that we may find a way to dispose of the waste, there is no known satisfactory way to deal with the waste at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who hope that we may find a way to deal with it, but if there was a satisfactory way to deal with it there would be somebody on top of this Parliament House yelling it to the four winds and those people would be from the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers Forum because they would have found a way to deal with all the people who object to the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian branch of the Australian Medical Association has pointed out that nuclear energy entails unprecedented potential risks for future generations via the possible erosion of the human gene pool because of the radiation and because of the attack on human genes by the material we produce by mining and using <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An international fuel cycle centre in Australia would take back spent fuel rods from overseas, extract the re-useable <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and fabricate it into new fuel rods for re-export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would strengthen non-proliferation by regaining the spent fuel derived from Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the moment we have something like two million tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when we hypocritically talk about the dangers of fast breeder reactors coming into the stream in the world, let us be fair dinkum and talk about the amount of material that the use of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world will produce for the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there is an energy crisis coming in liquid fuel, but the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> does not help us produce liquid fuels in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Germany there are more people now in the movement against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining than there are in all the political parties combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should endeavour to ensure that the Atomic Energy Commission is in a position to act as an honest adviser to the Government on the use of atomic energy rather than as an agent for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information about atomic energy should be given in the market place so that the people of Australia can be concerned and fully informed about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no answer to the problems associated with the disposal of the waste that comes into being once <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is used to produce nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to congratulate  Senator Young  on the excellent coverage that he gave to the main arguments and on the information that he provided to the Senate about why he supported the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not need <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ourselves, but that is not the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not our problem; it is the problems of the countries that are using <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries have decided to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, whether for good or for bad, but that is not Australia’s decision; it is the decision of those other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is not in that position and, as I said earlier, is not seeking to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The countries that have decided to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will continue to use it whether or not Australia exports it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we refuse to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> those countries will still get <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have committed themselves to producing electricity from <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will get that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from any one of a number of countries which have vast quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference between our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that of other countries is that ours will be cheaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Melzer  pointed out, Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be mined on the surface and the mines will not be deep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that whether or not we export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> those countries will still use exactly the same amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and will produce exactly the same amount of waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, Australia probably has the cheapest <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, has laid down safeguards in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have absolutely no power to enforce those safeguards if we do not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but we have some power if we export it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could impose very rigid conditions on those countries that wish to import our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, with the threat that if they did not meet those conditions we would refuse to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we have the cheapest <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> more than any other <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

Scott and Co, has done a projection which showed that by 1995 our export earnings from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be about the same as our export earnings from wheat, about the same as our export earnings from wool, about half the value of our export earnings from coal, about two-thirds of our export earnings from iron, more than our export earnings from sugar and more than our export earnings from beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people have a genuine fear of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and I respect that fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> and its byproducts can be some of the most dangerous products that we know, but there are many other dangerous products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suspect that the opponents of the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have other motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Labor Party certainly will not win elections by opposing the exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as I will demonstrate later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we hear protests when Russia accelerates tremendously its use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well recognised that Russia’s safeguards in respect of the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are minimal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Melzer  quoted some figures that purported to support what she claimed was a fact, that the majority of Australian people are against the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The majority of people in the Goldfields want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia, including Yeelirrie, and they want a pilot plant in Kalgoorlie Boulder . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Kalgoorlie should have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need the money from <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the article headed ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span>’s critical mass: The unions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But  Mr Isaacs  did say that if Labor won the Assembly election last Saturday, the party would co-operate with the Federal Government if it decided to go ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this vehemently anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> union of 95 000 has been discussing with executives of Peko Mines Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Co. the question of exclusive rights to cover all workers involved in the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two companies are joint partners with the Federal Government in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Project and are strong supporters of the pro-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobby, the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers’ Forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That union is arguing in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to take place in the Northern Territory, it will be MWU members who mine it . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bitterest struggle involving unions and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> may not be aimed at keeping the stuff in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the argument is not whether we will use <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, although the decision to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a moral and an economic one, it is not our moral and economic decision; it is the decision of the countries which are committed to the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be a matter of what newspaper one reads, but I can recall that ultra right wing newspaper  News Weekly  chastising Ray Gietzelt, the Federal Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, because of what it claimed were his utterances against the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>: supplying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extract when the reverse is the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my response to that claim, I commence this way: I was one of the 49 delegates who assembled at the Hotel Sheraton in Perth for the federal conference of the Australian Labor Party which carried a unanimous declaration with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mounting public concern is being expressed there as to what may happen in the event of a minor mishap with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Argument has arisen whether <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction in the Northern Territory can be carried out without excessive pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of conservationists had ‘rightly flogged’ the question that mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> itself may result in some hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a long acquaintance with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and I can remember going to the Finniss River when Rum Jungle was operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where the deceit occurs:  about the hazards of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the answer was that they had monitored all the streams and there was no evidence at all of any deterioration in the streams or in the country due to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am trying to show that I fail to see how with any existing safeguards in an area of high tropical rainfall we will be able to combat the impregnating of the Alligator River with excessive impurities arising from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I answer that response by saying, based on facts, that, if the Finniss River was polluted when we were told that there were adequate safeguards, I fail to see how any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction in the Northern Territory will not completely pollute the Alligator River system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The smell of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> filled their nostrils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting, and nobody else has suggested, that 40 per cent should not be mined at all, but I do say that with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we have to look at what is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to buy that outright but I do test the sincerity of the propounders of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to say that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will be open cut mining and therefore there will be less danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that Gallup polls published in the  Bulletin  three or four issues ago showed Australians were very much in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction but the gap is narrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for that reason I say unhesitatingly that Australia will not lose by our not mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in mining, be it coal or <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, we have these buccaneers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Thomas  that if we have <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction we will be adopting the Pontius Pilate approach and saying: ‘Well, this is their problem ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators have taken the matter a little further and talked about countries coming here to take the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us forget the idea that Japan will invade us over the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At present we are debating the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major concern was not whether there were inherent dangers in nuclear power generation but rather whether such dangers were sufficient to require Australia to ban <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stated that Australia should be free to go ahead with the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as having one of the largest <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lodes in the free world the Northern Territory is also a unique area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the proposal was being looked at we became aware of the fact that the area contained one of the largest <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lodes in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox agreed that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would be highly profitable and that there would be benefits to the Australian shareholders and to the Australian citizens through the taxes that would be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining would provide jobs and, of course, this is a most important aspect when we are looking at the emerging state of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall earnings from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining have been estimated to rank with those of the black coal and iron ore industries in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to come to grips with the fact that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lode in the Northern Territory is a vast source of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Se we have to think of the same situation when we are looking at our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated that for a 1000 megawatt power generator the annual fuel consumption would be 2.3 million tonnes of coal, 420 million gallons of fuel oil, 64 billion cubic feet of liquid petroleum gas or 30 tonnes of enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or, in yellowcake standards, 130 to 140 tonnes of yellowcake as it leaves <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the mining operation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill has mentioned the Finniss River, and rightly so, but I think the thing that should be made clear is that the problem with the Finniss River operation was with the heavy metals which were involved in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because of the heavy metals that were mined in conjunction with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its leader in the House of Representative and its leader in the Senate are on record, when in government, as saying what they would do with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, how they would export it and how they would come to agreements with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s three years in government, its ignorance- albeit emotional ignorance-about the subject on which it has chosen to hang its hat and its now contradictory stand on this subject of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will not convince anyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was about that time that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  announced that a decision on the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> probably would be reached during that recess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is developing into an emotive campaign when in fact all of us should be approaching the subject with a combination of realism and logic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fear tactics used by various Federal Ministers and the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers Forum are to be condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these countries have been mentioned as prospective buyers of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it can be seen just how little <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is really needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I interpolate here to say that a lot of people had not heard of the Third World until the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobby decided that it needed it for power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobby insists on conducting that type of debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party has contributed more than the Government has to the national debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has published a book called  <span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- A Fair Trial  which, unlike the view put by the Government and its mining friends, gives both sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion is that this early planning received the green light from the Government long before it admitted to the people of this country that it would allow <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least one of his messages to the Prime Minister was totally distorted in a leak from the Prime Minister’s office which indicated that  Mr Justice  Fox now totally supported <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Energy resources can be divided into two groups- the non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, gas, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, et cetera, and the renewable resources such as solar energy, wind power, tidal and wave power, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> currently makes up less than 5 per cent of the world ‘s nonrenewable energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No overseas country has an absolute need for our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact was emphasised quite recently by a European scientist who said that overseas countries would not break into boils if they did not get Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For at least 15-20 years, most developing countries will have relatively little need for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find that the Government is not even going to allow a parliamentary debate before a decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussion of a policy on the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must be conducted in the context ofthe overall energy demands of Australia, likely world energy demand, and the energy resources available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Energy resources can be divided into two groups, the nonrenewable resources (coal, oil, gas, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> etc.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We depend today almost totally on the non-renewable energy resources, so it is worth mentioning that the world’s resources are mainly coal (70 per cent), with important contributions from oil (14 per cent) and natural gas (12 per cent), while <span class="highlight">uranium</span> currently makes up less than 5 per cent of the world’s non-renewable energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The OECD it should be remembered, includes the U.S.A., Japan, France and the U.K., all mentioned as potential buyers of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Energy conservation has been assigned a very important role by the Fox <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Report, and has been studied by many other eminent authorities; the 1974-75 House of Commons Inquiry in the U.K., and the recent U.S.A. study by the Ford Foundation are two examples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that there are certain dangers associated with it- unlike people on the opposite side of the campaign who say that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> yellowcake is so good and so safe that you can eat it; you can have it for dessert three times a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Thomas was sitting in the chamber today and he heard the enthusiastic reception from that side of the chamber in regard to the digging for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is prepared to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at this point in history without having any adequate safeguards as to what finally becomes of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> has disappeared before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there are a lot of people on the Government side and amongst the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners who want to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because they believe it will help us to pay for our oil imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Thomas referred to and placed firmly heavy emphasis upon the results of polls showing the number of Australians in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest figures, which  Senator Thomas  apparently declined to cite, show that less than 47 per cent of Australians favour <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding my remarks on this debate, again I wish to say that the Prime Minister has made a hasty decision to go ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose while polls show the number of people in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining declining, we will not be given opportunities to debate the matter anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy to be announced next week undoubtedly will show no concern for the major recommendations of the Fox reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At practically the start of my remarks at 2.15 p.m. when speaking on behalf of the Opposition in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry debate,  Senator Wriedt  passed me a note saying that the rumours were false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also it seems that what honourable senators opposite used to consider the biggest issue before the country- namely, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue- has been washed out of their hair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let us realise that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue is a fait accompli. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal effect of not making Australian supplies available would be to make it necessary for other countries to put more effort into developing and mining known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the development of nuclear power in the rest of the world can continue whether or not Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We come to the question of whether or not we should mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- not whether the other countries should be using it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt was generally agreed in evidence that if Australia does not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the rest of the world in the first half of the 1980s additional <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling facilities will have to be established in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the first Fox report and its conclusions about the position in the world supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if Australia did not mine and export its share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first relates to the dangers associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry reported: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we do not think that the waste situation is at present such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it is plain that the situation demands careful watching and, depending on developments, regular and frequent reassessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, even in a few years, satisfactory disposal methods have not been established, it may well be that supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by Australia should be restricted, or even terminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is only mined and milled for export … no material of value to terrorists would be produced in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that this risk alone constitutes a sufficient reason for Australia declining to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government fully accepts that if it were in future to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export from Australia, this would carry with it added responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We view adequate safeguards as a fundamental pre-requisite of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export which we would also expect responsible customer countries for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> readily to accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were: the need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; the application of effective International Atomic Energy agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and re-processing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do so, we will be behaving in a responsible fashion as one of the major <span class="highlight">uranium</span> developers in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we decide to supply our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and then maintain that supply at a plentiful level, fewer fast breeder reactors will be necessary in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was  Senator Melzer  who said that the incidence of cancer was 400 times greater in the case of a miner in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report deals with a study of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners in Colorado conducted by the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we care to export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to keep that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in plentiful supply, there is far less likelihood of the dangerous fast breeder reactors being used throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She said that the rest of the world could go on using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and developing their nuclear industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I think  Senator Melzer  put up a very convincing argument, sufficient to deter anybody from involving themselves in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the strong arguments according to those who support the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia is that we have a responsibility to the rest of the world to sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that if we do not care about the rest of the world we will leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground; but if we really care about the rest of the world, we will export the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are of miniscule proportions when compared with the places to which our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will not go to those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance will not come in the form of sending them <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; it will come in the form of helping in their development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the factors why we as a nation are wrong to make up our minds now and say: ‘Yes, we will export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’ or ‘No, we will not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who says that forever and a day there will no export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and the ministerial statement on nuclear safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard this as an important opportunity to put down a position statement in advance of the Government’s decision and to set out the reasons which I think are relevant in regard to the future of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to make a number of observations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one will disagree that if it is inappropriate to force <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on particular nations perhaps we should not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the honourable senator has not established by that argument at all the propositions that we in Australia should not mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not established the proposition that we should not use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or that we should not sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was, I believe, one of the most useful and balanced presentations I have heard on the subject of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been put to Australians that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is inherently unsafe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conclusion reached by the Australian Labor Party at least is that because of this we should leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> where is is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First  Mr Justice  Fox found that under the procedures laid down in the Australian code of practice for the operation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, radiation from mining and milling is not such as to justify a ban on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly the commissioners found that the next steps of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> processing are considered to involve only a few problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report goes on to suggest that some of the dangers involved in the extraction and use of alternative sources of fuel, some of the fossil fuels, particularly coal may be greater than those involved in the extraction and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that around the world there is considerable public support for the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a majority averaging out at between 65 per cent and 70 per cent they determined the vote in every case in favour of the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and in favour of the development of nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that Australians are pretty evenly divided at the moment on the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we can just talk briefly about the process of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, I note that it has been said already that we have already had some demarcation disputes between the trade unions determined to have control of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when it is approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available in our major deposits is surface <span class="highlight">uranium</span> easily accessible by a very simple process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is available in part of the country where Aborigines have been living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In commenting on the amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available in this country,  Mr Justice  Fox, made this comment on page 39 of his report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effective energy content of known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves is potentially greater than of known fossil fuel reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a world in need of safe, clean, low cost energy and we must at least consider <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a source of this energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a highly developed technology for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an international commission on radiological protection which has set down the medical safeguards which are to be employed for those involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is much more dangerous than the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being told about the potential hazards of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but it has been my misfortune over the years to have to treat people with the actual disabilities which have come from miners’ lung, from chronic obstructive airways disease directly attributable to their involvement in the coal mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The generation of electricity from coal is associated with environmental damage far in excess of that which has occurred or which would occur from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expense of coal is greater than the expense of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the processing planned for this country is simple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involves the crushing and chemical treatment of the rock taken from the ground so that we can extract the yellowcake, or <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide,  U3O8. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally the yellowcake contains more than 90 per cent <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example there is the  Australian Financial Review  of 10 October and the journal of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate conducted on its pages, which I read with great interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us ask what contribution we are going to find from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the radiation background to which we are going to be exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion passed at the Labor Party Conference included the words that there should be no mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable senators opposite that we require <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, not for generation of power in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country a number of consequences will flow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that we will have to start importing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because if we are to operate our own radioisotope production we will require <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for our own reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we cannot carry out our own task of keeping our medical industry running. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more than that, if we stop mining, processing and exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, what effect will it have on the rest of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By mining and exporting our own <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we have a chance to assist in the policy outlined by President Carter to assist in the policy of retarding or preventing the development of a plutonium industry which involved the recycling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and which is more likely to develop if supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide are difficult to find. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry is well controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed at the Labor Party which has argued not for a moratorium but for an indefinite halt to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue does not concern <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to use that technology I must have available <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in our reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must acknowledge, as  Senator Collard  stated, that no one argues that there is no risk at all associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has developed good safeguards in relation to the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as I said earlier this evening, I am completely at a loss to understand why in another place the Government declared this Bill an urgent Bill and at 8 o’clock tonight the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Withers)  sought the adjournment of a nationally important debate on the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and moved that the Senate adjourn until 9.30 tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognise the dangers to the health of all Australians and future generations of mankind by the mining, processing and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> whether for peaceful or destructive purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take steps to defer any decisions in relation to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for a period of five years during which time adequate community discussion can occur on all the issues involved in the arguments for or against such mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is endeavouring to assure the public that it is concerned to see that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is shipped overseas only with proper international atomic energy agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister tell me whether the Government has investigated whether any safeguards cover the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> awaiting export from Brisbane at the moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to receive just recently from the ACOA, courtesy of the executive of that union, something about its view on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the arrangements, the managing company for the exploration and mining of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits is the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will recall that this arrangement was entered into by the previous Labor Government so that mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory could be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that ought to be well remembered in view of the Labor Party’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Perth this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement was entered into to provide capital for the company to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the Government is aware that the Federal Council of the United Nations Association of Australia at its meeting on 21 August resolved almost unanimously to call upon the Australian Government to defer a decision on its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy in order to promote full public discussion on the questions raised by the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, based on authoritative information such as the 1972 report of the Sutcliffe Committee of the United Nations, and to develop a national energy policy which concentrates on energy conservation and research and development of safer energy sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister tell me whether the Government will take this expression of opinion into account before announcing its policy on the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was giving a lead to the rest of Australia with respect to a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant only about 18 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a committee still operating in South Australia examining nuclear energy in that State and examining still the possibility of attracting a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to tell a little story about a mining company that has, in the vicinity of Lake Frome- dare I say it- a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This technique leaches the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ore body leaving the undesirable elements underground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 22,000 tons- or ‘tonnes’ I think the correct term is- of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> represent about $ I billion - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many jobs would result if we installed a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very false and very unfair accusation was made against  Mr Don  Dunstan by  Senator Jessop  when he spoke about  Mr Dunstan  ‘s support for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  was one of the leaders of the campaign for the adoption of Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at the Perth Conference, because he had set up a committee within the South Australian Parliament to examine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and its consequences and ramifications and the committee reported to him that it knew of no way in which safety could be guaranteed in the treating of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan,  in all honesty and sincerity, said that therefore he could not go along with supporting the mining or export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I present the statement of the Prime Minister on Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the tabling of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry’s first report on 11 November 1976, there has been a wide-ranging debate inside the Parliament and in the public arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this time, the Government has given painstaking consideration to the Ranger Inquiry’s valuable and constructive reports and to all other information available to it on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This exhaustive consideration of the issues and evidence has led the Government to decide that there should be further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under strictly controlled conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looked at both the world-wide and the local regional environmental issues associated with the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>: the issues of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear safeguards; the contribution of nuclear power to world energy requirements; the economic implications of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the Inquiry concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we do not think that the waste situation is at present such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to  export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it is plain that the situation demands careful watching, and depending on developments, regular and frequent reassessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that this risk alone constitutes a sufficient reason for Australia declining to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does, however, provide a further reason why the export of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, including what is proposed to be done with it, and where, are matters which the Government should keep under constant scrutiny and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The export by Australia of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under stringent safeguards would give effect to our obligations under Articles III and IV of the Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, the Inquiry concluded that the total renunciation of any intention to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was undesirable and most unlikely to produce any worthwhile outcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, having considered the Inquiry’s report and all the other evidence before it, has decided that the goals of limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and alleviating the world’s energy problems are best served by Australia agreeing now to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that were it not for that sense of responsibility, were it not for our wish to strengthen Australia’s voice in the moves against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, were it not for our obligation to provide energy to an energy deficient world, we would not have decided to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very substantial quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are required to fuel them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is manifest that: there is a need for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in a number of countries poorly endowed with fossil fuels; there is a world wide growth of the nuclear industry; there is a widespread concern about whether <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be available to satisfy these needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of their concern about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies, some countries are turning to those nuclear technologies involving reprocessing and the fast breeder reactor which would achieve the more effective use of available <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but which would increase the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia possesses 20 per cent of the Western world’s known reserves of low cost <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this situation we are in a special position of influence and have a corresponding moral responsibility to maximise protection against nuclear weapons proliferation by responding to the needs of many countries for adequate assurances of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has an obligation to the rest of the world to provide the energy resources- the coal, gas and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- that will be required to overcome the energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking the decision to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Australia can supply: energy that will provide jobs; energy that will heat homes; energy that will protect standards of living and enable them to be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking the decision to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Austalia can slow the movement towards the use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel and lessen the attendant increased risks of nuclear weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking the decision to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Australia’s ability to support more effective safeguards and minimise proliferation risks will be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave- The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has announced the Government’s decision to proceed with further expansion and development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is presently a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has had a long history of mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining and milling began at Rum Jungle and in the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory, at Mary Kathleen in Queensland, and at Radium Hill in South Australia in the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total amount exported was 7,860 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at Radium Hill did not commence until 1954, mining for radium commenced there early this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mining at Rum Jungle ceased in 1963, but treatment operations continued until 1971 and the output of about 2,250 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide was stockpiled by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following improved market conditions for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> early in the 1970s and the discoveries of substantial new Australian deposits, export contracts were obtained by Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd, Peko/EZ and Queensland Mines Limited amounting to 1 1,757 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide for delivery over the period 1976 to 1986. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A feature of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development policy of the Whitlam Government was direct Commonwealth participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government obtained a 42 per cent shareholding in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. On the basis of these arrangements re-commissioning of the mine began in 1974, and production commenced early in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Production and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is continuing at Mary Kathleen and to date 690 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide have been exported for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following its decision on the Mary Kathleen project the Whitlam Government tabled in the Parliament on 31 October 1974 a statement announcing a program of large scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Nothern Territory of Australia commencing with exploitation of the Ranger deposit to be followed by development of the Nabarlek, Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government also announced in its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development policy statement of 3 1 October 1974 that the Government stockpile of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> remaining from the earlier operations at Rum Jungle would be available to Peko/EZ and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recalled that central considerations in the Whitlam Government’s policy of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development were the economic benefits to Australia which would accrue and the responsibility Australia has as an energy rich nation in meeting the energy needs of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government’s statement on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development which I have already referred to and which was tabled in the Parliament on 31 October 1974 opened with the following words:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this statement is to outline the Government ‘s program for the rational development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in the Northern Territory; a program which will return substantial economic benefits to Australia from our supply of this vital energy resource to our overseas trading partners who face such grave difficulties in securing their energy requirements . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government’s commitment of Australia, and Australian companies, to meeting the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements of our trading partners continued and reached the very substantial amount of 100,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International assurances have been provided by Ministers that Australia will meet the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements of our major trading partners, which could amount to a total of about 100,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by 1990. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very substantial quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are required to fuel the nuclear reactors in operation and in prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western world’s low cost <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves are estimated to total about 1.9 million short tons, of which Australia’s reserves amount to 376,000 short tons- that is 20 per cent of the Western world ‘s known low cost reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annual <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements necessary to satisfy the projected growth in nuclear power are about 90,000 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide in 1985, 140,000 short tons in 1990 and 200,000 tons in the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly there has to be a substantial expansion in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production in the world if the requirements for nuclear fuel and energy are to be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that nuclear energy usage for electric power generation has proceeded in other ountries without access to Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, id will continue, in no way relieves Australia of s responsibilities as an energy rich nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply highlights the futility of leaving our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Alligator Rivers Region is the world ‘s largest uncommitted <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources of the Region could be as much as five to ten times the resources identified to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has a clear international responsibility to develop further its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry report stated that total renunciation of intention to supply Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was not justified and was undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government recognises its responsibility to ensure that Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources are further developed and we will proceed to do so on the basis recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accepting the responsibility of further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development we will ensure that that development will be very strictly controlled, with the fullest and most effective protection for the environment and the welfare of the Aboriginal people as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves of the Alligator Rivers Region are located in an area of environmental and Aboriginal significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report recommends most stringent measures of control and regulation over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development and the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be allowing further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development only where it is satisfied that strict regulation and control can properly protect the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will deal now with the administrative structure for control and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Marketing Authority or similar marketing arrangements to achieve the objective of orderly development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will establish a uniform code of practice for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth element of administrative machinery is the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Marketing Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we will not take a final decision on marketing arrangements for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until the legal implications of foreign anti-trust laws have been fully examined by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would ensure that the Government at all times has proper knowledge, oversight and control of the commercial arrangements under which Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government attaches the greatest importance to orderly development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will want to see our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry develop as a stable and secure long term supplier of energy to other countries on fair and reasonable terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not allow the development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry to be dictated by volatile events in markets abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will therefore always be in a position to move immediately to terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth element in the administrative arrangements the Government will put in place is the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry to establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council, responsible to the Minister for National Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body will fulfil the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry for the establishment of a body with adequate representation of the people to advise the Government and with a duty to report annually to the Parliament with regard to the export and use of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final element in the administrative arrangements is that the Government will move to establish by legislation, together with the States, a uniform code of practice to apply to all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely in accord with the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry and will provide a proper and adequate basis on which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will proceed so as to harmonise the interests of development, environmental protection, National Park values and Aboriginal welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Memorandum of Understanding provides for the Commonwealth, through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, to engage in a joint venture with Peko/EZ for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Ranger, beginning with the establishment of a mine of 3,300 short tons capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capital is to be provided in the proportions 7216 per cent by the Commonwealth and 2716 per cent by Peko/EZ, with Peko/EZ receiving the net proceeds of sale of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In coming to this conclusion, the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the Atomic Energy Act would have less force if the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already stated, the Government will adopt that recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will bring with it significant economic benefits for the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry assumed that production and sales would begin in 1981-82 at a rate of 2,000 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide increasing to 10,000 short tons in 1985-86. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry’s forecasts of economic benefits concluded that, at a price level of SUS30 per lb, the addition to our national income resulting from further development of an Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry could account for more than 1.3 per cent of” projected levels of national income in the mid 1990s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry concluded that, should the higher prices assumed in its analysis be achieved, namely a price of SUS30 per lb, the export earnings of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry would eventually exceed the earnings in recent years of any of our other major export industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry’s forecasts also indicate that development of a national <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will result in the creation of considerable direct employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the assumption that construction of the first project would commence in 1977-78, with production and sales commencing in 1981-82 at an average rate of around 2,000 short tons <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, increasing at about that rate until 1994-95 when total output would reach 27,300 short tons, the Ranger Inquiry forecast that a total workforce of between 2,000 and 2,500 would probably be directly employed in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The employment opportunities created by development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will not, of course, end at the mine site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The employment prospects would, of course be further enhanced should Australia at some future stage decide to upgrade and enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> prior to export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this attitude we will study the feasibility of upgrading and enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, and preserve Australia’s options in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The joint <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment feasibility study between Australian and Japan, initiated by the Whitlam Government, will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry did not forecast possible levels of employment that could result from a fully integrated <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia, but a recent authoritative study by the South Australian Government, which I have previously tabled in this House, did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment opportunities, on the statistical data for the already established North American <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, would be such that a fully developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia could support directly and indirectly about 500,000 persons starting with a mining workforce of about 5000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic benefits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining for the Northern Territory will be particularly significant The Ranger Inquiry estimated that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations would add between $65m and $ 105m to incomes in the Territory- an increase of between 16 per cent and 26 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry concluded that:  a regional <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry producing up to 12,500 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> per year would substantially enlarge the Northern Territory ‘s economy and could provide the stimulus for a much faster rate of economic growth in the area than would otherwise occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will wish to consider the accrual of an appropriate share of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> profits to the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will therefore initiate discussions with the industry on a possible framework for a secondary or resource-based tax on future earnings from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also decided that, as resources flow from the further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, additional funds will be provided to increase substantially our national effort on solar energy research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have outlined in this statement the detailed basis on which further development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it took its decision to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining under the stringent safeguards already announced, the Government gave the most careful consideration to the views of Aboriginal leaders as recorded in the Second Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and to the Inquiry’s recommendations on Aboriginal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very worried that the results of this Inquiry will open the doors to other companies who want to dig up <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on our sacred land . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has announced the Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In taking its decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the National Park, and Aboriginal land rights, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry commissioned under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I stated in the House of Representatives on 2 June 1977, ‘the two reports taken together represent a major contribution not only to Australia but also to international understanding of the environmental consequences of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in the broadest terms as it affects mankind ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first report of the Ranger Inquiry suggests, and the second report repeats, that the total renunciation of the intention to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was not justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To develop a uniform national Code of Practice to apply to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To adopt strict environmental controls and standards in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry found that a decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia must be based first and foremost on the adoption of a strategy which will achieve the best results in regard to proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ranger Inquiry will be advanced by a decision now to export Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first report of the Ranger Inquiry recommended that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports be subject to the fullest and most effective safeguards to ensure that nuclear materials are not misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a further statement today on the Government’s safeguards policy, which provides the basis for the Government’s decision to allow <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first finding of the Ranger Inquiry the Commissioners took the view that the environmental effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining could be adequately regulated and controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second finding of the Ranger Inquiry was that the hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if properly controlled and regulated, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that this finding clearly supports the Government’s decision in favour of allowing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry made it clear that it did not consider the present nuclear waste situation was such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has responded to this concern by deciding to establish, with the States, by appropriate legislation, a uniform national Code of Practice which will apply to all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry has noted the environmental problems that resulted from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that the measures which I have announced today will ensure that current and future <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining undertaken anywhere in Australia will be subject to adequate environment protection controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a National Park in this Region is central to the findings of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry recommended that environment protection of the Alligator Rivers Region could be accomplished in two ways, of which the establishment of a major national park was the first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided to appoint an officer, to be known as the Supervising Scientist, to exercise a supervisory and integrating role over all research and monitoring programs associated with environmental protection from the hazards of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Alligator Rivers Region and to advise on the specific environmental requirements for the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry the Supervising Scientist will be responsible to myself as Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and I hope to announce an appointment in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the decisions announced by the Prime Minister which I have elaborated today will ensure effective regulation and control of all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- On behalf of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  I make a statement on the health aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, made by the Minister today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has already announced the Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now propose to give in some more detail the measures that will be taken to protect the health of those involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling and those people living within the proximity of mines who could be exposed to possible hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department, in particular its Australian Radiation Laboratory, has for many years been aware of possible health hazards in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that my Department was involved in monitoring the health of those involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining which commenced at Rum Jungle early in the 1950s and lasted until the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The draft Code was circulated for comment to 94 recipients made up of appropriate Australian and State government departments and authorities, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and exploration companies and mining associations, and relevant trade unions and trade union councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Code was accepted by both this and the previous Government and was submitted in the evidence my Department gave to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It studied papers presented to, and discussions at, an international symposium on radiation protection in mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and thorium arranged by the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have so far dealt with the possible effect on health of radiation but there are other factors that will need to be considered in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that by following the program that I have outlined, my Department will ensure that the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be undertaken in Australia in such a way that the health of the public, including those actually employed in the mines, will be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard only today of the Government’s decision to allow the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Ranger in the Alligator Rivers area in Arnhem Land which will bring about an increased population in the area because of the people attracted to the mining towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of that section, I ask the Minister: What is meant by the statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Viner  on the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Part of the increased revenues which the Government will derive from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will be used in substantial additional funding of solar energy research as part of our National Energy Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was it correct that the representative of the Community expressed unilaterally an interest in negotiating an agreement between it and Australia for the purchase of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Community’s Commissioner indicate on what terms the Community would be prepared to purchase <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the  ‘AM’  report correctly state that the Australian Government would require better access for Australian agricultural and pastoral products before agreeing to any bilateral agreement on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; if so, what products were mentioned and what was the reaction of the Community’s Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Specifically, will the Minister provide the following information: (a) when was the organisation formed; (b) where does it meet; (c) how often does it meet; (d) who are its President and Secretary; (e) does it receive support from the Minister’s Depanment; and (f) is it affiliated in any way with the Australian <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers’ Forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware of a Press statement issued by the Northern Territory Teachers Federation dated 2 September 1977 regarding the Federation’s stand on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, in which it supports the left wing of the Labor Party in an indefinite moratorium and supports the Trades and Labour Council’s present stand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, as the Northern Territory Teachers Federation has directed its members not to serve in schools within the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area, will the Minister ensure that parents and children will not suffer because of the lack of teachers by employing teachers now in the Northern Territory within the Education Department who are not members of the Northern Territory Teachers Federation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister comment further on the Government’s attitude to the Federation’s four key issues in its statement, including the point that it believes this decision is a protection of its members against potential health risks involved in living in an area where <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is mined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for these scaremongers, who have no other arguments, to be reminded that for 20 years the mining, milling and nuclear reactor use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have existed throughout the world and if there are health hazards no emphatic evidence has been produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of what we do, there will be nuclear reactors and there will be mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During that outburst we have just listened to from  Senator Carrick,  did she hear him say that there is no danger to public health in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do draw the attention of  Senator Wriedt  and the Senate to the statement that I made on behalf of the Minister for Health when we were announcing the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining proposals some days ago in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant which was strongly advocated by  Mr Connor  when he was Minister for Minerals and Energy would have been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the proposal to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Lake Frome which would have provided, directly and indirectly, 1,000 jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have advocated that the future State Government ought to consider propositions concerning the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not promote the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in South Australia, Charlie Court and Bjelke-Petersen will beat us to the punch: That is the sort of attitude that we ought to be adopting in South Australia- an interest in our State which is losing industries now because of the absolute incompetence of the present South Australian Government whose sense of values is distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because I noticed last week when five ministerial statements were presented on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, one of the statements, presented by the Minister for National Resources and  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  belatedly admitted the fact that the Government was to spend $300,000 on rehabilitating the Finniss River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We promised Aboriginal landholders in the Northern Territory all royalties from mining on their land, but we have heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Withers)  say that the Government will have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the decision to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been taken by the Government without any consultation with the Aboriginal people and that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be exported and probably will be responsible for causing the loss of many lives in other countries; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that when in government the Australian Labor Party purchased 41.6 per cent of the Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">uranium</span> shares through a governmental instrumentality- the Australian Atomic Energy Commission- using the Australian taxpayers’ money, which percentage represented some 30,764,142 shares in the company, and then appointed  Mr Egerton,  a senior trade unionist, to the Mary Kathleen board to supervise the Labor Party’s interest in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the production and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide- yellowcake? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the case, following this commitment of the taxpayers’ money to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, is not the action of the Labor Party completely inexplicable in calling for a moratorium for an indefinite period, which would mean the leaving of all Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground, after having encouraged production and milling and arranged for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A feature of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development policy of the Whitlam Government was direct Commonwealth participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government obtained a 42 per cent shareholding in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. On the basis of these arrangements re-commissioning of the mine commenced in 1974, and production commenced early in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Production and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is continuing at Mary Kathleen and to date 690 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide have been exported for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following its decision on the Mary Kathleen project, the Whitlam Government tabled in the Parliament on 31 October 1974 a statement announcing a program of large scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Northern Territory of Australia commencing with exploitation of the Ranger deposit to be followed by development of the Narbarlek, Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government also announced in its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development policy statement of 3 1 October 1 974 that the Government stockpile of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> remaining from the earlier operations at Rum Jungle would be available to Peko-EZ and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recalled that central considerations in the Whitlam Government’s policy of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development were the economic benefits to Australia which would accrue and the responsibility Australia had as an energy-rich nation in meeting the energy needs of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government statement on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, which was tabled in Parliament on 3 1 October 1974, opened with the following words:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this statement is to outline the Government’s program for the rational development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in the Northern Territory; a program which will return substantial economic benefits to Australia from our supply of this vital energy resource to our overseas trading partners who face such grave difficulties in securing their energy requirements . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government’s commitment of Australia, and Australian companies, to meeting the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements of our trading partners continued and reached the very substantial amount of 100,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International assurances have been provided by Ministers that Australia will meet the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> requirements of our major trading  partners,  which could amount to a total of about 100,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by 1990. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was some live months ago, and it seems strange that an article of that vintage should be raised by way of question at this time, especially as the Government’s policy on the mining and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the various safeguards was put down in a very full statement in this place some seven days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say what action, if any, can be taken against groups advertising false information in the course of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring in particular to the advertisement in the Hobart  Mercury  last week headed ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- More Tasmanians say No’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the world-wide distribution of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> - ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 19 August I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the Government had investigated whether any safeguards covered the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> then awaiting export from Brisbane and was told that the information would be sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister confirm that the Australian Council of Trade Unions, unlike the Australian Labor Party, does not oppose outright the development of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this so in spite of attempts by the Australian Labor Party to enforce on all members, including those in the ACTU executive, an extreme partisan view on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and its problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister resolve from the statements of the  President  of the ACTU and the ALP just what the real policies of these bodies are on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to the statement made yesterday by the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers Forum,  Mr Mackay,  that the present Government was drunk with power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would this be in line with recommendations in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Report and the Government ‘s enunciated policy to increase research in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Does the Minister have any knowledge of the alleged $13 million Western Mining Corporation’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ‘testing plant’ announced in  The West Australian  of ‘26 March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer to ( 1) is in the affirmative, what is the specific purpose of the proposed plant and does it encompass <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that the Western Australian Government has had discussions with Western Mining Corporation regarding the possible construction in the KalgoorlieBoulder area of a pilot plant for processing ore from the company’s Yeelirrie <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pilot plant does not encompass <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I announced on 25 August 1977, the Government has decided that as resources flow from the further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, additional funds will be provided to increase substantially our national effort on solar energy research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My only connection with this film or organisation was a phone call I received about a week ago from a  Mr Kelvin  Thomson asking if I would chair a public discussion group on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Science seen an article in the form of a letter from  Sir Macfarlane  Burnet in which he suggests that a large proportion of the royalties the Government will demand and receive for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining should be used for research and development in the field of alternative energy resources, particularly solar energy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that a number of suggestions have been made as to what ought to happen with the royalties from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and that  Senator Cavanagh  has a question on notice on this subject in relation to Aborigines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware of what royalties are likely to come to the Government from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the potential capacity of the scientific establishments to utilise a major part at least of those royalties for research into alternative energy means, particularly solar energy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister have stated that as resources flow from the further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> additional funds will be provided to increase substantially our national effort on solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government income from further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is not, I understand, expected to increase for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> for Shipment from Brisbane <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 19 August 1977 and 8 September 1977  (Hansard,  pages 346 and 707 respectively)  Senator Melzer  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for National Resources, questions without notice concerning safeguards covering <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which was waiting at Brisbane for shipment on 19 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in question was destined for use by power generating utilities in Japan and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The material destined for Japan will be converted into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride in Canada and enriched in the United States prior to being shipped to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The material destined for the USA will be both converted to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride and enriched in the USA prior to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada and the United States, in which countries the material will be processed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride, are parties to the NPT and require stringent safeguards on the material processed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, in this regard as the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be finally processed into enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United States it will attract the full force of the safeguards policy recently announced by President Carter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that what he is trying to do is say that when Australia mines and exports <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we are going to add to what he sees as a problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of whether Australia mines and exports <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will not get over the difficulty which  Senator Brown  sees at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of people just using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they will go into plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am continually staggered at the Opposition, which I believe has a sincere belief in the containment of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, adopting a stance on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which will have but one end result, that is, of in fact pushing nations into the plutonium age and therefore into the proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the tragedy of the Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is that it will end up doing what the Labor Party expects it will not do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recently has indicated that it is its intention to authorise the construction of a closed town in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province within the area of the proposed national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it true to say that countries committed to the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will produce the same amount of waste whether we export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to them or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although Australia as a major exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be involved closely in international studies concerned with reprocessing and the nuclear fuel cycle there is no intention of Australia storing other countries’ radioactive wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall saying that he regarded the Australian Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as being a selfish one simply because the ALP is opposed to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until such time as there are proper safeguards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not surprised at that because my attention was drawn to media reports this morning that 61 Labor members of this place are at odds with their master, the  President  of the Australian Labor Party, over his policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and usage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 19 August and 8 September,  Senator Melzer  asked me questions on the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is endeavouring to assure the public that it is concerned to see that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is shipped overseas only with proper international atomic energy agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister tell me whether the Government has investigated whether any safeguards cover the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> awaiting export from Brisbane at the moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised by my colleague as follows: The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in question was destined for use by power generating utilities in Japan and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The material destined for Japan will be converted into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride in Canada and enriched in the United States prior to being shipped to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The material destined for the USA will be both converted to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride and enriched in the USA prior to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada and the United States, in which countries the material will be processed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride, are parties to the NPT and require stringent safeguards on the material processed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, in this regard, as the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be finally processed into enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United States, it will attract the full force of the safeguards policy recently announced by President Carter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister of the announcement made by the Prime Minister on the Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this information recently announced in the United States make a mockery of the assumptions this Government made of waste disposal when it announced its decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, does this indicate that the Government does not care about such matters and it is only after the revenue from Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-This is one of the things that fascinates me about the whole <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will be aware of a statement by  Mr Bob  Hawke at the conclusion of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress last week which included, among other matters, a threat to block exports under existing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts if the Government refuses the request of the ACTU for a referendum on the issue of the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the contracts in question were approved by the former Liberal Country Party Government and supported by the Whitlam Government when it was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Whitlam Government gave the strongest assurances to other countries that Australia would supply them with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that is the sort of attitude that some people in the Labor Party in Australia are taking on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we are on the subject of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> I have had brought to my attention the answer given to an earlier question asked by  Senator Coleman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that in his statement to the Parliament some weeks ago the Prime Minister said that an Australian Government would reserve the right to cease the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in future if it saw fit to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If Australia enters into an arrangement to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> subject to certain safeguards and conditions and those conditions are not met, it is the other country which has put an end to the contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Government decided its policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the Government and its inter- departmental committees finished their study of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Second Report (Fox Report); if so, when is the Government likely to implement the following recommendation made in the Fox Report: ‘That section 87A(2) of the Northern Territory Mining Ordinance 1939-1976 should be amended so that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining lease may be forfeited by the Administrator without a recommendation from the Atomic  Energy Commission ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia was announced on Thursday, 25 August1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is: In view of the fact that the feeling is growing that the Government is withholding the legislation so as to ensure compliance with its wishes in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports- a proposition which may well be quite incorrect- can the Minister say when the proposed legislation will be introduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister able to say whether, as is claimed by the executives, the copper belt at Roxby Downs in South Australia may be similar to the famous Central African copper province and that drilling has intersected a very large body of copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mineralisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether it would be economical to mine the copper and stockpile the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as I understand has been suggested by  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the attitude of the South Australian Premier represent a departure from the present Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As will be recalled, it was not very long ago that, in collaboration with the Whitlam Government, the Dunstan Government was extremely enthusiastic about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits and a large scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, honourable senators will recall that the Dunstan Government completed a comprehensive study of the economic benefits from the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, the studies showed that there would be employment for 20,000 people and that half a million Australians would benefit directly and indirectly from the development of an integrated <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, the Labor Party does not quite know where it is on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surprising how they keep popping up all the time, if not about Omega then about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the same group of people and they are now opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe its supporters are in no small measure embarrassed by the fact that the Fraser Government has adopted after long and careful examination a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy that is determined to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, we have had a hasty decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining offered as an answer to chronic unemployment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is also the threat over the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as an example of how this can be done, recently there was a very extensive overseas television coverage of those areas in the Northern Territory involved in the Government’s recent announcement of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Canberra Times  of today- Wednesday, 5 October- has reported on its front page under the heading ‘Aborigines Protest at Mine Start’ that the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining project in the Northern Territory plans to have the construction of a dam, road works, et cetera, commenced shortly and before the wet season begins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government consider the appointment of a person on the spot who will be responsible for close liaison and understanding between government, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners and the Aboriginal people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally it was apparent that the Prime Minister was going to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an excuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party has since discovered that its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy is not as popular with the public as the Liberal Party believed it would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular another confidential document published in the  Australian Financial Review  a couple of weeks ago showed that the Liberal Party in fact has decided not to mention the alleged economic benefits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at all because it is terrified of a public backlash against the implication that the Liberal Party is prepared to jeopardise the entire global environment for a grubby dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister clearly was preparing to hold an election on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue until he became aware of the relative unpopularity of the Government’s view on this issue and particularly its unpopularity with one of its traditionally strong areas of support, the female voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must speculate what the Government’s reaction would have been, having lost 25 seats in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Government have claimed that the loss of 25 seats constituted a massive public endorsement of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of what one’s personal views may be on whether questions like this should or should not be decided by referendum, if the Government really wanted to test public opinion on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, that clearly was the most effective way to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent, having found that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue was likely to be counterproductive, that the Government is now paving the way for an election on the question of industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be there to tell the people what I dislike most about the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, there are ample opportunities for the people of Australia to demonstrate their needs, to demonstrate their wishes and to demonstrate their concern not only on the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and unemployment but also on the vital issue of broken promises, promises that were made prior to, during and after the election of this Government in December 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span>: Programs by Australian Broadcasting Commission  (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When did the Australian Broadcasting Commission televise a  Monday Conference  program concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monday Conference presented three programs on the subject of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on 17 February 1975; 24 November 1975; and 29 November 1976 (except in New South Wales, which saw the last program on 2 December 1976). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everybody knows that as far as fuel is concerned, whatever our differences on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> might be, it can be said that in the next decade coal will be king. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when the Leader of the Government  (Senator Withers)  and his colleagues brought down the reports dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it was remarkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox was the Presiding Commissioner of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry established by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will also give policy advice to the Government respecting bilateral safeguards agreements and on the nonproliferation aspects of commercial contracts for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox, with his background and experience in this field-so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality of the reports of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- has indicated that he is prepared to accept this task, a task which is most important for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they are as useless as the idea that we should have a referendum to determine a matter on which a policy has been announced- the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has seen fit to supply all primary and secondary schools in Victoria with sets of the papers put out as the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> decision and tabled as such in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the cost to the Government in supplying such material which gives its side of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Government reconcile that statement from an authority such as the chief of the IAEA with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> statement made by this Government in August? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will decrease the risks of further proliferation of nuclear weapons … it will help make a safer world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether or not Australia mines and exports <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, there is no doubt that a large number of countries will go into the nuclear age and build nuclear power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The previous  speaker, Senator Robertson,  mentioned the problems-indeed, there are many problems -of the Northern Territory as an emerging State; but one thing that will help get the Northern Territory on its feet is its vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and the mining of them in the next few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That was a most inciting and irresponsible remark from a man in his position, a man who has not yet conducted a poll amongst his own supporters to see what they think about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those of us who had an opportunity to watch  Monday Conference  last night saw and heard a debate in considerable depth which would have given us cause to pause before supporting too strongly the development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources- not so much because of the by-products of use for peaceful purposes but because of the danger of proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As stated by the Acting Minister for National Resources in the House of Representatives on 19 April 1977, the Commonwealth Government, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd have completed negotiations on arrangements for the Government’s stockpile to be made available to Peko/EZ to meet early deliveries under their existing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that on 3 February 1976 the Government announced its intention to sell its 41.6 per cent interest in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not disposed of its shareholding in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. Kathleen Investments (Australia) Limited, a former major shareholder in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd, initiated legal proceedings challenging the validity of the shareholding held in Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 23 August 1977  Senator Brown  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for National Resources, a question without notice on the Government’s intentions regarding its interest in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977 the Government’s policy on the further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry was outlined in detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will involve 72’/5 per cent of the capital being provided by the Commonwealth and 27V4 per cent by Peko/EZ, with Peko/EZ receiving the net proceeds of the sale of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> produced by the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development whether he is in a position to answer the apprehensions of  Dr Mosley,  the Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining targets in the Northern Territory make the concept of the Kakadu National Park, as envisioned in the Fox Report, impossible to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the full staff available but  Senator Mulvihill’s  attention should be drawn to the various pieces of information contained within the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> kit that was issued to all honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the concern shown in some sectors of the Northern Territory that the Kakadu National Park should be proclaimed before <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining commences, can the Minister indicate what stage planning for the park has reached? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A critical factor will be the availability of survey information to fix boundaries of the park and those areas that are to be excised as recommended in the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and subsequently agreed on by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is forcing the Opposition to inconvenience its senators, to break their appointments and commitments tomorrow; but a member of the House of Representatives is going to participate at Port Hedland in a debate on a very important question, namely, the exploitation and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was supposed to be- and rightly so-part of the national debate that we are undertaking so that the electorate can be enlightened on the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the people will oppose the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has at the back of its mind the idea that if there is a dispute over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the Australian Railways Union shunters or members of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen jack up, it will use members of the National Union of Railwaymen as political mercenaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that, if there were to be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate in Australia, especially in a magazine entitled  Education  at least it would have been put on a level that educated people could understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not opposed to a proper and sensible debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because we believe that our case will stand up to anything anybody else can offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has no intention of selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to people like Idi Amin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But merely because Australia has no intention of selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, that is not to say that he would not have the capacity to obtain it elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great tragedies of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate is that people are simple enough to believe that if we leave our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground and take no interest in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, then proliferation will not happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the substance of the earlier parts of the honourable senator’s question, it is true that during the term of the Whitlam Labor Government encouragement was given to mining companies to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing odd about that because, after all, as we all know, and as people who have some knowledge about this matter know, Australia has been mining and exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for over 20 years both from Rum Jungle and from the Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd. mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, some 15 to 20 years ago Australia was one of the major exporters of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that considerable quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were mined at Mary Kathleen and Rum Jungle and it was exported all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were plans afoot during the term of the Whitlam Government to expand <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a Government that was totally and bitterly opposed to the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, what a strange decision to come to! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have forgotten the dates when these announcements were made but we never saw a demonstrator with a placard saying: ‘Down with Whitlam because he has entered into partnerships with mining companies to mine and continue exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we ever saw any demonstrators when the previous Whitlam Government quite properly announced that it would honour contracts entered into for the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> prior to that announcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now suddenly, merely because this Government announces a continuation of the Whitlam Labor Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy- except that our policy provides better safeguards; except that we have  Mr Justice  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large to look after nonproliferation; except that generally it is a better policy- demonstrations are now occurring, demonstrations which have been whipped up by the Labor Party simply for mean political reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the answer he gave yesterday to a question asked by  Senator Wood  about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  said:   it is true that during the term of the Whitlam Government encouragement was given to mining companies to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: As these facts sit oddly with the Labor Opposition’s present stance on mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, can he confirm that the Labor Government led by  Mr Whitlam  did in fact have this quite different attitude when it was recently in office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of it, as I remember it, was: Why should there now be demonstrations about the present Government’s policy to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under very strict safeguards when some years back when the Whitlam Labor Government was adopting exactly the same policy one never saw hide nor hair of the demonstrations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 30 October 1974, the Whitlam Labor Government signed an agreement with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltdknown as Peko-EZ- for the development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits and that agreement was tabled in the Parliament on 31 October 1974, almost three years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties to this memorandum desire to procure the development and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Ranger Project area in the Northern Territory and the production and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate from that ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the construction, operation and maintenance of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore treatment plant for the production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate and other agreed mineral products derived from ore mined in the Ranger Project area; (iti) the delivery to Australia . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that would also mean  Mr Whitlam  because at that stage he thought he was Australia- of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced from the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore treatment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the project area shall be progressively developed and mined (commencing with the Ranger Number One ore body). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is an indication of how important the Whitlam Labor Government, two days short of two years ago, thought it was to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the Ranger area of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the very interesting information he gave the chamber this afternoon indicating the prominent part played by  Mr Whitlam  as Prime Minister in encouraging the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia, is he aware that -since this Government continued that policy  Mr Whitlam  has led demonstrations against the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed- I have no personal knowledge pf the matter- that an antiuranium march was held in the city of Perth in Western Australia in recent weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose we ought not be surprised that it is something short of two years since he signed a memorandum with two companies in Australia for the urgent and expeditious mining of up to 6,600 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a year and that the honourable member should be part of such an operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said yesterday, I should have thought that on 28 October 1975 there would have been an enormous exodus from the Whitlam Ministry upon  Mr Whitlam  signing that document to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the Ranger field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the situation now, not one of yesterday’s men in the Parliament does not now say- whether he believes it or not, it is in accordance with directions laid down by his masters in Perth at the Australian Labor Party Conference earlier this year-that he is opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he did not resign over the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the same technique used against  Mr Snedden  in 1 975 over the blocking of the Budget; in late 1975 in regard to a change of mind falsely attributed just a few months ago to  Mr Justice  Fox concerning the export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; and finally, of course, the speculation, which the Prime Minister has over the last four months fed, about a premature election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item he took from the newspapers on Monday was the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> demonstrations in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In her question Miss Jenkins said that when listening to the Senate broadcast yesterday she had heard a senator say that in Perth two years ago  Mr Whitlam  had signed a statement saying that he would like to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been said in the Parliament, and in recent months I have also spoken to several gatherings outside the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Has  Mr Whitlam  ever said anything of the sort- that he would like to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Project in the Northern Territory <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>signed this afternoon a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the companies for the development and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Ranger area in the Northern Territory and for the production and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate from that ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also a three-page attachment to this document headed ‘Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties to this memorandum desire to procure the development and rnining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Ranger Project area in the Northern Territory and the production and sale  of  <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate from that ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, by contrast with what has happened in recent months with the announcements of the Fraser Government’s safeguards for the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the control over exports, the control of the disposal of high radiation wastes and the prevention or limitation of proliferation, particularly with regard to plutonium, my understanding is that no such developments existed during the time of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has considered the detail of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining agreement entered into between the Whitlam Government and the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd partners- Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But subject to those conditions precedent being performed there is no doubt that the Whitlam Government intended with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd to mine and export up to 6,600 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two conditions precedent were: Consideration of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and a report by the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that the honourable senator, and his Government committed themselves, subject to two conditions precedent which were only to give consideration to those reports, to the mining and export of 6,600 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate recall my question last week about the change of attitude towards <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining by the Leader of the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Leader of the Government recall that  Mr Whitlam  denied that he had said that he would like to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has  Mr Whitlam  ever said that he would like to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in that paper, amongst a number of other things, are these words: ‘Three <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling plants, $225m. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of 3 <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling plants in the Northern Territory and assistance to the Cooper Basin natural gas consortium, in which the Australian Government is now a partner, was included . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nation, every State and Territory would benefit from the development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, our natural gas, our coal- our immense natural resources of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s wealth of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources offers vast opportunities for the establishment of an enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On or about 28 October 1975 the then Prime Minister signed a memorandum with Peko Mines Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd. On the same day he issued a Press statement in which he clearly indicated the Whitlam Labor Government s intention to mine and export up to 6,600 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and the Government apparently take great delight in the fact that the Labor Party has allegedly changed its policy on the export and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator had been here last week he would have known that this matter arose from the fact that  Mr E.  G. Whitlam said on television to Miss Lindy Jenkins that he had never signed anything about the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He ought also to know that on 28 October 1975  Mr Whitlam  entered into a contract with Peko-EZ to mine and export 6,600 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and I refer again to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is it a fact that in this clause  Mr Whitlam  agreed to pay compensation to the companies, Peko and EZ, if Australia withheld sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the Ranger projects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event that in the national interest Australia withholds from sale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced by the Ranger Project, an arbitrator shall be appointed to decide what compensation, if any, but not exceeding world market price, should be given by Australia to offset the adverse financial effect on Peko and EZ resulting from this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite obvious from the compensation clause put in for Peko and EZ that there was a definite and firm intention to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government was totally, firmly and absolutely committed to the rnining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and most likely also to the enrichment of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that  Dr Mabon  is very impressed with the safeguards requirements laid down by the Australian Government with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether the Government has agreed to supply the United Kingdom Minister’s long-term requirement of 1,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> per annum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labour Minister’s mission to Australia to purchase <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide had the endorsement of the United Kingdom trade unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether Australia has agreed to supply 1,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a year I shall have to make inquiries for the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is worth about $40 a pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier in Question Time, we all recall that the Labor Government, through  Mr Khemlani,  was desperately anxious to borrow $4,000m overseas, at least $225m of which was to go into building a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so following the complete turnaround of  Mr Whitlam  and the Australian Labor Party with regard to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger Project shall continue in force during the economic life of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Project area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that that spells out very clearly that the then Labor Government, under  Mr Whitlam,  was pressing for a full go-ahead for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and giving every encouragement and financial support to the mining partners, Peko <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should hope that by now the Australian electorate would be well aware that in the period 1974-75 the Whitlam Labor Government was pressing ahead with the mining, export and, most likely, enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the Memorandum of Understanding in, I think, 1974; there was the Executive Council minute of 13 December 1973, which exhorted the late  Mr Connor  to go overseas and borrow $4,000m, part of which was to be used for a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling plant; and, of course, there was the further agreement of 28 October 1975 whereby the Australian Government was to put up 72&amp; per cent of the capital in return for 50 per cent of the profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anybody wants an indication that the Whitlam Labor Government was desperately anxious to mine, export and enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, I think the documents speak for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia there is a great deal of controversy on the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the question of whether Australia will mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that will decide what will happen in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major issues under discussion was naturally that of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the energy shortage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what fascinated me in these discussions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and particularly upon the question as to whether Australia would sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was that only two of the people in this group were anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was also very interested last week to have discussions with  Dr Mabon,  the British Minister of State for Energy, in the Labour Government of the United Kingdom, who came to Australia for the prime purpose of having discussions and endeavouring to get a guarantee that England will have available continuing supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as he has stated publicly, what England would like is a contract with Australia for 1,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> per annum during the years 1982 to 1997. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we work this out we see that England requires a terrific amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote some of the statements of  Dr Mabon,  a fascinating personality, a very genuine and highly intelligent person who has a great concern for his country and the problems that will arise if it cannot obtain a secure supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- something for which it is looking to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Britain would like to buy 1,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a year from Australia from 1982, when its present stocks ran out, until about 1 997. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Australian Labor Party- would see the light and reverse its policy of barring <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales if it won office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that continued supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia were vital to Britain’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is backed by the United Kingdom union congress itself, the members of which I understand are 10 to one in favour of importing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and recently urged their Government to expand its nuclear program in order to avoid an energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am trying to say to our- particularly our trade unionist friends in Australia, is they really must understand that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for us is extremely critical for the well-being of the working people in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that  Dr Mabon  said ‘<span class="highlight">uranium</span> for us is extremely critical for the well-being of the working people in Great Britain’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can see the great need in the United Kingdom for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when one realises that the Labour Party Government in office in that country has sent its senior Minister in the energy field to us to plead not only for a sufficient supply, but also for the support of its counterpart, the Australian Labor <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Brussels, London, The Hague, Paris, Rome and Bonn, as well as in Moscow, I consistently asserted Australia’s wish to develop her own enrichment capabilities so that as much <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as possible should be exported in an enriched form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was what  Mr Whitlam  was saying in 1975: He was not merely supporting the rnining and exportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but was going further and was wanting to establish an enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not convinced as a matter of intellectual integrity of the arguments for leaving <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done nothing about that, except make it more expensive, and in the process, it seems to me what we have done is to forgo the opportunity as Australians to have a voice in safeguarding the world in the processes of the utilisation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That shows clearly what were the views of these men, who went so far in supporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are a few salient points to which I would like to refer, to give the people some idea of what the attitude of the then Whitlam Labor Government was as late as October 1 975, and its views and intentions regarding the mining, exporting and even enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Project shall continue in force during the econoomic life ofthe <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the project area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘economic life’ because the then Labor Government was giving full and total support to the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is that for encouragement, taking this with the collective basket of what I have previously quoted from this agreement indicating the encouragement that the then Labor Government was giving to this Ranger group to become established and to get the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the word ‘each’- be entitled to receive the net annual proceeds of the sale of 25 per cent of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced by the Ranger Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event that in the national interest Australia withholds from sale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced by the Ranger Project, an arbitrator shall be appointed to decide what compensation, if any, but not exceeding world market price, should be given by Australia to offset the adverse financial effect on Peko and EZ resulting from this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again we see the then Government was doing all it possibly could to give encouragement and assistance to those companies to get the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project off the ground and under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  had made it clear and is on record in  Hansard  as saying that he had had discussions with other countries and had spelt out very clearly that the then Government’s intention then was to have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Dunstan Government in South Australia later than 1975-in fact, early in 1977- was still having discussions with the Department of Minerals and Energy in Canberra with regard to the feasibility of the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose the question to the Senate and to the people of Australia: Why has a Party which, when in government, was so actively involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, which conceded so much and gave so much assistance, encouragement and guarantee to companies which were prepared to mine and were desirous of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, suddenly turned around and taken a completely reverse stand following a 45 -minute debate in its Federal conference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the people of Australia will realise what the true situation is and the reasons why the Labor Party, when in government, did so much to encourage the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when today it is opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Labor Party today is opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Labor Party is doing in trying to block- it will not succeed in blocking-the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia is hastening the day of the fast breeder and the plutonium era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, we will encourage the development of fast breeders in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Minister for Energy has made it clear, as have the Germans, the French and the Japanese, that they are concerned that there could be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> shortage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned that Australia might not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and, if this were the case, they would have no alternative but to continue the search for methods to establish fast breeder reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend him for his courageous effort tonight to try to sell the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy and to discredit the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first he described as a tirade of abuse by  Senator McLaren  on  Senator Steele  Hall today and the second concerned <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the other remarks made by  Senator Young  concerning Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been obvious since the date of the election was announced that with the Liberals asking Dorothy Dix questions and the propaganda replies of the Leader of the Government  (Senator Withers)  in an attempt to discredit the Leader of the Labor Party <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be a major issue in the election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals are using the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue to take the minds of the electors off the economy and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the commercial benefits of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> the Labor Party would be anxious to mine it if it was possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Whitlam  signed the agreement with Peko Mines Ltd it was subject to the findings of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and the Joint Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement even provided for suitable compensation if, as a result of these findings, it became necessary to cancel <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were anxious to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  in South Australia was anxious to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> both for the commercial benefits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to meet the needs of the energy starved world which would require it in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  has announced some guidelines which Japan will not accept for the conditions under which he will export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a possibility of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> endangering human life anywhere in the world the Labor Party will sacrifice what Australia may have gained through commercial interests for the sake of protecting human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  was anxious to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He set up his own committee to inquire into the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  was enough of a statesman to say that until such time as we have the knowledge to dispose of nuclear waste without danger to human life South Australia will not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia has decided to use fossilised fuel to generate energy when possibly it would have done better with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but because of the sincerity and the statesmanlike attitude of the Premier of South Australia he is now condemned as a turncoat because of his change of policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  was prepared and anxious to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but after intensive investigation  Mr Justice  Fox could not guarantee that there was no danger to human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  had enough statesmanship and the Labor Party was fair and decent enough and had sufficient interest in worldwide humanity to say that there will be no export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until the safeguards are ensured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s policy is not that it will not mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until international safeguards are guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have an irresponsible Government which is prepared to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party will not run away from the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue looked on the results of earlier gallup polls to be a good issue for the Government to campaign on, but the situation is such today as to make one feel that the support for and against the export of nuclear material is very close to evenly divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day after day we have had honourable senators opposite harp about and chew over the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just say that  Senator Hall  will be replied to every time he seeks to use this venue for the purpose of political propaganda for his campaign in relation to the seat of Hawker and the Government will be replied to on every occasion that it distorts the Labor Party’s attitude to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, which is the most commendable, the most desirable and the most consistent on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, for the purpose of gaining advantage in the forthcoming election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we have been touching upon the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate, I should think also that the electors of Hawker who might carefully have read some of  Mr Jacobi  ‘s speeches on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and seen the quite sensible views that he has expressed on that topic- sensible views that he cannot support in a vote because of the attitude of the Labor Caucus to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- would realise that it would be better to be represented by a man who can vote where his mind is rather than by a man who is forced by the rules of the Labor Caucus to vote with the majority of his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been said in the Parliament’ . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been shown in this Senate over the past week is that  Mr Whitlam  actively pursued the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The list of projects that his Government was to spend all those borrowings on, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span> milling and mining plants, has been produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is seeking to run a scare campaign on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that is simply pathetic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best illustration of how pathetic it is, is for honourable senators to bear in mind the sort of countries that are seeking to buy our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to its reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, Australia is fortunate in having large supplies of three alternative energy sources- natural gas, coal and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the two facts that  Mr Justice  Fox has reported, namely, that there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian propositions that there could be no reprocessing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by those countries without the specific approval of supplier countries and that there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer nuclear safeguards satisfactorily, how does the Australian Government intend to maintain the fictional assurances given to the Australian people that Australian safeguards will be met completely by overseas takers of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I thought that the honourable senator would welcome the views of both the United States and Canadian governments on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reprocessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advent of Australia as a major supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will make certain that Australia’s voice on this most vital problem of international affairs- nuclear weapons proliferation, will be heard . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that a recent report from Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd stated that the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will depend on the rate of growth in nuclear power generating capacity and advances in nuclear technology; that m the United States of America there have been only four orders for new nuclear plants in 1 977, two for tentative preliminary contracts only; and that Howard Winterson, Vice-President of Combustion Engineering in America has said recently: ‘In about two years you will see this business disintegrate’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Button  said, in the last two years or more while he has been engaged on the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry the work which he normally would have performed as Chief Judge of the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to item 05 of subdivision 3 of division 430, which relates to costs associated with guarantee agreements with Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd concerning the borrowing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this cost is associated with the borrowing of more <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know the basis of the cost and whether any information can be given on how the cost of borrowing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is arrived at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another Une in item 05 refers to a ‘Loan to Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could the Minister tell the Committee whether the Government is considering further moves to assist Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd to get out of its financial difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall also have to get the information about the Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We have been accused of being Luddites for opposing the extensive use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the development of certain technology in that direction, so I am on rather flimsy ground if I tend to agree with the honourable senator too greatly on that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that the reluctance by the Foreign Affairs Minister to allow  Mr Justice  Fox to speak directly to the Australian people on this crucial matter- a matter on which the people will be expected to vote in a few weeks time- is serving to confuse the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate and hence cast more doubts by the Australian people about the Government’s policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the trouble is that those flat earthers who are opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are a bit cranky because  Mr Justice  Fox is not saying the things they would like him to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the absence of  Mr Justice  Fox on the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Evironmental Inquiry,  Mr Justice  Blackburn, as senior judge, has virtually been acting as the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a recent report of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd states that by 1980-81 the value of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports could account for about 0.7 per cent of Australia’s total exports or about 1.7 per cent of the total value of all minerals exported and as the Fox report states that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports could represent some 3 per cent of the total exports of 1984-85, rising to 5 per cent by 1989-90, and goes on to say that the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would not be expected to lead to a marked improvement in Australia’s current account in the short or medium term, I ask: To what extent does the Government intend to encourage and support the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is not directed merely at raising money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said time and time again that Australia must go into the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> business if, in  Mr Justice  Fox’s words, we are going to be able to play our proper part in the world and stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am given to understand from a policeman who was involved that policemen and policewomen who approached their senior officer and questioned whether this action would result in a confrontation between the police and people who had a difference of opinion in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were left behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Leader of the Government in the Senate been drawn to the fact that a member of the Government parties has been mailing prouranium material known as ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- Australia’s Decision’ free of charge to school principals in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister be surprised to learn that any number of the brochures contained in the so-called <span class="highlight">uranium</span> kit are available free of charge at Anchor House, the New South Wales Liberal Party headquarters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main policy initiatives we as a Government have taken in the field of energy policy over the last couple of years have been in the areas of mining taxation incentives, energy pricing, the administration of export controls, foreign investment guidelines, decisions on the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and natural gas resources, assistance to energy research and development, and the formation of energy consultative and advisory bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have prepared the way for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and for development of the North West Shelf gas reserves, by the provision of assurances to potential developers and by the appropriate safeguarding of environmental and other interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate relates to a question asked yesterday by  Senator Douglas  McClelland concerning the brochure entitled <span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- Australia’s Decision’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether the Government actually imposed a charge on the Liberal Party for copies of the brochure on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which the Liberal Party in New South Wales is distributing free of charge, but for which the Government charges $1 per copy at the Australian Government Printing Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Those <span class="highlight">uranium</span> kits were produced for members of the Parliament, not members of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man, who olds a vast number of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> shares, wants a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant set up in Queensland but not in Kingaroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether this has been a deliberate action by the Government to prevent Aborigines getting land rights until the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> leases are resolved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers  said in answer to a question yesterday that he would make available tens of thousands of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report kits to people who wanted them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Discussions have been held with representatives of the oil and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industries on the matter, and written submissions have also been received from many of the companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will all royalties collected by the Government for Minerals and extracted from Aboriginal lands be paid into the Aboriginal Trust Account, as required by section 63 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976; if so, what was the meaning of the statement in the paper on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that The equivalent of a royalty of at least  2Vi  per cent will be payable by the Commonwealth Government to the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account for rnining within the Ranger area’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will the Government increase <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development revenue for use in solar energy research, if all royalties must be paid into the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are the arrangements to which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs referred in his statement on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to revenue for solar energy research, the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out in his statement on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development that, as resources flow from the further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, additional funds will be provided to increase substantially our national effort on solar energy research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do the main objections to the Australian nuclear safeguards policy relate to the application of the full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, a ban of more than 20 per cent U308 enrichment, and the requirement of prior Australian consent to re-export and re-process Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Australian Government continue to refuse to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to any countries which will not accept these safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in the House on 25 August 1977, some of Australia’, major potential customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would have preferred a more permissive Australian policy on reprocessing- but we have not received what I would describe as complaints and objections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s view continues to be that the policy announced on 24 May 1977 represents a practical, reasonable and effective package of safeguards measures to seek from countries wishing to import <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (5) The Government’s safeguards policy establishes conditions required to be met by countries wishing to import <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did the Prime Minister state in his policy statement of 24 May 1977 that ‘we would also expect responsible customer countries for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to readily accept our safeguards’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) In my policy statement of 24 May 1977 1 said that ‘we view adequate safeguards as a fundamental prerequisite of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export which we would also expect responsible customer countries for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> readily to accept’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the position is as follows: ( 1 ), (2) and (3) Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Limited (in the ownership of which the Commonwealth Government has a substantial equity) applies, on a voluntary basis, the ‘Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores 1975’ prepared by the Commonwealth Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How will the Australian Government ensure that Aus.tralian safeguards will be completely met by overseas takers of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports, in view of  Mr Justice  Fox’s report of 29 September 1977, recorded in a Foreign Affairs Departmental minute made public on 2 November 1977, that: (a) there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian proposition that there could be no reprocessing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by these countries without the specific approval of supplier countries; and (b) there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer safeguards satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the statement give the lie direct to the oft repeated claim by opponents in Australia to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear energy that there is no known safe method of disposing of nuclear waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Governor-General ‘s opening Speech in this House in which he stated that the Government’s decision to proceed with the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will make a significant contribution to meeting the world’s future energy needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, when is it anticipated that this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be available to those countries which have agreed to the Australian Government’s safety formula for the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for specific energy purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The specific questions which the honourable senator has raised are vital and were taken very seriously into account when the Government arranged its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development policies and specifically when it decided to delineate the Kakadu National Park both for the immediacy and for stages 1 and 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You cannot have a mob of blackfellows sitting on all this <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, silver, lead and bauxite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and land control to demand an independent State . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the mining companies which are kicking up such a row about Aborigines having the right to determine whether <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or other minerals should be mined on their properties, it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has iron ore, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and several other minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present no <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been found in Antarctica but similar rocks to those bearing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia have been found in the Norwegian, Australian and French sectors of Antarctica. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ones in contention at the moment are largely krill, off-shore oil and gas, coal, iron ore, and the possibility of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and other minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although no <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has yet been discovered, rocks have been found in Antarctica that are very similar to Australian rocks which bear <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal control of a vital resource such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could lead eventually to an independent black State in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bjelke-Petersen said the actions of the Northern Land Council in the Northern Territory over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> showed the stupidity of granting mineral rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and land control to demand an independent State- and China or Russia would be eager to step in to help’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate, it is remarkable how the polls have shown a tremendous increase in those people who now feel that it is safer to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground a little longer until we are sure of how we can safely dispose of the waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an area known as Roxby Downs in South Australia, a mining area of great potential both in copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also coupled with these costs are the costs of separating the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the copper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the company is not allowed to sell the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or to process it in any way, of course there will be the added cost of stockpiling the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need at the present time, in order that the company has a satisfactory cash flow, for both of the minerals to be processed to some extent and to be sold- I again name the minerals, copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- otherwise Roxby Downs would not be an economic proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This company has been prepared, as I said, to spend many millions of dollars in exploration costs for  the future development of this highly potential area, but unfortunately the Premier of South Australia is still playing ducks and drakes in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say ‘ducks and drakes’ because, whilst the Premier has been saying many things in opposition to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, he has allowed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration to continue not only around Roxby Downs where there is <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ore body but also in other parts of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a German company known as Uranez which was issued with a licence in August 1977, which was not very long ago- one recalls the Premier was opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when this licence was issued- has been exploring two areas some 30 kilometres from Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> exploration also is going on in the Olary province, as it is called, on Plumbago Station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when  Mr Dunstan  is presenting himself as the champion of anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> protesters and the champion of Aboriginal interests, the revelation that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> drilling is taking place in Aboriginal historic and sacred areas must dismay Aboriginals throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose this question: Why has there been delay for all this time if the State Government were genuine in its opposition to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government is still working closely with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in regard to a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration generally in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then we go further and we find that the South Australian Government established a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment committee in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind- no doubt this will come out some time in the future- that this third report possibly spoke in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the establishment of an enrichment plant in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  is still pressing for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to consider some of the topics which were listed for discussion: Potential for Mesozioc and tertiary <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits; the Stuart Shelf and Torrens Hinge Zone; the mineral potential of Gawler Crater- let us remember that at the present time a German company is exploring for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there- the Olary Province, where as I mentioned earlier a company is exploring also; and the Adelaide Geosyncline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Geologists state very clearly that all of these areas are known to contain substantial deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government has been a client of AMDEL and AMDEL has been carrying out field trials during the past year to see whether the leaching process for the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is suitable for use on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is so opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, why has he used taxpayers’ money for this research by AMDEL? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recall that  Mr Dunstan  seconded the motion on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> passed at the Federal Australian Labor Party conference in Perth last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, he also led the ALP general election campaign on the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ironically, as I understand it, while this was taking place, the Tasmanian Government issued licences for the exploration of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this does indicate the confusion on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue within the ALP at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it perfectly clear that the Labor Party in South Australia originally was in favour of the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was anybody on that committee scientifically engaged on research into aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> et cetera? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, it has been stated that one of the reasons why the State Government is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is the problem of waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the South Australian Government was in favour of the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, technology was not advanced as it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned these matters tonight and have referred particularly to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the attitude of the South Australian Government to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because I am concerned about the future of Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coupled with this, at Roxby Downs there is <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and some reports, though not official, have stated that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs could equal that in the Ranger deposits and that there is sufficient <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Roxby Downs alone, forgetting the other known deposits in South Australia, to justify the establishment of an enrichment plant in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say now that they will change their mindsthey will have to change their minds pretty soon -because no company will continue spending millions of dollars in exploration of an area of great potential- I emphasise the words ‘great potential ‘-if it is to be forced to separate and stockpile <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and suffer all the costs involved in that operation as well as the other costs which are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in a position which would require the establishment of a further township together with the establishment of some smelting works and possibly processing works for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also refer to the battle about the safe handling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘No special medical tests are carried out by the Queensland Railways in relation to its employees who may be handling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the matter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision we must make is whether we sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide to an energy starved world that has already made a decision to develop nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the impression is gained around the place that Australia can decide whether or not the world has nuclear power and that if we refuse to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide to the nations of the world they will change to some other form of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that at $40 per lb for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide Australia has something like 25 per cent of the world’s reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know the extent of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the communist areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide goes to $100 per lb our deposits will represent a mere drop in the bucket because at that price, and with present technology, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be extracted from the greatest resource of all, the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can assume that five per cent is about the figure for the cost of the fuel and the cost of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is doubled it would increase electricity charges by five per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen if the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> goes up because Australia is a non-supplier? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think South Africa would use the bargaining power resulting from its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in order to protect its domestic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we insist upon those people who secure our cheaper <span class="highlight">uranium</span> storing the waste properly we will have done something to safeguard the interests of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, other nations with less interest than us will supply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Our responsibility is to insist that those nations to which we sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> institute safeguards for the disposal of waste products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot do that if we are not selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we will have none if we do not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to an energy starved world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have cheap <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we can do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox said that we should export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a different argument altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about whether we should export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is insisting on secure safeguards for the disposal of the waste by any consumer to whom we sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the most important matters on which  Senator Young  dwelt were the election results in South Australia, and he made a very interesting comment on that subject, and the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, about which he misquoted several things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Young  might have given us some inkling of where they get their funds when he made his speech on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> the other day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that, since the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report was tabled yesterday, he might have regrets concerning some of his statements about the money that can be made out of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to talk about the exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on Plumbago Station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Senator Young  decided to pick out just one mineral- <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- and talk about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> exploration also is going on in the Olary province, as it is called, on Plumbago Station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Young  made great play of the value of the copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits on Roxby Downs; but he did not tell us that at the moment mines in South Australia are closing down because they are not viable; it is not financially viable to mine copper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was basing his whole argument on the fact that we should be mining and exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; that Roxby Downs would be a viable proposition if both copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could be mined there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The world demand for atomic energy and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> itself is becoming less and less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discoveries in South Australia was tabled in the South Australian Parliament on 6 December last year and appears on page 1191 of the House of Assembly  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hudson  answered a question from  Mr Becker  about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discoveries in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Current exploration drilling at Roxby Downs has indicated a very large deposit of combined copper-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> mineralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time has just about run away from me, but in the couple of minutes that I have left I want to make a brief reference to the findings of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission which completely disprove  Senator Young’s  statement about Roxby Downs <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being a great money spinner for the taxpayers of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made no mention of the fact that this very important report should have been tabled in this Parliament last year, before the election, so that people could see that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is not the great money spinner and employer of labour that the present Government told the people of Australia it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the uncertainty of securing supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide from a major producer- Australia- be a major factor in this decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the international concern about the availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies, some countries are turning to sophisticated nuclear technology involving reprocessing and the fast breeder reactor, which would achieve the more effective use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but would increase the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking the decision to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Australia can slow the movement towards the use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel and lessen the attendant increased risks of nuclear weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who oppose or delay the development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are by their actions frustrating the international contribution Australia can make to slow down the movement towards plutonium energy economies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, whose policy is one of opposition to the development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources, and those unions which share the same view, should seriously reconsider and reflect upon the consequences that their action can have both for Australia and for mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a report in the Melbourne  Age  of 21 February relating to allegations by  Mr Keith  Souter that section 4 ( 1 ) of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 could be invoked to make the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a defence project rather than a strict engineering project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister believe that the use of this law would improperly restrict the level of public debate in Australia about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say to the honourable senator is that, as far as I am aware, there is certainly no proposal to invoke the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reported that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has stated that it is anticipated that between 1980 and 1985 there will be a drop in the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> of some 36 per cent from the original estimates of production because of delays and revisions caused primarily by environmentalist groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of” the fact that there are indications that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining may be further retarded because little progress is being made and little agreement is being arrived at between people representing Aboriginal interests, mining interests, government authorities, et cetera, is it now not unlikely that the timetable for future estimates of production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> may also have to be further amended? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of an impasse in the situation will the Government bring the matter before an arbitrator and take whatever action is considered necessary to ensure that stability and common sense are brought to the planning and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am advised by my colleague in the other place that the annual report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for the year ended 30 June 1977 stated that Australian sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the mid-1980s might amount to between 33,000 tonnes and 55,000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there has been some weakening in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market in recent years, this still represents a very considerable level of possible exports by Australia from new mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement to the Parliament of 25 August 1 977 the Minister for Trade and Resources pointed out that the Ranger Inquiry assumed that the production and sale of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would begin in 1981-82 at a rate of 2,000 short tons, increasing to 10,000 short tons in 1985-86. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates and advice of the Atomic Energy Commission were, of course, available to the Government in the course of making the decision in relation to the development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources which was announced to the Parliament on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reported that some 200 to 400 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore from the old workings of the Atomic Energy Commission at Rum Jungle have been dumped at Snake Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall only last year when a certain British Minister came to this country and made certain statements about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well be provocative on the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators must know that the safeguards that have been prescribed by this country both for the use of nuclear materials in Australia and for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> products overseas are the most stringent prescribed by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will know that all this was spelt out in detail in the papers on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which were handed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the nature of the safeguards, I simply direct her to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package put out some months ago when the Commonwealth Government made available to the Senate and the people of Australia its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policies under all the various headings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Region includes stages 1 and 2 of the proposed Kakadu National Park, as well as the projected sites for the Ranger, Jabiluka, Koongarra and Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee took advantage if its visit to hold informal discussions with local representatives of Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd. Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Noranda Australia Limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry second report came out we were told that it would cost $300,000 to rehabilitate that river. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With due respect to the exuberance of all the mining companies, particularly Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd, I think they are inclined to chafe at the bit in relation to retention ponds and the ultra modern method of controlling the impure run-out of water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It conceded that if it were inevitable that there would be some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction it would be looking at Ranger first and at no other mining company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the report indicate that there will be a market for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the 1980s? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Thomas has asked whether the Atomic Energy Commission’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 1977 indicates that there will be a market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My information is that the annual report indicates that Australian sales to the mid-1980s might amount to between 33,000 tonnes and 55,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there has been some weakening in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market in recent years, this estimate still represents a very considerable level of possible sales of exports by Australia from new mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement to Parliament on 25 August 1977 the Leader of the Government in the Senate pointed out that the Ranger Inquiry assumed that production and sales of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would begin in 1981-82 at a rate of 2,000 short tons, increasing to 10,000 short tons by 1985-86. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates and advice of the Atomic Energy Commission were, of course, available to the Government in the course of making a decision in relation to the development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister said to the Parliament on that date, the Government believes that the market outlook provides a basis on which carefully regulated development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources can proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy is being implemented accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, some variations will have to be allowed for if changing decisions are made in the techniques of the handling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy producing fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Northern Territory whether his attention has been drawn to Press statements concerning the alleged secret dumping of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore at Snake Creek in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did this operation involve the removal to a more satisfactory site of 150 tonnes to 200 tonnes of mullock or mining residue which contained a relatively small amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that about late October or early November last year when this ore body was found it was considered, after consultation with the Atomic Energy Commission, unwise to put the ore into open cuts which already are full of ore and which contain contaminants through leaching from the copper ore body and chemicals which were used in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> processing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also considered by the Atomic Energy Commission that it could be well worth while processing the ore when the Alligator River <span class="highlight">uranium</span> field was established and that, as Rum Jungle had become a popular tourist visitation area and was visited by interstate tourist buses, it would be preferable to remove the ore to another site which was under Commonwealth control, as the honourable senator indicated in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently only a small proportion of that area would be <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-bearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the area containing the ore body carries a sign saying ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ore. Keep Clear’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to Press reports appearing today that the retiring ambassador to the Philippines had stated in a conference that there is a chance that there will be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> agreement between Australia and the Philippines at an early date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider that they could receive perhaps a 30 per cent royalty payment on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and so on, we can see that these people whom we are subsidising today will be the millionaires of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister to the alarming figures relating to lung cancer involving people employed in extracting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures put a new picture on hazards involving <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the code that  Mr Street  gave us last year, can we have an immediate evaluation to see just what <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining hazards really mean in relation to cancer in the light of recent United States statistics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was reported in the  Weekend Australian  of 8 and 9 April that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry may not have the enormous potential that miners and the Federal Government are predicting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister in a position to advise us as to whether there is any basis for the report, whether Australia is included in such research and whether it is possible that the speculation as reported could bring about a slump in demand for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that there are a number of theoretically possible processes which might enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and which are described in the 25th annual report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The feasibility of the laser enrichment technique has been demonstrated overseas on the milligram scale using atomic <span class="highlight">uranium</span> vapour, but this approach is complicated by the low efficiency of the required lasers, the high temperatures involved and the corrosive nature of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> vapour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of molecular <span class="highlight">uranium</span> species volatile at moderate temperatures, e.g., <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride, would circumvent these problems, but the lack of suitable lasers and the small differences in the spectral properties of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> isotopes complicate this approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Laser enrichment could affect demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if it could process the tailings from existing enrichment plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unknown whether laser enrichment is commercially possible, whether it can be demonstrated on a pilot plant scale, and whether it is actually capable of separating <span class="highlight">uranium</span> 235 from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> 238 when the  Former’s  concentration is only 0.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extremely unlikely that speculation about a process still in the laboratory stage could affect the world-wide demand for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has provided the most intensive, detailed and stringent sets of nuclear safeguards that any country has provided, for use both within Australia and by countries which will acquire our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are so determined that the highest safeguards shall be applied that not only shall we observe them here but also- I think this cannot be gainsaid -any country which seeks to import our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be subjected to the most stringent regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one so far, even with the maximum conservation of fuel, which is important, has provided a short-term bridging solution to the energy problems of this world other than the use as a primary matter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for ordinary <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the opening of this Parliament on 21 February the Governor-General stated that the Government would be proceeding with the development and export of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The six Bills just introduced underline our determination to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in a carefully-regulated and responsible fashion with full regard for proper environmental control and for ensuring the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those considerations were central elements of the Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development announced on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the specific undertakings given by the Government last August was that we would establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council as one of the elements in the administrative arrangements for control and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has now agreed that the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council be established with the following terms of reference: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council shall be to advise the Minister for Trade and Resources with regard to the export and use of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, having in mind in particular the possible hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy; and the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry in Australia, including exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual individuals to be members of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council have not yet been settled, but the Government has agreed that the Council should include representation from the following groups: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian religious community; the Aboriginal community; a national voluntary environmental organisation; the Northern Territory community; the Australian Council of Trade Unions; a person with experience in energy matters; the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry; a nuclear scientist; a medical practitioner or health physicist; an environmentalist with experience in natural resource development; an economist with experience in natural resource development; an expert in national, and international affairs or law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has agreed that the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council will be supported initially by a group of three research staff who will be engaged by and will report directly to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to advise the House on the stage reached in the implementation of other aspects of the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy announced on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reaching our decisions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development we had special regard to the issues of nuclear nonproliferation and world energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the former, it is very clear that only by developing our vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources can Australia play a real role in strengthening nuclear safeguards and preventing any illconsidered rush to plutonium-based energy systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only as a major potential exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is Australia in a position to command attention and exert influence in the direction of more stringent nuclear safeguards systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, in its position as a major potential <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exporter, strongly supports such nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Australia to achieve progress in the direction of more stringent nuclear safeguards in such negotiations, it needs to be abundantly clear that we intend to develop our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and play a positive and active role in international nuclear developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second major consideration in regard to the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources is our international responsibility as a country rich in energy resources to make those resources available to countries less endowed than ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a significant potential demand for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to fuel existing and planned nuclear energy requirements of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Nuclear Energy Agency estimates that world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves, including those in Australia, are 2.145 million short tons and that the cumulative demand to 1997 is 2.3 million short tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> demand exceeds supply even after counting in Australia’s existing resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the announcement of Australia ‘s decision to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the Philippines, the United States, West Germany, France, Finland, and Japan, have registered their desire to secure <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia for their nuclear power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will not be able to honour those contracts- which are long-term contracts extending to 1986- unless it proceeds with the development of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s credibility as a stable trading nation on whom other countries can rely is therefore very clearly at stake in relation to the undertakings that have been given to provide other countries with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they must have for the production of electrical energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that last August the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development stated that strict environmental controls and standards in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement to the House on 25 August 1977, 1 said that, in addition to proceeding with the development of the Ranger project, the Government would take decisions on the development of other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits, subject to satisfactory completion of necessary requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also mention that Noranda Australia Limited has been designated in terms of the administrative procedures under the Act as proponent of all actions related to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits at Koongarra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to marketing, we said on 25 August 1 977 that we accepted the thrust of the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority be established, but that we would not take a final decision until the implications of foreign anti-trust laws had been fully examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also said on 25 August 1977 that the information available pointed to substantial economic benefits from the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry and that it would wish to consider the accrual of an appropriate share of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> profits for the benefit of the public generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As previously indicated, the Government has initiated discussions with the industry on a possible framework for a secondary or resourcebased tax on future earnings from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> also will be dependent upon the co-operation of those members of the trade union movement who will be involved in mining, milling and transport activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACTU resolutions in the past have identified areas of concern associated with the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTU has called for consultations in relation to the development of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s decision announced on 25 August 1977 to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development has received wide acceptance in Australia and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Development and Export of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> ResourcesMinisterial statement, 1 1 April 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Now that the Government has indicated its intention to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the north, will building of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> town as envisaged in the Fox report commence shortly so as to utilise the well organised construction industry in the area before it is wound up either voluntarily or through financial collapse? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Government be responsible for financing construction of the new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> town? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the planning of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> township is now well advanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Special Trade Representations: Has he seen a report that Australia’s Ambassador to Brussels,  Sir James  Plimsoll, has told the Government that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cannot be used as a lever in attempts to sell more <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the proposed legislation give the Commonwealth full powers to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> anywhere in Australia, or is it particularly in relation to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Ranger in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement introduced by the Whitlam Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the South Australian Premier or his departments still having discussions with the Federal Government on the feasibility of establishing a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the first question, the Atomic Energy Act 1953- that is the existing Act- already makes provision for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the purpose of ensuring the provision of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the defence of the Commonwealth or for any other purpose of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Commission also provide for co-operation with the appropriate authorities of a State in matters associated with mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed amendments to the principal Actthat is, the Atomic Energy Act 1953- will make clear the power of the Commission to engage in the Ranger project in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding dated 28 October 1975 between the Commonwealth Government and Peko- Wallsend Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd. As to the third question asked by  Senator Young,  he will be aware that some time ago the South Australian Government and the Premier showed a keen interest in the question of attracting a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that this morning  Mr Hamer,  the Premier of Victoria, wrote to the Prime Minister complaining in very strong terms about the measures proposed by the Federal Government for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were the States consulted in relation to Commonwealth proposals for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware also that the Premier of Tasmania has requested that no action be taken by the Government in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining until such time as the matter is discussed at the next Premiers Conference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case, am I to understand from the answers he has given to  Senator Brown  and  Senator Wriedt  that he was not consulted in connection with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation that is now before the Parliament, despite the fact that he is the Minister in this place who represents the Prime Minister in relation to federal affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that I, as a member of the Cabinet, took part in all of the deliberations relating to the decisions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is considerable concern in many areas of the Northern Territory community that developmental work in the so-called <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province of the Northern Territory may be held up to such a degree that most necessary work may not be carried out this ‘dry’, the ‘dry’ being from now until about November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been announced previously, the Government is committed to the development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs whether he is aware of the statement made by the Victorian Premier that neither his Minister for Federal Affairs dealing with federal affairs nor the Victorian Government was consulted in the drawing up of the three Bills relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and that the legislation intrudes on State rights, is unconstitutional and centralist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sought that information and I now offer the following advice that I have received: The Prime Minister wrote to all Premiers on 3 1 August 1 977 concerning the Government’s decision to develop a uniform code of practice to apply to all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining activities in Australia and to any future nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit be able to proceed this dry season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement announcing the Commonwealth Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining I referred to our decision to develop a uniform Code of Practice to apply to all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining activities in Australia and to any future nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially, the Code will be developed to cover <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, milling and transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government has decided to accept this recommendation but to go further and, together with the States, to establish by legislation a uniform national Code which covers all aspects of mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as well as any future nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The six Bills introduced by the Government give effect to commitments made in this Parliament last August at the time the Government announced its decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that very significant deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were discovered in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory in the early 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 an Inquiry was instituted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, into the proposal by the Ranger Consortium to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits at its site, some 200 km east of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the incurring of expenditure, by, or on behalf of, the Australian Government and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and other authorities of Australia for and in relation to the development by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in association with Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the Northern Territory of Australia. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The First Report of the Ranger Inquiry, which was tabled in October 1976, discussed the broad issues confronting Australia as a country with rich and plentiful <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report, tabled in May 1977, considered the many issues relating to the specific proposal that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> be mined in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report contained recommendations on measures to ensure that the necessary degree of environmental protection was provided over the full period of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced last August, the Government decided that the environment of the Region would be protected from the consequences of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining through a series of actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To develop a uniform national Code of Practice to apply to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To adopt strict environmental controls and standards in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, honourable senators will appreciate the scope of the environmental protection measures, in a geographic context, by reference to the schedule attached to the Bill which is in effect a copy of Map 3 from the Second Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of honourable senators to the definition in the Bill of ‘<span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very wide range of actions and activities directly associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Region are included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Supervising Scientist are set out at Clause 5, and as honourable senators will see, his role is basically threefold: The first is to collect data on the effects on the environment of the Region of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that these functions relate to the consequences of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining activities in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Co-ordinating Committee are essentially to assist the Supervising Scientist in his role of protecting the environment from the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Co-ordinating Committee is the focal point of the system proposed by the Government for the protection of the environment from the consequences of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the task of the Supervising Scientist, presiding at meetings of the Co-ordinating Committee, to obtain comprehensive and coordinated advice and recommendations which take account of all interests and which have as their primary objective the protection of the environment from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that the Minister keep a list of each Department, Authority, Incorporated Company, or other body that in his opinion has an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is the second in the package of three Bills under the portfolio of Environment, Housing and Community Development which the Government has decided to introduce as part of its policy for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Region also contains some of the largest <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the world- a resource of great economic potential to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry recognised the intrinsic value of the Region, and central to its recommendations was the establishment of a major national park to safeguard these assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioners saw this as the most effective way of minimising the impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on the physical, biological and cultural resources of the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Attorney-General, will be introducing a Bill to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the environment in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, or the appropriate Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of associated Bills are being introduced which result from the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry saw the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council as having a special interest in reinforcing the environment protection machinery in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife or the Northern Land Council, to make orders for the enforcement, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, of environmental requirements which are contained in Commonwealth and Northern Territory laws and in instruments made under those laws, and it gives the Court a wide discretion as to the exercise of this jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Atomic Energy Act 1953 as part of a package of legislation giving effect to the Government’s decision on the further development of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental element of the decision announced in this House on 25 August 1977 was that development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit would proceed on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Whitlam Government and Peko Mines Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Ranger partners, concluded on 28 October 1975 by the Whitlam Government, represents a blueprint for development of Ranger and is a manifestation of the policy of the Whitlam Government for Northern Territory <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement of 25 August 1977 announcing the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> decision, the Prime Minister indicated that this Government is most conscious that the Memorandum of Understanding would not have been our preferred approach to mineral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the Government did not accept the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that the Atomic Energy Act not be used for the grant of authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  indicated in his statement of 25 August 1977 that in reaching this decision the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the Atomic Energy Act would have less force if the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 17 and 34 of the Atomic Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, following the announcement by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977 of Australia’s policy on nuclear safeguards to apply to exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Australia will be entering into government to government bilateral agreements with customer countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, this Bill, together with the related Bills which are being introduced, are a further earnest of the Government’s determination that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia will be carefully controlled and proceed in a responsible manner with Full regard to the need for protection of the environment and the welfare of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be a uniform Australian code covering the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our forthcoming involvement in the mining, milling and transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory underlines the need for responsible governments to have appropriate protection strategies in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore particularly important that this Bill be passed as soon as possible, in view of the imminent development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits at Jabiru, in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their immediate application will be to regulate the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other national codes of practice which will need to be given priority include the management of mining and milling wastes, and transport of yellow cake, in view of the Government ‘s policies for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to act to provide these measures would be irresponsible in the light of the Government’s decision to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation demonstrates very clearly our determination to see that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in Australia is regulated and controlled to ensure the protection of the environment and the health and safety of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government’s decisions on the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of States are interested in the processing of yellowcake for the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New sections are to be inserted after section 23 of the principal Act to empower any person authorised by the land council to obtain information and documents relating either to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region or to the applications made by the lands council to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory concerning matters affecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we are told that Aborigines are to have full access to information relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region but that they can use the information only in such ways as are laid down in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard, it is apparent that in certain aspects of the amending legislation the Government is saying that the promotion of the processing, mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should take precedence over justice, land rights and the very principles of self-determination for the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my purpose to argue, therefore, that the rights of the Aborigines should take precedence over any supposed urgency of promoting a package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would argue that the sacrificing of the rights of Aborigines which could come about as a result of this amending legislation puts their rights at the altar of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention has been drawn to the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice that means that in the case of major minerals such as bauxite, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and beach sands the owner of the land has the absolute say in whether his land should be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be a bad thing for this country that some of the enormous cash flows that 1 believe will be generated from the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry eventually will find their way into the Aboriginal communities which own these northern areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of campaign is being conducted not only in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory; it is being conducted in other places as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that before this Government is many months older there will be a lot of things it will regret about its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Conservation Council urges you to oppose the passage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> packages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite frankly that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ought to be left in the ground until the day we can find some safe way of disposing of the waste and using it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the Government is determined to go ahead with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> regardless of the fact that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had a very short term life as a fuel generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">uranium</span> pill cannot be put in a petrol tank to keep a car moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are lots of ways <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cannot be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to remember that when <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining goes ahead it will transform the whole social and cultural aspects of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government panicked a few weeks ago and decided that that area ought to be cleaned up all the spare <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore was shifted down to Snake Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not know whether the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore will damage streams in the Snake Creek area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It becomes imperative for the Government in its mad campaign to go-ahead to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to legislate for every possible safeguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My forecast is that there will be a time in the future when this Government will be very sorry for having gone into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining because of the pressures applied by the transnational <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining organisations, and by certain people in the Australian community, and the fact that having been compelled to take this action in a hurry it will suffer more pangs of conscience, if it has one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that this is a Bill which gives effect to the Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining as they affect Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those decisions followed from recommendations made by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more important amendments associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will enable the granting of Aboriginal land, which was recommended by the Ranger Inquiry as principal recommendation 5 on chapter 1 5 of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments contained in this Bill which relate to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining are consistent with the Government’s acceptance of the recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry as they relate to Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is generally known, the Australian Labor Party is opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in general, at least at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Opposition were not generally opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, it would still oppose these Bills, especially the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, for reasons which I shall detail later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our general objection to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is based on arguments which I think are fairly well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very serious doubts about whether the guidelines laid down by the Government last year will in fact be enforced by the Government or observed by the countries to which we may ultimately sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the policy is backed partially by the contention that the freer availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- in particular Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- on world markets will remove the need for other countries to move into fast breeder technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is that wrong as a matter of technical fact, but the point is that it is also a fact that conventional fission reactors using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> 238 will produce more plutonium in producing any given quantity of electricity than a fast breeder reactor would produce in producing the same quantity of electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, on the matter of waste disposal I want to make this point: If the Government really believed that there was safe technology for the disposal of nuclear waste and if it wished to maximise Australian control over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which might be exported from Australia it would insist upon- not just allowthe spent fuel rods from reactors being stored in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were done the only <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which would be outside our physical control would be that which is actually being used in a reactor overseas or the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which for six months after that use is in the form of rods which are being stored in the preliminary cooling process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General objections to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or to the movement into the nuclear fuel cycle aside, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill is a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 1 7 and 34 of the Atomic Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australia Atomic Energy Commission in the Ranger Project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall read two short quotations from the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Second Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Atomic Energy Act of 1953 not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the constraints which the Labor Government of the day faced and which this Government does not face, there was always within that Memorandum of Understanding a provision to make the Memorandum inoperative if the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry made particular recommendations and if those recommendations were accepted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we delve back into the history of what happened just 44 months ago it is more than a little ironic that today the Liberal and National Country Parties should attempt to use the Atomic Energy Act of 1953 as the vehicle to cany their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 September 1974, the Senate disallowed regulations proclaimed under the 1953 Atomic Energy Act to provide the basis for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote some of the statements made by  Senator Durack  at that time about the use of the Atomic Energy Act for the purpose of providing a legal vehicle for the commercial exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have emphasised  that  adequate laws already exist in the Northern Territory and in the States under which people and companies seeking to explore for and to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must obtain exploration licences and licences to develop mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is able to come in and take over complete control not only of the development and working of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine but also the exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prescribed substances are <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, thorium and, I think, any substance containing any of the elements with an atomic weight above 93-  -and minerals mined or otherwise recovered in pursuance of an authority under this section that are not otherwise the property of the Commonwealth are, by force of this section, vested in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So  Senator Durack  ‘s objections, expressed in 1 974, were really objections to the principal Act itself, the principal Act which the Government is now using as the linchpin for its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that would give the Government some sort of powers in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which, apparently, the Government would not have over minerals generally throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to be objecting in that instance to the fact that the regulations and the principal Act gave the Government powers over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which it did not have over minerals generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is ironic when one looks at clause 5 of the amending Bill now before the House which extends the definition of minerals covered by the amending legislation to ‘minerals found in association with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this Liberal Party, which said three and a half years ago that it was a terrible thing for the Federal Government to attempt to proclaim rights over minerals other than <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is now introducing an amending Bill to do precisely that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the 1953 Act-  - and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as to its use in the production of atomic weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act itself was coloured by views as to the great strategic importance of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Commonwealth Government has adequate powers in regard to the national interest as far as mining, including the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is concerned under its export control powers generally and under regulations that have been made under those powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the amendment to this Bill broadens even more widely the definition of a prescribed substance to include ‘minerals found in association with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be very clear to any small ‘1’ Liberal members of the Government that the use of that sort of legislation cannot be justified simply to provide a legal vehicle to carry the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the current score is that four or five States have formally protested to the Government, not about this measure but about the legislation associated with the Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that when the Labor Party was in government it set out as fast as it could to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with nothing like the safeguards that are proposed in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no plans whatsoever for the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, apart from the very small use to which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been put over the last 20 years in the production of isotopes for medical purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmentalists, who are sincere on this issue, will point out to  Senator Walsh  and to others that the use of coal can be more damaging to the environment than the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points that is forgotten by the Opposition is that, whether we like it or not, some 27 countries have made a firm commitment to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we did not participate in the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we would be denying those countries energy that they so badly need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, if we did not participate in the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we would have absolutely no control over its use throughout the world, no control over safeguards, weapons proliferation, and all those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking such a firm stand the Government has exerted a tremendous influence over the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some weeks ago I visited Darwin and the site of the Ranger and Pancontinental <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in company with  Senator Kilgariff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During our stay we met representatives of the Northern Land Council, the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd, Pancontinental Mining Ltd, and the Northern Territory National Parks and Wildlife Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We spent one and a half days on the sites of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines and flew back from Jabiru to Darwin, detouring through the beautiful range country around Arnhem Land and Mount Brockman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the Pancontinental mine, which is the richest known deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world, would fit into an area less than one kilometre square, the area covered by this enormous projected mine in the Latrobe Valley is many hundreds of times larger than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project does not get off the ground very quickly we will not be able to meet our present commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Energy Amendment Bill will facilitate joint participation in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 12 months or so many people have spoken, both in this place and in the House of Representatives, on various aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cast aside also their moral responsibility to protect forthcoming generations from the folly of proceeding now with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While questions of waste disposal and weapons proliferation remain, Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits should not be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that people will have different ideas on the problems associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is passed it will be a vehicle to allow <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to go ahead in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My basic and overwhelming objection to the Atomic Energy Act and the amending Bill which is before us is that they will allow <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also there has already been mention of the appropriateness of the use of this Act to control <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us examine some aspects of the Act, which is to be the vehicle for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had to have some legislation to allow <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to go ahead one would not expect that it would be necessary for it to contain the repressive measures contained in this Act which can in fact he used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that, as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia proceeds, dossiers, for want of a better word, will be kept on people who are opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the vehicle for commercial <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should be debating such an amendment to an Act which will be used for commercial production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sometimes have my suspicions about the way in which the Government is using this measure as part of the legislation it requires to enable <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be mined in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One suspects that this measure is being used to suppress public opinion and to intimidate those who oppose <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, when  Senator Baume  interjected, there will be a long and serious battle in Australia against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies that are involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and those associated with it are well aware of what our actions will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as expressing our point of view that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should not be mined, we are expressing a determination that we will not honour any commitment of a non-Labor government until we are sure that the problems associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining are solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we should have the moral responsibility to know that if some problems are not here they will be elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the prospects of nuclear proliferation one should be mindful not only of belligerent nations and governments but also of terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some misgivings about at least one country with which we seem to have entered into an arrangement in regard to our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, one does not need much imagination to consider the possibilities if terrorists use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in a belligerent way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no guarantee that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined in Australia will not end up being used in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if this Government really wants to take an international lead- in some respects the argument being presented about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is that we must take a lead and help the rest of the world- it would be far better off contributing towards solar energy research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span>, if it is used, will not last for ever as a source of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier  Senator Thomas  outlined how he recently went to the Northern Territory and visited the area in which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with a number of other honourable senators I had the opportunity of visiting the Kakadu National Park and some of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines which are outside it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made a point of not only having a look at the Kakadu National Park and the proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sites in the Northern Territory; on a number of occasions I have gone to Mary Kathleen in my own State where <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After having seen all that area I am nowhere convinced that there are no dangers to it if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining proceeds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining proceeds there and the area is spoilt because of pollution effects, it will take millions of years for it to return to its present beauty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw the area during the wet season and I was given a good indication of the problems that could occur if the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> takes place there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two Bills are in a package of some six pieces of legislation which relate directly and in some aspects indirectly to the proposed mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Ranger area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills have come into being because of the Government’s concern to make sure that all aspects of the mining, milling and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are covered by legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are amending the Act to bring it more into line with the present day and, in particular, to incorporate the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically we are debating whether Australia should mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, established by the Whitlam Government in 1975, of which  Mr Justice  Fox was appointed  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He presented his first report, dealing with the physical aspects of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both reports supported the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with certain qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a controversial matter among quite a few people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that when demonstrators so often vocally express their views on the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they condemn the Australian Government and some other governments, but I have yet to see them burning an Eastern European flag or a Russian flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we know <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is being mined, milled, enriched and used for energy in those places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with people in East Germany who have said quite openly that they mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, send it to Russia for enrichment and then get the enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> back to use in their own nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries cannot understand why we are taking so long to mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party at its conference in Perth proposed a moratorium on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One also wonders how many members of the Labor Party deep down are in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that in any derogatory way whatsoever but I say it to show clearly that there is a division of thinking in this country about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that division even exists within the political party to which honourable senators sitting opposite us in this chamber today belong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are many trade unionssome powerful trade unions- that are wholeheartedly in favour, and have publicly expressed that they are in favour, of the mining and the exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> whilst there are other trade unions that are diametrically opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might also have to deal with a few people who may be Labor supporters in the sense that they belong to certain unions affiliated with the Labor Party and yet those unionists themselves and their unions are in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately when <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is mentioned some people tend to become rather emotive and see it in the form of a mushroom cloud going up into the sky, and they recall Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Parker conducted an inquiry into the reprocessing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To go further, anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobbyists also tend to create very emotive situations in the community and at times come out with some fairly hefty propaganda that tends to mislead people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard  Senator Colston  say today that of course we do not have to supply other countries with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; we will not have the trouble with proliferation because, if we do not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it will not arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a world demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and there will be a world shortage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> particularly if we do not supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that will do will be to send up the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, relatively increasing the reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most countries can get <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in their own countries at a price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any coastal state can obtain <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the sea if it is prepared to pay the price, which runs into hundreds of dollars per lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to comments made earlier by  Senator Colston,  the sort of country which might do that would be the country which wanted to make an atomic bomb but could not get any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> any other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week in Canberra the Iranian Deputy Prime Minister and senior members of the Iranian Administration had discussions with some members of our ministry concerning Iran’s requirement of some 1,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heaps of comparisons have been made between <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a normal nuclear reactor 1 lb of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has the heat equivalent of some 20,000 lb of black coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a fast breeder 1 lb of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has the heat equivalent of some 2 million lb of black coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Peko and EZ shall each be entitled to receive the nett annual proceeds of the sale of 25 per cent of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced by the Ranger Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a decision was made to adopt nuclear power and a great number of nuclear reactors were established and proposed to be established throughout the world, a need existed to make sure that a sufficient volume of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was available as feedstock for those nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than express my opinions on whether Australia should mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, in the time remaining to me I would like to refer to other very important comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 1985, France will introduce vitrification processes whereby <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste can be held in an almost insoluble state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great need for us to commence the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a big exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Australia can have a big voice in these important areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said:  lam not convinced as a matter or intellectual integrity of the arguments for leaving <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no one has yet shown that by keeping Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground we would do anything about these dangers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it quite clear that the Australian Labor Party has a policy of total opposition to the opening of any new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines until we are satisfied about the safety of the mining operations and the adequacy of the nuclear safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like to draw the attention of the honourable senator to the fact that in the Memorandum of Understanding made during the time of the Labor Government there was a qualification that subject to the final findings of the Fox <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report, the Labor Government would make certain arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said nothing during the whole of his speech to assure the people of Australia that there is an obligation on his Government to be able to present a clear cut case that the mining in and the proliferation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from this country have been cleared by our scientists so that not only this generation, including the people who will be engaged in the physical act of mining and transporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and eventually treating it, but also the generations to follow will have an assurance that their interests and rights are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time when people are racing around the world holding secret conferences, when the tensions of the world are such that members of the general public are not being fully informed of what is going on and when  deputy  heads of state can visit a country for what are almost clandestine meetings, it can be seen that there is a great deal more in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the future use of nuclear power than meets the eye. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I charge the Government with dishonesty because it has taken the view that it can misrepresent the facts about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples of the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United States have shown the impossibility of being certain that waste resulting from the treatment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be disposed of safely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the sitting was suspended for dinner I had made the point that the haste to mine and treat <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to develop it throughout the world for power purposes had been attributed to the possible shortage of fossil fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that because the possibility of generating power from an alternative fuel has been made economically feasible as a result of the rising cost of fossil fuels, the people who have found a new dimension, because they can obtain <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, develop reactors and supply energy, are taking advantage of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this legislation, and the proposed bulk mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, will create a great deal of turmoil in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who are opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the use of nuclear energy and its consequences, such as the lack of certainty about disposal of the waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worst of all, in the hands of people who are not responsible finally, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could eventually be used to destroy the whole of the earth’s fabric through the use of thermo-nuclear bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the mining and transportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will immediately expose the country around the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine sites to the diffusion of radioactive materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that Australia is being hooked into international nuclear politics in a way that will keep us irrevocably in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite a number of authorities from the United States took part in a seminar on the mining and exporting of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and it was concluded that the matter is far from settled in the minds of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are in a democratic country which has vast resources, amongst which is <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and the Government is making a determined effort to contribute to what could be the cycle for the destruction of the fabric of this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the ratio is probably at least 90 per cent in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and probably a lot less than 10 per cent against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first Bill, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, flies in the face of recommendations from the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, but the Government has decided to use this as an instrument by which the Atomic Energy Commission can buy into the Ranger project and thus we can keep faith with the Memorandums of Understanding that were laid down by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Thomas  mentioned, a few of us have been to the Northern Territory to look at the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province and to talk to the people there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see a lot of problems in this, and I think that the Government should pay attention to it in the future so that the process can be speeded up, so that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining can be started and, more importantly, so that the companies can have one person in the Government with whom they can deal when they have problems to get them tidied up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are rushing into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining I would hate to see us really stalling on any particular subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all is said and done a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine is just another mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all the legislation that we are bringing in to deal with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package, one would think that we were embarking on something that is completely new, something that is dangerous and something that the whole world should be wary of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine is just another mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have explained before, but I guess I will have to do it again, that there were problems in underground <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years on the Continent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined along with lead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there were releases of radon gas and miners died from the results of what they called a choking disease, which turned out to be lung cancer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said this is but a machinery Bill to provide safeguards for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also provide safeguards for anything else that we might want to do with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should look very quickly at the possibility of undertaking our own treatment, our own conversion to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride, our own enrichment, our own fuel fabrication and even our own fuel processing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it has to go either to the United States of America or Great Britain where it is converted into a gaseous form known as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few years ago the French mined some of their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Gabon in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They found that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was not acting as it should in the nuclear reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the French scientists started to do their homework they found that the amount of U-235 in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being mined was from 0.7101 per cent down to as little as 0.42 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just now when the homework is done because it is found that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being mined is not up to scratch that it is realised that this earlier process had taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Justice  Fox would not have felt the need to utter any warnings about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia if he had had the benefit of  Senator Collard  ‘s views on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two Bills before the Senate are designed to facilitate the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no secret that the Opposition opposes <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and opposes both Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic reason for that opposition to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is a commitment in the context of inadequate safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we regard the Atomic Energy Act 1953 as being totally inappropriate to control commercial or civil <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Energy Commission is an inappropriate body to be responsible for commercial <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- the report of  Mr Justice  Fox which  Senator Collard  clearly has not read or has disposed of in his mind as being a totally irrelevant document- stated that the Atomic Energy Act 1953 should not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason is that the Atomic Energy Act, which dates from 1953, contains specific provisions based on the defence power which will offer the Government a means of intimidating and suppressing public opposition to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we believe that the Government is seeking, by means of this vehicle, to have comprehensive control of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining throughout the country and direct government involvement not only in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining but also in other forms of mineral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are some quite substantial and simply stated objections that we have to the use of the Atomic Energy Act as the vehicle for proceeding with commercial <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That must be seen again in the context of the remarks made in the Fox report regarding the inappropriateness of the Atomic Energy Act for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the first extraordinary contradiction in which this Government got itself involved and it is not surprising that it is quite capable of doing the same thing in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a splendid purpose and if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is to take place nobody can properly object to that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential points which I have tried to make are simply these: The debate about the pros and cons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export will go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to face up to that problem as a problem of a democratic pluralistic society and if we are to provide legislation which recognises the fact that we have the pretensions of belonging to a democratic pluralistic society- quite apart from  Senator Collard  ‘s theories about the positive virtues of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and enrichment; the glorious nirvana which he painted for us- this Parliament has an obligation to ensure that the sorts of things which the Governor-General said are not merely empty rhetoric but that we in the Senate and in the other place believe in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that both honourable senators were intending to oppose <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He acknowledged that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could be of tremendous advantage to mankind, subject to certain safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  also gave it away at the finish of his speech when he talked about empty rhetoric, the freedom of discussion and debate and the pros and cons concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that so long as there was an opportunity for the expression of freedom of opinion about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia,  Senator Button  would have no objection to it other than that he would not have used the vehicle of the Atomic Energy Act for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 31 October 1974, the Whitlam Labor Government tabled in the Parliament a statement announcing large scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Northern Territory, commencing with the exploitation of the Ranger deposit, to be followed by the development of the Nabarlek and other deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It facilitates the joint participation in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the other partners in the mining venture at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from page 181 of the report of the first Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for much stricter control over the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and generally in dealing with the acquisition, production, transportation, treatment, processing and storage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, the amendments to the Act would enable the Government to ensure that Australia fulfills its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the handling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As someone said in another place, it seems that the Opposition has developed a psychotic blockage about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, so much so that it cannot see that the people of Australia want us to go ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, and that these Bills and the others which are in the package to come before the Senate later this evening are designed to do just that while protecting the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The export of minerals, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, will help us to pay that bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last December the people of Australia judged whether Australia should mine, mill and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their decision was overwhelmingly in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before doing so and bearing in mind that many of the issues in this debate have already been canvassed by speakers from both sides of the chamber, I want to refer briefly to the comment that was just made by  Senator Lewis  in which he said that the Labor Party appeared to have some psychotic blockage about the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great deal of intelligent opposition all around the world to the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on present trends of nuclear power growth the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will exceed demand by 21 per cent or 21,000 tonnes in 1985, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>World reserves of low cost <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have been upgraded by 48 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining it decided to develop a uniform code of practice to apply to all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is referring to the recommendation relating to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but to go further and, together with the States, to establish by legislation a uniform national code which covers all aspects of mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as well as any future nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assurance I gave in my letter to your predecessor of 3 1 August 1 977, to which you refer was in relation to the development of a nuclear code of practice to cover all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the case then it is most unsatisfactory as consultation should cover the full areas of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development as they affect the States and Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no communication since that time by the Commonwealth on the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that the Acting Premier of New South Wales and other Premiers are seeking consultation, not only on this Bill but also on other provisions relating to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one could not envisage a more important area than the one with which we are dealing- the delevopment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry- in which to have proper consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prescribed substances include <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, thorium or other substances declared to be capable of being used for the production of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of a prescribed substance is particularly wide and the codes could cover beach mining as well as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not just the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with which we are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Premier of Queensland, who seems to get a lot of publicity in relation to many matters, who could not be described as an opponent of this Government, and who could not be described as an opponent of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, had to raise his objections with the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only did the Australian Labor Party in government support <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining but also the  President  of the Australian Labor Party rendered his support to it in principle only last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the world is facing a crisis in energy and the world is looking to Australia, which has an abundant supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, to help to form a bridge in the energy gap which will be created by the rapidly exhausting fossil fuel supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said during the debate so far, and it appears to me to be notable that speakers on the Government side have introduced matters of substance backed up, in my view, by a factual analysis of the important aspects of the implications of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy source to Australia and to a world facing a rapidly increasing demand for energy and a critical - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we on this side of the chamber have said is backed up by a factual analysis of the aspects and implications of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a bridging source of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that between 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the world’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time, not very long ago- a matter of 18 months or so- South Australia was taking the lead in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia incredibly enough established a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment committee and it made persistent representations to Canberra to ensure that the first <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant would be established in the northern Spencer Gulf area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to rationalise our attitude to the emotional matters that are raised by people who are opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment and who, in my view, are opposed to the development of underdeveloped countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter that was brought to my attention at Lucas Heights was the fact that coal mines, particularly underground mines, emit more radon- most mining in the world is underground- and, therefore, this subjects the miners to more radiation than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It talks about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as though it is something that is unique and something that has radioactivity which in itself is a reason to prevent mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not suggest that we ought to stop coal mining or phosphate mining which emit far more radiation than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has ever done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My position on the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been made quite clear many times both here in this chamber and in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer to the rnining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am opposed to the mining, exporting and the transporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and I shall continue to oppose that until such time as adequate safeguards- adequate to my mind- are found to protect the people who work in the mines, who process the rock or the soil and who transport the product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen nothing in either of these Bills that has made me change my mind on the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will allow people to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and allow company towns to be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps after the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has run out we will be able to ascertain, at the expense of your health, the risks that are associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether we are condemning other people to death if we go ahead and mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until such time as I am assured that death will not occur in 20 years or 25 years’ time, I will continue to oppose the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  amongst  all of those we visited the proposed  Ranger  <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining site in the Northern Territory and talked with officials of the company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in passing to the ‘company town situation’ because that is what will apply when the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining gets under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I came away from those meetings disturbed at the methods which were going to be employed by the company to dispose of the water that was going to be used to wash the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> during the mining process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can there be protection of the environment with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the advent of nuclear power that forecasts doom not only for Australia but on a world-wide basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> leaves this country, we have no say in how it will be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that we can ignore the inherent factor of the proliferation of nuclear weapons of war by the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in other countries who do not want us to mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They see the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as the continuation, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can we be talking about guidelines for disarmament at the same time as we are talking about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no bones about my stand on the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world is already aware of a shipment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which went missing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying here and now, as I have said many times previously, that if we mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we must be prepared for the accusations that can be made about us throughout the world that we have been responsible for the proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that we must mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and we must give it to countries to enable them to develop their nuclear power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance she said straight off that there is no interest in energy in the Third World and that we should have no concern for ensuring that it gets <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the development of its own industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons that my colleagues have been outlining throughout the evening, I support <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those steps include the package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills now before the Senate and the agreement with the States to establish a program for the implementation of the National Energy Advisory Committee’s recommendations on energy conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate at the outset that I do not believe that any mechanism, any Act of Parliament, the most repressive regulation, the greatest fine, the longest gaol sentence or any line drawn on any map can protect the health and safety of the people of Australia when the mining, milling and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, as far as the Opposition is concerned and as far as the Party to which I belong is concerned, the only real safeguard at the present state of knowledge in the world is to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of this country are becoming more and more disturbed as more and more facts become available on the problems associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assertion made yesterday by  Senator Lewis  that the people of this country voted at the last election for the mining, milling and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government believes that the people of this country voted for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, I challenge it to hold a referendum and to ask the people of Australia how they feel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Government will not do that because we know that it is as conscious as we are of the fact that half the population of Australia is against the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because we do not know enough about the effects which will result from the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More and more people are concerned that once we begin to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, once the nuclear industry starts, we will have no way of stopping the effects which may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very nature of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> raises questions in the minds of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very recently in Melbourne 200 scientists, scientists who are concerned with the physical effects of radiation, urged the Government to go cautiously in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining because of the potential risks of radiation, including genetic damage and the danger of cancer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the results of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to release radon 222, a radioactive gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been calculated on the basis of current theories on radiation induced illness that 400 deaths will occur among future generations from the mining of sufficient <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to produce that 1,000 megawatt years of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radon gas is given ofT by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a steady rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not seem to be the same urgency to make sure that those things are done before <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining commences as there is to bring in this repressive legislation which will prevent people giving this sort of information to other people once <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has now been established in America that among <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners there are five times as many deaths from lung cancer as there are among nonminers because of the inhalation of radon gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is so important it is obvious that nobody will stop the company going underground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So then Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners will run a five times greater risk of dying of lung cancer than nonminers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the code for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining-  would lessen the dangers and extent  or  cancer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hunt  assures the country that there is no risk involved in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, that there is no risk involved for the miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So evidently, as the Government does not know, it does not care what will happen to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health records of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners in Australia either have been lost or have never been kept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not believe that that is an example of a government showing concern for the problems in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The General Accounting Office in America has reported that thousands of pounds of plutonium and enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are missing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that all that was needed was five tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and a cascade of dozens of centrifuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is continually being slung at the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party that at one stage we were in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and that we did an about-face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know now that we cannot combat the difficulties in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and nuclear industry to which the Government shuts its eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say: ‘Until the problems can be solved, we will not sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to fine or imprison people who hinder <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we only mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia or are  Mr Anthony’s  plans to enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> here further advanced than we have been led to believe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not going to tell us, yet we have this extraordinary legislation just for the simple mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada had trouble with the contracts with the embargo on enrichment, and Canada had to let go her embargo on other countries enriching her <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be easier and more profitable to enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the problems that these countries have with the disposal of waste, would it not be useful to have a waste’ disposal facility to offer to countries to entice them into signing contracts for our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only conclusion one can reach, when the Government brings in this sort of repressive legislation, is that the Government does not intend to just have simple propositions for mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only assume that the Government will go further, that it will enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and that it will offer waste disposal facilities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not true why introduce this extraordinary legislation for the simple commercial operation of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason for not doing so is that we might not approve of the safeguards, and the 50 per cent of the Australian people who do not approve of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at the moment might also not approve of the safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion 1 can do no better than to quote from the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry where it looked at the use of the Atomic Energy Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to us that s. 4 1 is a special power which was enacted at a time when the need to secure Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for use by Great Britain and the United States of America in nuclear weapons was uppermost in the minds of those concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in part because it is proposed that the Commission be actively engaged as entrepreneur, and in part because one of its ordinary roles is the promotion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear development generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central difficulty for present purposes is that they belong to an organisation whose function is not simply one of research; it is also an active commercial and political force in the promotion of nuclear development and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole rationale adds weight to the Labor Party’s contention that we should open no more <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines and that the only proper way to safeguard the people of Australia from the difficulties, dangers and confusions that arise in this industry is to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that it was the Whitlam Government that made the decision to carry on with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in this country; it was the Whitlam Government that drew up the Ranger agreement and entered into partnership with the companies involved; and it was the Whitlam Government that set up the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in order to discover the best guidelines for the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has followed the guidelines set down in the Fox report for the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills before us have been drafted for one express purpose, even though they may have an effect in the future, and that is to expedite the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually the Labor Party found itself in a dilemma with half of its members wanting to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and half of them not wanting to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we get right down to tin tacks, the decision is really whether we should or should not mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that if we do not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, somebody else will supply the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing about it is that if we do not export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we will have no say in nuclear safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing is that if we do not supply the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> our main competitors in the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, such as South Africa and Chile, will supply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what the Australian Labor Party is actually doing, by its policy and philosophy, is helping the exporters of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Africa and Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that some people seem to have that Australia has the monopoly on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is absolute nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do have a large proportion of what we might call ‘cheap extractable <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’, but a lot of other countries have <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for which the cost of extraction is a lot higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I explained here some time ago, we have approximately 25 per cent of the world’s known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if the price remains between $30 and $40 a lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it increases to $ 100 a lb our resources will not mean a thing because the greatest resources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world are in the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that with present technology <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can successfully be gained from the sea at a cost of $ 100 a lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if we want to have some say in what is going on overseas we must be able to export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to keep the price down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I think it was  Senator O’Byrne  who brought in the subject of Hiroshima and claimed that because of what happened in Hiroshima we should not have anything to do with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that we must export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to an energy-starved world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said previously, if we do not do so other nations- I mentioned countries such as Chile and South Africa- which might not have the same interests as we have and might not demand the same safeguards as we would demand will supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in our place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only that, the economic advantages to this nation of exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are tremendous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be a completely stupid concept that we should leave the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground while everyone else is using and producing their <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that if we do not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world and keep the price down to a reasonable figure of $30 to $40 a lb-if the price goes up to $60 or $100 a lb, whatever it might be, because of a shortage of cheap extractable <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- all the nations are going to turn from the ordinary power plants as we know them today to the breeder reactors and will be using plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest, as most of the gallup polls have suggested, that most Australians, whilst naturally being worried about safeguards and the like, are completely happy about our exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provided, as I said, there are sufficient safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made much play of the allegation that the Whitlam Government gave the goahead to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- the Fox report- and a whole host of other evidence indicates that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at this point in history can indeed be a very dangerous operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have said- our policy remains this way- is that existing contracts should be honoured but that there should be no more mining until there is an assurance and scientific evidence to indicate that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste in particular could be safely stored and that there would be no proliferation of weapons or misuse of nuclear by-products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many areas, his statement did not present the full facts associated with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and in other cases it contained considerable distortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the opening of the Parliament on  2 1  February  1978,  the Governor-General stated that the Government would be proceeding with the development and export of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when I was in the Northern Territory last  year, it was obvious that the green light had been given to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners to go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  six  Bills just introduced underline our determination to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in a carefullyregulated and responsible fashion with full regard for proper environmental control and for ensuring the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows that members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party are hawks on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are to commit Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world nuclear fuel cycle; to mine and sell off the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as quickly as possible: and to control the growing Australian opposition to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that fails it will stand ready with the full repressive force of the police state tactics enshrined in the Atomic Energy Act, which the Bill now before the House seeks to amend, to suppress openly opposition to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> go-ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government does not care a damn that the proposed future pattern of economic development in Australia, with emphasis on mining for export, of which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be a significant part, will mean fewer jobs and lower standards of living for the working people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my State of Queensland, the Premier and his political police did a fairly good job to make sure that there were no demonstrations by those people who do not  believe in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the specific undertakings given by the Government last August was that we would establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council as one of the elements in the administrative arrangements for control and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has now agreed that the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council be established with the following terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I read the terms of reference into the record, I want it to be clearly understood that apparently the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council will be an organisation without teeth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it will be a prettying up job implemented for the purpose of popularising, if one could use that word, the Government’s policy on the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council shall be to advise the Minister for Trade and Resources with regard to the export and use of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, having in mind in particular the possible hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy; and the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry in Australia, including exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual individuals to be members of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council have not yet been settled, but the Government has agreed that the Council should include representation from the following groups: The Australian religious community , . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the person selected from that community be one of those who believe that the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is essential for the economy of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Australian Council of Trade Unions will be represented on the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that if the Government finds someone who is in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> he will make the ideal representative so far as this Government is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there will be a representative of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be keen competition amongst the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners as to which one of them will be the representative, and none of them will be any good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of them have been mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for so many years that it does not matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of doctors in this country say that it is safe to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many conservative economists in the country who say that if we do not mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we will go bankrupt, so no doubt the representative will be one of those. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has agreed that the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council will bc supported initially by a group of three research staff who will be engaged by and will report directly to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reaching our decisions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development we had special regard to the issues of nuclear non-proliferation and world energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the former, it is very clear that only by developing our vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources can Australia play a real role in strengthening nuclear safeguards and preventing any illconsidered rush to plutonium based energy systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only as a major potential exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is Australia in a position to command attention and exert influence in the direction of more stringent nuclear safeguard systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, in its position as a major potential <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exporter, strongly supports such nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More countries are involved in the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> than the two that were referred to by  Senator Maunsell  a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the other reasons this Government has used over the past 18 months to justify the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is needed to produce power in the underdeveloped Third <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are neither the facilities nor the requirements in those countries for the use of nuclear power, and if the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners are able to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it is very doubtful whether they will be worried anyway about the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people are joining the Labor Party in its attitude that we should leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground until we know what we are doing with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a significant potential demand for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to fuel the existing and planned nuclear energy requirements of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Nuclear Energy Agency estimates that world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves, including those of Australia, are 2.145 million short tons and that the cumulative demand to 1997 is 2.3 million short tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> demand exceeds supply even after counting Australia’s existing resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the announcement of Australia ‘s decision to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the Philippines, the United States, West Germany, France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finland and Japan, have registered their desire to secure <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia for their nuclear power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A member of the British Parliament stated when he was in Australia a few months ago that Britain wanted Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More authoritative statements have been made in Britain that they do not want the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At lease three of the countries to which I have referred have either scaled down their requirements or decided that they do not need <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as urgently as they thought they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, suppose that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was going to contribute to the rectification of the power shortage throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not need the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia because of our coal and oil resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To tell people in this country and in other countries that we need to sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because of the employment it will generate is also untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are worried about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, realising that the expertise will have to be imported into t he Territory and that the mining will provide very lew jobs to alleviate local unemployment, which stands at something like 15 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opening of vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits for mining purposes is totally unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer now to a Press statement authorised by  Dr Joe  Camilleri on behalf of the Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining, released on 1 1 April 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excessive secrecy and a lack of public accountability will characterise government administration of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy if the bills introduced to parliament yesterday become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, the government would be empowered to declare codes of practice to protect the environment and health and safety of Australians from the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and other nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, clause 14(1) (d) of this bill ensures that the government can suppress any information relating to the environment, health and safety standards at <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is so determined to go ahead with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the utmost safeguards must be implemented, as I said in a debate which took place in this chamber yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whose fundamental charter is the promotion of the nuclear power and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Government intends to forge ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development with scant regard for public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining believes that this hastily drafted legislation ignores the growing doubts, worldwide, at a government level about nuclear safety and economics, and the massive global citizen opposition to nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that this legislation is designed primarily for one reason, namely, to facilitate the movement of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the earth to those areas at which mining companies and, to a lesser degree, people associated with this Government can get their ample rewards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its provisions are very harsh and sharply contradict one aspect of the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend against the use of the Act -  that is, the Atomic Energy Act-  for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if mining were approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By conducting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining under this Act, the Government has the power to deny the ordinary industrial rights of  workers and unions associated with the mining, handling and transportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, it prohibits free speech and demonstrations against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person can be fined $1,000 to $10,000 or gaoled for six to twelve months for doing anything that hinders or obstructs the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an industrial dispute at any stage- I mentioned this aspect a moment ago- in relation to the mining and transportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, for example, over wages, work conditions or safety, the Government can use the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The use of the Atomic Energy Act to cover <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining now makes it an offence for any worker, union or Australian citizen not to comply fully with the mining and the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1977 attacks on the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> movement were stepped up by the Premier of Queensland under the cover of parliamentary privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Deputy Prime Minister in his speech referred to the decision which had been made about Canada being a safe place for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Canada has agreed to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Europe and allow reprocessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada’s agreement will make it difficult for Australia to impose any tougher conditions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales, notably prior consent before reprocessing or enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement does not give Canada the tight control over the end use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that  Mr Fraser  claims will apply to Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So if Canada, long an exporting nation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is unable to do this, how will Australia be able to set standards which arc tight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Australian Joint Intelligence Agency has expressed reservations about selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Westinghouse has made a settlement with three of the 27 utilities suing it for repudiating contracts for the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A local survey taken in Kalgoorlie, in our own country, has shown that most people are against a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> pilot plant being established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how much panic the Government is experiencing in its grim determination to go ahead with the legislation to enable <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to commence as soon as possible and to be part of the social and employment pattern of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all let me make it quite clear that I am totally opposed to the mining, processing and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite  Senator Jessop  ‘s comments about the relative levels of radioactivity of a glass, of wine and the Lucas Heights establishment, I must confess to feeling far more confident having my nightly glass of wine in the parliamentary dining room than I would be in any association with the mining, processing or marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or <span class="highlight">uranium</span> derivatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste disposal, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the potential for terrorists activities are all possible, indeed probable, areas of danger inherent in the mining processing and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the  Sydney Morning Herald  this week the column of  Sir Mark’s  headed ‘Question Marks over <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> ‘ contained the following comments: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ores contain a gram or more of the daughter substance of the slow radioactive decay of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, radium, together with all the subsequent radioactive substances it produces, including the gas radon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If scientists of the eminence of  Sir Mark  Oliphant and others have these worries, worries which  Sir Mark  Oliphant concludes by pointing out are solvable but only under highly expensive economic procedures, I wonder that the Government is still seriously considering proceeding with the mining, the processing, and the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in sailing blindly ahead with the large scale mining, processing and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, even though there is no definite empirical evidence, wine notwithstanding, that the associated dangers can be minimised much less eliminated, the Government is coming perilously close to being justifiably accused of putting economics and economic considerations before the health and welfare of present and future generations of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that I oppose in principle the use of nuclear energy, the mining, processing and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, I want to go on to point out one or two other areas in which the Bills are contentious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This package of Bills is concerned with the implementation and effecting of the Government’s policy for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining development in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been variously described in second reading speeches as honouring the Government’s ‘undertakings to the Australian people and the governments of the States and the Territories’ and as being a carefully controlled and responsible measure for developing Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not in the slightest degree equipped by education or experience to pass a judgment upon the issues to which  Senator Haines-  adopting the views of others as well as speaking for herselfhas referred with so much concern but I have tried to follow them and I have formed my own judgment in the light of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and the debates that have been held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a highly strategic material, the supply of which involves not only questions concerning the hazards and problems we have been discussing, and trade considerations, but also foreign policy and defence considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in the Northern Territory see the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> quite differently from the way in which people in other parts of Australia see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people in Australia think that we are on the threshold of making a decision to mine and develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been tremendous debate on the matter, there have been the reports by  Mr Justice  Fox and there has been constant discussion on how and when we will commence developing <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have lived in the Northern Territory for a while realise that Australia has been developing and mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1950s the development and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> commenced at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which mining was developed in those days with undue care being taken in the handling of basic metals- I am not talking about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- resulted in the deterioration of the country and pollution of the river. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain things should be done when developing a mine, whether it be for copper, zinc, lead or any other mineral including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> was mined in places other than Rum Jungle which is near Batchelor about 65 to 75 miles south of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rich little deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was developed over the years at Moline out from Pine Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been expended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is from these various sources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that have been mined over the years that Australia is now fulfilling its contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must appreciate the fact that Australia has been selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for quite a while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to 28 October 1975- the Australian Labor Party was in power at the time- when it was decided that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be developed with the participation of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government actually became a partner in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are waiting for the Government to go to the directors’ tables at Ranger, Jabiru, and to have discussions with the Northern Land Council and other interested people in order to reach agreement so that the mine at Ranger, Jabiru, can start mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as quickly as possible to fulfil the contracts that the Australian Government made a few years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It confuses me considerably how the Labor Government could have made these arrangements when these days members of the Labor Party make so much noise about not mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Haines,  who is not present in the chamber at the moment, is one of those very genuine people who have fears about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and we must respect that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some other people who do not want to see the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have views which I do not respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These countries, which the people to whom I have referred follow so enthusiastically, are seeking and mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the same people do not want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have very many friends living at Batchelor, one mile from Rum Jungle, who have worked and lived in this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They actually mined <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- I am going back 20 years- when the potential danger was not realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They mined <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under very casual conditions and were exposed to radioactivity, yet to me they seem to be very healthy people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we should not develop in our minds this tremendous fear that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is the metal that will bring about this horror of terrorist activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to broaden the principal Act so that the Atomic Energy Commission can participate in the Ranger project and so that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining can proceed under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The powers of the Commission are to be extended to include minerals found in association with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While all the news is about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> I would point out that there are some very hefty gold deposits associated with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not accepted the recommendation of the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry that the Atomic Energy Act should not be used as a vehicle for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Northern Territory has to participate in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and under this legislation it will participate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the development and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> these days one must remember that Australia ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 23 January 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The safeguards are what might be called a code of ethics and the Australian Government will only sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to countries that measure up to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that countries that want our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but which are refused access to it because of our code would not be placed in a difficult situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulties are going to arise in the sale of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are we going to be the seller of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; in respect of the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we are also going to be a judge of the morals of the countries to which we sell the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement which I released today relates to actions which are being taken now with respect to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills which are before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following my announcement, supported by the Country Party Senate group and other Liberal senators to vote against some aspects of the proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation because of lack of Northern Territory participation, I visited Darwin with Rt  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The talks were put in some jeopardy by the fact that the Labor shadow Minister for the Northern Territory,  Dr Doug  Everingham, intruded into the discussions by sending a telegram to the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council in the midst of the discussions indicating that Labor would support the Land Council and not support the proposed amendments to give the Northern Territory participation in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before dealing with that amendment I wish to comment briefly upon the speech made by  Senator Kilgariff,  who singled out  Senator Haines  from the rest of us who oppose the legislation as a person who has an honest objection to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure  Senator Haines  has an honest objection to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, but I am not sure that  Senator Kilgariff  is in a position to speak about the rest of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff’s  suggestion that the Australian Labor Party is somehow involved in an international conspiracy in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining exhibits a 1948ish mentality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the week’s adjournment of the Senate I hope  Senator Kilgariff  will contemplate the fact that the Soviet Union has exactly the same policy on the mining, export and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as the Fraser Government has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator knows that the position of the Whitlam Government on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was subject to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the position of the Fraser Government on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is not subject to the Fox inquiry because the conclusions of the Fox inquiry have been ignored in the two Bills which are now before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, the point I was concerned to make was that one would have thought that there would have been some degree of consistency in a Commonwealth government’s attitude towards the States in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining- in relation to the development of the mining industry as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that without these regulations the Commonwealth Government has already ample powers to ensure the national interest in the exploration, conservation and orderly development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources aware of Press reports today of a study which apparently warns of a risk to Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am advised by my colleague in the other place that he has seen the news report of a study of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports and the alleged risks to those exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by my colleague that I can assure  Senator Kilgariff  that the Government is firmly resolved that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will proceed on a carefully regulated and controlled basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that Australia will become a major exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have your telex advising of your wish to proceed with the environmental nuclear legislation with the objective of giving the Commonwealth appropriate powers to administer the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining development in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 can appreciate your desire to  press  on with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the whole basis of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, processing and marketing in Australia was intended to be tied to meaningful Commonwealth-State consultation and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that in fact it does not behove this country to stand apart, to leave the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground and not to exercise an influence on the protection and handling of nuclear energy and nuclear fuel throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry basically justifies our going ahead with nuclear endeavours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend against the use of that Act for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is one of the co-venturers with private companies in the use and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in part because it is proposed that the Commission be actively engaged as entrepreneur, and in part because one of its ordinary roles is the promotion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear development generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed an article this morning in the Melbourne  Age  by  Mr Tony  Walker, the Canberra correspondent, headed <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Law Threatens Civil Rights’ in which he made many points in respect of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  wants to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and sell it at the highest price he can get, irrespective of safeguards, he will do it no matter what this Government says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has introduced into Parliament, a series of Bills relating to the mining and export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed legislaton raises many serious and fundamental questions, not only about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and related nuclear acitivies, but also about the established rights and responsibilities of the States in a number of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and all matters concerned with nuclear development are of such importance that they must be subject to the most careful and comprehensive examination, including adequate opportunity for general discussion and debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two principal advisers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which is one of the lowest income earners in this great continent there are two principal advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is proof in black and white of the priorities of this Government, which are the mining and the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> without any regard to safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its highest priority is to look after the mining and the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to get the mighty dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can see dangling in front of their noses the dollars which they hope to get from the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the very disturbing facts is how this Government has tried to hide its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote some of the questions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> I posed to the officers of the Department of Trade and Resources on 4 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could you tell us what the rationale was for creating a separate division for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which comprises only a small part of Australia’s mineral earnings; for placing agricultural products and some minerals, copper, tin, lead, zinc, gold and tungsten in another division; and placing the major export earners coal, iron ore, bauxite and alumina with nickel and mineral sands in a third division? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He replied:  1 think it was an attempt to support the Government policy in regard to minerals, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in effect, the Government is giving the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> its No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officer had said that the restructuring of the Department was to safeguard and promote the Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked what safeguards this Government could tell us it had in operation if it got the go-ahead to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as it is hoping to do, and provided this legislation were passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 4 May 1978  Senator McLaren  sought information regarding <span class="highlight">uranium</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time it speaks in public about safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it tells the people at large it has adequate safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if the Government has adequate safeguards they must be an improvement on what was contained in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package of statements that was put out as Liberal Party propaganda during the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet one of the Government’s supporters asked a question today as to why the Australian Government Publishing Service was charging $5.10 for a small booklet on safety procedures- not a booklet on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but a wee booklet on safety at a cost of $5.10. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government distributes free of charge a package of information on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at enormous cost to the taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is another example of the priorities of this Government in trying the hardsell on the community on the safety of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document headed ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- Australia’s Decision NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS’ is a background paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If u country buying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia were to fail to comply with its safeguards obligations, there are a number of sanctions which can be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seeking agreement amongst other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> suppliers to do likewise, action in the United Nations or the IAEA against the country involved, and termination of diplomatic or trade relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once these mines are fabricated, because of modern machinery no great work force is needed to mine the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my guess is correct and the Government gets the go-ahead to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> I would like to know how much of the machinery will be manufactured in Australia to mine this wonderful product that will bring in this great income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned how the departments involved with the safety of mining and the disposal of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are scattered around like shrapnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the responsibilities of these two principal advisers in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> division? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One division is associated with the domestic aspects of the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s policy on commercial development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other division is concerned with the international aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports, both present and future, and international conferences on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you refer to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package presented in this Parliament in August last year you will see that a large number of departments are involved in the whole issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Trade and Resources, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Department of National Development and the Department of Health are all concerned with aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is not just <span class="highlight">uranium</span>  simpliciter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you wish to worry about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste you will have to go to the Department of National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is clear evidence of the way this Government is giving every honourable senator who is concerned with the safety aspects of the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> the run-around when we try to pin it down and ask it to tell us what real safety measures it has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already a proposition has been floated- the Government has not denied it yet- that if we sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when the Australian Labor Party’s policy was to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but we have been prepared to change and we admit that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government raced in and gave the okay for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore have no hesitation in saying that I am in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it clear that, whilst I am strongly in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, I cannot let the decision to proceed be made with legislation of this character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the background of these Bills, it is worth reminding the Senate that last year the people and the Parliament had before them the results of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in two volumes, styled the First and Second Reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again subsequently, the Fraser Government decided that it would proceed with the mining, milling and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the decision to mine and mill <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, and to market it abroad, has been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inevitably, although the debate on the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had been extensive, the debate on these two Bills, although not strictly relevant was, on the part of the Opposition, one which went over again the whole question whether one should mine or mill <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or market it abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are important but to put it in perspective and because of the Opposition’s approach to this matter, I should remind the Senate that the Ranger Environmental, or Fox Report said certain things regarding the mining, milling and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, the Fox Committee was commenting upon the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again, the Fox Committee was reporting on the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did so, of course, against the background that it is not currently the intention of the Australian Government to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, or its attendant fuels, for the generation of nuclear power in Australia in the contemplated future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But indeed it is important to Australia, because we are our brothers’ keepers, that we should know what are the safeguards of other countries using that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the generation of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we do not think that the waste situation is at present such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it is plain that the situation demands careful watching– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that this risk alone constitutes a sufficient reason for Australia declining to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to point out again the danger if the plutonium content of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be used for fissile materials for nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important contribution of the Ranger Inquiry also directed itself to whether or not Australia could influence the world if it decided not to mine, mill or market <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will set an example to the world and this will limit the dangers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Fox Commission directed its inquiry to was the fact that the world is energy hungry and is being forced to look in the short term at least towards <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as fossil fuels dry up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a danger that if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is supplied to the world without the most stringent safeguards the very dangers that we all fear could occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If by denial of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world for use in slow water reactors we force nations through scarcity to turn <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to plutonium which can give indefinite sources of energy, we then by our action lead them, even incite them, into making fissile materials for nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can intrude one side comment, it is to say that it is strange tonight that those who in the days of the Whitlam Government sought to earn dollars for Australia by the mining and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in conjunction with a big company now see errors in our doing exactly the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are walking within the stated policies for the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who claim that they do not want to mine or market <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have no monopoly upon the desire to safeguard and protect the people against radiation and against genetic mutation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who follow the rules outlined by the Fox Committee in mining, milling and marketing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have the great responsibility and the enormous privilege to enter the world market and demand of the significant number of countries which will take our fuel that they observe our safeguards which are regarded as the most stringent safeguards in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are part of a package of Bills which have one major purpose, that is, to enable the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government clearly intends to proceed with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> regardless of the consequences to health, the environment, the Aboriginal people and their aspirations for land rights, civil liberties and world peace and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that Bill which gives the go-ahead to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining through the setting up of machinery which involves a grave erosion of civil liberties in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other four Bills are regulatory Bills purporting to regulate the operations of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and health issues raised in the two Fox reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill purports to provide the administrative framework for monitoring research and control of the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reviewing the quantity and quality of pollution to be released by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, the Ranger Commission decided that a completely different outlook to mining company proposals was needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is trying to foist on the Australian people the contradictory concept of a national park that contains hazardous and destructive <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining sites within its region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we genuinely support the concept of the Kakadu National Park, because we genuinely want this unique, exotic and highly significant region, part of which is to become Aboriginal land, to be protected from despoilation, we strongly oppose any and all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining within the catchment area of the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 23 February 1978  Senator Button  asked me a question without notice relating to the siting of a nuclear reactor in the Philippines and whether it is the Australian Government’s intention to make <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available to the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Philippines will be an eligible customer for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provided it concludes the necessary bilateral safeguards agreement with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the radio program  AM  this morning there was a report that the  chairman  of Pancontinental Mining Ltd has asked the Government to intervene in the financial talks between Pancontinental and the Northern Land Council with regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development and that that Council has now said that in view of this action it is unlikely that Pancontinental will be able to commence work at an early date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone who participated in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- that would include bodies such as the Australian Conservation Foundation- obviously obtained, even from other witnesses, an insight into what was contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister shall cause to be prepared and kept a list setting out the name of each Department, authority, incorporated company or other body that in his opinion has an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly that imposes an obligation on the Minister to include on the list any body or organisation which, in his opinion, has an interest in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to consider programs for research into, and programs for the collection and assessment of information relating to, the effects on the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those duties are directed to looking after the environment of the Alligator River, not the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister shall cause to be prepared and kept a list setting out the name of each Department, authority, incorporated company or other body that in his opinion has an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not those who have an interest in the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region who are to be listed; rather it is those who have an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservation organisations of Australia have been pursuing a protest concerning the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the committee is to comprise, in addition to possibly the scientist and the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, 1 8 other persons who represent mining interests, one can appreciate the fears of those who oppose <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read clause 18 (2) as indicating, in plain words, that conservationists and environmentalists would be deemed bodies that would have an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not read ‘an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations’ as referring only to the narrow commercial exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; rather that it includes all interests, including those related to possible detrimental effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The coordinating committee has an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in terms of its positive and negative effects as well as its environmental effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he thought the word ‘interest’ applied to many people other than those engaged in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that the word could be applied to people who were opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that if, in my innocence, I were to get a notice from an official and I knew full well that I had 100 units of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that this was contrary to the law of the land, and if, thinking that I would tell a lie, I said that I had only 50 units, I would be punishable under clause 27 and subject to a $1,000 fine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the collection and assessment during that year of information relating to the effects on the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as I said when I spoke last night on other legislation, all that people in the Northern Territory- people like  Senator Kilgariff-  want to do is to get control of the mining interests in the Territory so that they can exploit the situation to the fullest and get every dollar they can out of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining for their mining company friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision in this Bill for consultation on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining with the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my remarks on that provision during the second reading debate I quoted from an article which  Sir Mark  Oliphant wrote for the  Sydney Morning Herald  published on 9 May 1978, in which he described the effects of radon gas, which is one of the inevitable consequences of the milling and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Jessop  made a claim which I believe seriously misrepresents the position of  Sir Mark  Oliphant with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall,  Senator Jessop  claimed that he had had a conversation with  Sir Mark  Oliphant and  Sir Mark  Oliphant was not opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and did not consider it hazardous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He told me that he was opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he was against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  main reason for opposing the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reactors was not based on health considerations but rather on proliferation considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to correct the misrepresentation made by  Senator Jessop  with regard to the position of  Sir Mark  Oliphant who is against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and against the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These three Bills are a part of the package of Bills that the Government has brought before us to enable <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is, of course, opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not been successful in our opposition to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill which in fact permits <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we continue our opposition to the three Bills before us now because, although they pur.poit to provide machinery and measures whereby the environmental and hazardous effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining can be controlled and regulated, we find that the provisions are not satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we strongly oppose any and all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining within the catchment area of the Alligator Rivers Region within the Kakadu National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot accept the concept, as embodied in this legislation, of a national park which will have three <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate to one particular consequence of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the area- the production of radon gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague  Senator Melzer  in an earlier debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> spelt out in great detail the nature of radon gas and its disastrous consequences in all sorts of ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ores contain a gram or more of the daughter substance of the slow radioactive decay of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, radium, together with all the subsequent radioactive substances it produces, including the gas radon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now growing evidence in the United States, as told to the Congressional inquiry in February last, that those who have been in contact with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, for instance in mining, in reactor operation, and in the maintenance of nuclear reactors for submarine propulsion, may develop  leukemias  and other forms of cancer, 20-30 years after initial exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very anxious to see the declaration of a national park; that is, one free of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our reason for wishing the Federal Court and not the Northern Territory Supreme Court to have jurisdiction over these matters is that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a national issue and the regulation and control of it should be a matter of national responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation enabling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to proceed is a matter for the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view the same laws and the same interpretation of those laws regarding the regulation and control of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining should apply throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A whole new body of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> law is being developed at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view there should be a single federal court with access for all concerned citizens to deal with breaches of the law relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous  speaker, Senator Ryan,  referred to the emission of radon resulting from the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The radon liberated during coal mining and superphosphate mining, for example, is far in excess of the quantity of radon that is liberated as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Sir Mark Oliphant does not regard the mining or processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be hazardous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is on record as saying that there are no problems associated with the mining and processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some 30 trillion cancer doses under the surface of the United States- the deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and its daughters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the large amount of information on the presence of various radioactive isotopes in different parts of the human body, plus some other well known information, it has been found that the mean number of Americans killed by ingesting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or its daughters from natural sources is 12 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that three areas of the Kakadu National Park have been excluded as potential <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My fear is that even if we placate the mining interests with the three suggested <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining sites that will not be the end of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘That means that we will never have access to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said you can extract your <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from desolate regions of Western Australia and you will not get involved with the conservationists who want to protect the Alligator Rivers system ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not a Doomsday man; I am simply saying that without adequate soundings we do not know the full extent of the impurities from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations which the river system will have to accept in flow offs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the recent NSW Coolong limestone deposit dispute it is thought desirable that the Bureau of Mineral Resources might seek to encourage <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration in more arid regions of the Territory where conservation conflicts would be at a minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That early discussions be held with the Minister for the Northern Territory on methods and standards which will bc applied to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations to ensure effective anti-pollution safeguards: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, I think that the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry recommended that water impurities be not released for three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> outside the national park itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also heard a lot of criticism from other countries about the strict, rigid terms of the Government’s guidelines for the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually it was found that this was due to the presence of radon gas from underground <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about opencut mines, and I become weary of the antiuranium lobby which keeps saying that these things are dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the report of the Windscale inquiry conducted by  Mr Justice  Parker in England, a document to which I have referred previously in debates on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern at the moment is that the community can be misled by statements about, as some people would put it, the lack of concern, where it is proposed to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory, for the protection of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, there was concern that it was perhaps taking too long, that there was great delay with regard to the overall aspects of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the Government had accepted responsibilities with regard to the overall aspects of the environment in the whole <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the Government was also very conscious of the need for environment protection generally speaking and for safeguards and guidelines with respect to the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one can only say that the members of the Opposition are nit-picking or playing a game of political charades because what they should be doing with their attitude on the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is standing up and saying: ‘We oppose the lot’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge members of the Opposition- not that I will support their proposed amendment- to say that if we were to accept their amendment they would accept the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the vote on the second reading of a previous Bill was taken two members of the Liberal Party crossed the floor and sat on the other side, not because they were opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but because they were concerned about certain aspects within that proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have seen is members of the Opposition proposing certain amendments when in reality and truth they are opposed in totality to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is despite the fact that the Government of South Australia stands publicly and states that it is opposed in totality to the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enrichment is Stage 3 or 4 of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore this discussion on the feasibility of the establishment of an enrichment plant is purely for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia, in particular from South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that State Government has the audacity to send telexes to State senators of South Australia and also to stand and say that it is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also aware that on top of this the Mines Department in South Australia, an agency of the State Government, directed by the State Government, was a client of Amdel (Aspect) Pollution Consultants in South Australia doing research at South Australian taxpayers ‘ expense on the exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the leaching process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the South Australian Government still stands and says that it is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that in South Australia the green light has been given to a predominantly German firm to explore for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within 30 kilometres north and south of Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to that aspect on another occasion when we were debating <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is sincere about its opposition to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> why is it permitting very extensive exploration activities on a proclaimed historic Reserve? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the difference is that we are standing up and dealing with environmental aspects, openly saying that we are in favour of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the South Australian Government says that it is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that it is opposed to doing so many things in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>over 1,000 drill holes have been put down since August, pits have been dug to bury unwanted samples and to store <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for testing purposes, thus rendering the earth sterile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is talking about a government that is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but which, to quote her, has allowed over 1,000 drill holes to be put down specifically for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, not for other minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that I am expressing concern but am not condemning the South Australian Government for one moment for the exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the State Government is conducting these activities without saying to the public what it is doing, although it says that it is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Minister goes on to refer to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> minerals within the host rock- I will not read the earlier verbiage in the letter because it will take too long- and spells out that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is the specific mineral to which the State Government is referring and the specific mineral for which the companies are exploring, hoping that they can exploit it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it does not contravene the Act, but who is in charge of changing the Act to make sure that it does if there is concern about the environment and about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of leaching upon the aquifers are being studied in the Kalkaroo area to the north of Plumbago, and in Texas where the Texas Pollution Council has undertaken detailed studies on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> leaching over a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>should noi significantly impair the quality of the groundwater within the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that we are discussing environmental aspects of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Ranger area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government has been looking at means by which it can leach <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground- in other words, put it in a solution form and get it out of the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Minister for the Environment has said that it should not significantly impair the quality of the ground water within the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not stand up and openly oppose the whole package deal on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the South Australian Government’s claims it has put down 1,000 drill holes to enable it to study a process whereby <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be leached out of the ground, bringing it out in liquefied form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has openly stated that it will mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with stringent safeguards, both with regard to the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and with regard to the conservation aspects of the environment in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government is saying that it is opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; yet it is going ahead and encouraging exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt I will be criticised and condemned by some of the members of the South Australian Government for standing up and supporting the Federal Government in the stand it is taking with this package of Bills in relation to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government is conscious of the fact that there is a need to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, for  Senator Young’s  benefit, I will repeat that we are against all mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean that that is the only area in which we are opposed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one beautiful moment I thought he was in a fine fury because he was appalled at the fact that Aboriginal sacred sites were being polluted and that testing in connection with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Australia was endangering the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Jessop  stated that there was more danger from radon gas in the mining of coal or superphosphate than there would be in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has said it will bring into being and enforce precautions in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the area of the Northern Territory about which we are talking in order to protect the miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that  Senator Jessop  take another look at Jabiru, where the Pan-Continental company says it will mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should remember a conversation with an engineer about how deep the mine will be and how the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will still be there, going under the hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that it would be much cheaper to mine it underground than it would be to remove the hill to get at the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not tell me that once the mine is open they will not continue on the seam and continue to take the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out underground because there is nothing in this legislation to stop them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he has convinced those authorities about those particular problems, perhaps he will then start on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners who, at the moment, have a five times greater chance of getting lung cancer than other people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is not because they smoke cigarettes; it is because they mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although they have said that under some circumstances they will agree with mining at Jabiru, they have also said that if this Government is determined to go ahead with mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they would like to see the smaller site at Nabarlek taken up first so that they can have a first hand look at the results of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in any circumstances’ we know from talking to many of them that they really want the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> left in the ground despite the riches which might flow to them from the mining of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that more than half the people in Australia want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> left in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are thousands and thousands of people in the world- the number is growing all the time- who want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> left in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, at the behest of mighty mining companies, sees the profit that it thinks it will make from mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and it wants it out of the ground, no matter what sort of havoc is wreaked in doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report, which the Government loves to quote out of context and by no means fully, in part states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining uses a lot of water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Canada energy authorities are worried that radioactive water will seep into the town and city water supplies from disused <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even our own Atomic Energy Commission has reported that demand for Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the mid-1980s will be drastically down on past estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we have to get the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners believe that if they do not get it out of the ground and sell it now they may never sell it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries are finding that the costs of producing energy from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are too high and that the other consequences that may come from using it are much too high to take a chance with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not doubt  Mr Fry’s  integrity but I believe that he is committed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons I believe that is that throughout the past two or three years in debates in Victoria on the pros and cons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on many occasions  Mr Fry  attended those debates as the adviser to the mining companies who were taking a pro-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that he is committed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, he will see any dangers in a lesser light than people who are not so committed to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It comprises nominees from federal departments of a government committed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It has representatives of mining companies who are committed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that the first accident will bring to a head the resolve of the Australian people to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> alone- to leave the Park whole and untouched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Government is not prepared to bring in regulations which would make the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> totally safe and which would put the onus on the miners to prevent any pollution whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that it is going to be impossible for them to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there without there being danger to the miners, to the environment and to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking literally about the future of humanity when we agree that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the future of humanity and its heritage when we talk about endangering the Kakadu National Park by allowing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in any portion of that Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should not mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those people who believe that we should mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can take the time to ensure unconditional safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, because there is no shortage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- as the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners know only too well- we should leave this area undisturbed in its splendour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having heard the various statements she has made over the past three quarters of an hour, all of which state that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining should not take place, I should like to ask her one or two questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, I must point out that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia was first proposed when Labor was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We pointed out that the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam),  who was the then Prime Minister,  Dr Cairns,  who was the then Treasurer and  Mr Connor,  who was the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, made an agreement with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd and other people for the development and the ultimate sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This agreement was made some time ago when people knew less about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> than they do now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very odd situation, to say the least, that during a debate such as this honourable senators opposite come into the chamber crying poor when some years ago- as I said, when people knew less about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> than they do now- they were looking for the riches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it- I exclude the honourable senator from the expression I am about to use- that the ‘greenies’ are concentrating on the Northern Territory- the area in which, naturally, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be mined- and ignoring the other parts of Australia where immense projects which are to take place will destroy the environment and may result in ill-effects for the communities near those projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the haste in the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> areas in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone really criticise the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package that was introduced into Parliament several months ago? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very complex and complete plan of action in which the environment is safeguarded and in which the mining and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it would be true to say that the safeguards that the Australian Government has introduced for the mining and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be the most advanced of any country in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator obviously has visited various parts of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has cited what happened at Rum Jungle as a good reason why <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining should not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What really happened there was that there was a casual approach to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> itself did not cause damage to the country or pollute the streams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a matter of the administration of the mining and development that took place at Rum Jungle 25 years ago when Australia first started to develop, mine and sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator feels so strongly, why on earth did he not attempt to get the Labor Government to take action when it was in power and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was taking place in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, the complaint that I had in the last two weeks was about the fact that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> outlined in the package that was presented some months ago to Australia and the world totally excluded participation by the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have more to say next week on the stage of self-government that we are now entering, but I would say now that, having brought Kakadu and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry into being, we must ensure that whatever we do we encourage the people of the Territory to live and work together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that for the next three years the contracts made a few years ago by the Labor Government to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to other countries will not be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the insertion in the Bills of these numerous points the Government will ensure that the people of the Northern Territory will, to the degree promised in the course of various conferences, correspondence and so on, have some say in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that if she has been to what we call the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province she would have seen this site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less than one per cent of the land area of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province will be disturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say once again that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package overcomes the problems there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly support the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and particularly the three Bills now before us because they give recognition to the Northern Territory and enable it to play a part in its administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are part of the sequence implementing the Federal Government’s decision to mine and mill <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for marketing outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inevitably, the debate has been not so much on these Bills at all as upon, as with yesterday, whether <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ought to be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, Opposition senators have argued that it is wrong to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because mining companies will get profits and make a dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sadly there has run through this debate the polarisation of the argument that the protection of the people of Australia and of the world against radiation and genetic mutation and destruction is best achieved by not mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reminded the Senate yesterday, as I must do again today, that the Fox Committee report indicated that there were very large dangers to the safety, security and survival of the people of the world if Australia failed to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under proper safeguards and instead allowed the proliferation of plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Fox Committee said, and it is the authoritative body, that with proper safeguards the hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could be properly contained and were quite tolerable within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know that some concern has been expressed about the role which the Northern Territory should play in the development of that plan for the Alligator Rivers Region as a consequence of the Commonwealth Government’s decision to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by once again thanking honourable senators for their contributions, by reminding them of the significance of these Bills as part of the total development, by reminding them of what the Fox Committee said in all these matters and by reminding them that we are moving into the general orchestration of the Fox Committee in the light of the statement by that Committee that if we had proper safeguards it would not be improper to proceed with the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia has jurisdiction, at the suit of the Director or of a Land Council, to make orders for or in relation to the enforcement, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  sub-clause ( 1 ),  leave out ‘at the suit of the Director or of a Land Council, to make orders for or in relation to the enforcement, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region’, insert ‘at the suit of the Director, the Supervising Scientist, a Land Council or any person or persons whose interests are affected by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region, to make orders for or in relation to the enforcement, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region, ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After sub-clause (1), insert the following new subclauses: ( 1  a)  An organisation of persons, whether incorporated or not, shall be taken to have interests that are affected by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region if concern with the environment in the Region is a matter included in the objects or purposes of the organisation or association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(IB)  Sub-section (Ia) does not apply in relation to a particular happening, incident or transaction occurring as part of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Region if the matter occurred before the organisation or association was formed or before the objects or purposes of the association included concern with the environment in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from the wording of the two amendments that it is our intention to widen access to the jurisdiction by including persons or groups which have a legitimate interest in the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially, the Government sought to impose upon the States a uniform code of practice relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, the Commonwealth has completely abdicated from its responsibility to impose standards of safety on the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consequences of that, as  Senator Walsh  pointed out, would be simply that, in dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, to put it somewhat bluntly, the Government of Victoria could request that a code be proclaimed which would apply to that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of Queensland- and let us not beat about the bush- might have a different view concerning safety requirements in connection with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as it believes that those laws should apply, that any laws which the Federal Parliament is empowered to make in relation to those matters should not be made because it asserts a prior right, it can say the same thing in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines should be strictly regulated and controlled, for the purposes mentioned in Chapter 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not need to go to Chapter 16 because that deals with the question of the hazards of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policy respecting Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports, for the time being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of that production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence could be that, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, potentially there could be a different standard in relation to safety codes in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue was a matter of such concern that the States should cede their powers in that regard to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is attempting to apply those principles in 1978, when we are dealing with the nuclear power industry and with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a ridiculous situation, because whatever wisdom the Founding Fathers had, it was not of the kind which would have helped them understand the Fox report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of widespread concern both in Australia and in the world, the Government has, on this fundamental issue of the importance of safety codes in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, backed away- in the pursuit of some peculiar notion of its own, derived perhaps from Montesquieu and Adam Smith about the nature of the separation of powers and the desirability of having regard to the views of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to our recent correspondence on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation currently before the Parliament and to the meeting of 18 May 1978 between State and Commonwealth officials to discuss the State governments’ concerns about the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officials indicated that the States saw these particular Bills as raising the possibility of Commonwealth intrusion into areas of State responsibilities in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear energy, that the Bills were seen as being of doubtful constitutional validity, that their passage raised the issue of constitutional impropriety with the Commonwealth resiling from its cooperative federalism policy, and that the Bills lacked specific arrangements for Commonwealth/State consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes untrue the statement, set out in a large booklet, as to what the Government would do if the country gave it permission to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is only one of the Bills needed to assure Australia that the safeguards that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  promised in return for the right to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that a particular danger may exist because of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in one State, the Governor-General cannot take action unless he is requested to do so by a State Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should say that the Commonwealth cannot control <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining; perhaps it is better left to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some doubts about whether some of the States at some time or another will insist on the safety provisions required for mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If radioactivity results from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it may have not only a local effect but also may extend beyond the border of the particular State in which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in parts of Western Australia could have deleterious effects on parts of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it would have deleterious effects on parts of South Australia and not on the metropolitan area of Perth, it could well be that the Western Australian Government would be more satisfied with profits from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining than with the safety of South Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are putting an embargo on it, despite the fact that the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining might be poisonous to part of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs in South Australia might be detrimental to the whole of South Australiait might be detrimental to the environment and to the health of the people- and the laws in South Australia do not provide the necessary protection, whether or not the laws of the Commonwealth provide the necessary protection, the Governor-General cannot do anything about it unless the State Government asks him to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I admit that I am not a legal man, these provisions may be necessary in accordance with constitutional rights, but if they are necessary we have to admit that the Commonwealth Government cannot protect the environment from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining unless we first get a uniform code of agreement which all States will observe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Premier of Queensland could not care less about the safety code so long as he can mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and get dollars for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can we do in Western Australia where there is a person, Lang Hancock, who publicly states that there is no danger at all and we ought to be mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as fast as we can go and selling it as fast as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So where will safety come into it in those two States in which we know from past experience the two Premiers could not care less about any safeguards as long as they can dig the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground and sell it for money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could not give a hoot, nor could Lang Hancock who is on record time and time again as saying that he has come in close contact with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, he has flown over it and he has as good as eaten it and it has never affected him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has even said- he repeated it here a few moments agothat the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> safeguards are split among a series of divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I posed questions in my search for information during the examination of the estimates for the Department of Trade and Resources I found that there are seven divisional heads, two of whom are responsible for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat, this Government has the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue scattered round this country like shrapnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there anything in this legislation which will prevent the re-entry into Australia of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that the Commonwealth will permit the return to Australia of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste from overseas for burial or disposal in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing code of practice in relation to radiation protection in the mining and milling of radioactive ores excludes or does not apply to the mining of ore that contains less than 0.02 per cent by weight of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and less than 0.05 per cent by weight of thorium, that has not within it at least a radon daughter concentration in excess of 0.33 wasting level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor does it apply to a mill that produces concentrates that at no stage of milling contain more than 0.05 per cent by weight of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or thorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arose from a common root, that we do not believe that there are adequate provisions either for specialist advisers on the conduct of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling, or for adequate public disclosure of the conditions which may be laid down and the practices which are being followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purposes of the amendment were, firstly, to require that before the GovernorGeneral made any orders pertaining to the mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there would have to be a public inquiry and, secondly that the findings of that public inquiry would have to be reported to the Minister administering the Environment Protection Act of 1974 prior to any such order becoming operative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, this clause grants to any State the power to veto within that State codes of practice that the Commonwealth may lay down for the mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, the Government is saying that there will be no codes relating to the mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, no minimum standards of safety or environmental protection, unless the State governments impose them or unless the State governments agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out to the Senate that all the States at this moment have to some greater or lesser degree a code of practice regarding the handling of fissionable material, the handling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and its products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that very recent precedent, one would not have to be unduly suspicious to fear that if the Queensland Government does something similar with respect to codes of practice for the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, this Government will likewise go to water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, I think the Commonwealth has a direct and almost exclusive- if not exclusive, predominant- responsibility to ensure that there are proper codes of practice and proper laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the famous kit of documents on nuclear safeguards which the Government put out in its thousands- I referred to this last week and I shall have to refer to it again- it made great play of the sanctions which it could enact if a country which was buying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia were to fail to comply with the safeguard obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said last week, Lang Hancock has gone very close to saying that there is no danger at all in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our words are being twisted to say that we are opposed at all costs to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From all the comments made by the people in the mining industryparticularly by the leading miner in Western Australia,  Mr Hancock,  who is most outspoken on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- one realises that they could not care less about safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some States will have virtually no immediate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction; other States will have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, those negotiations did not have the dangers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong, at the time that we are passing a whole lot of Bills which relate to the commencement of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in this country, for the Opposition to hold up the legislation unless a uniform code is reached by all States on environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The purpose of the insertion of new Part IVa relates in a sense to a judicial and constitutional point which is simply this: Assuming the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 is passed and proclaimed, the Commonwealth Government will be given paramount rights over the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A licensing provision in codes or regulations could not in itself authorise <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 50 of the Act provides for wide powers of detention, search and arrest without warrant, which are extreme measures in relation to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that the oftenmade comment that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will erode civil liberties, as has been made by many honourable senators, is quite accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, these objections which I raise to sections of the Atomic Energy Act which will be used in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at Ranger clearly illustrate the contradictory stand on civil liberties by the Government and the use of extreme powers, which were employed in the Cold War period of the 1 940s, with respect to a commercial development in the late 1970’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in many of its aspects is a bipartisan issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister confirm a report in yesterday’s  Age  to the effect that the Italian Government’s energy conglomerate, Ento Nazionale Idrocarburi, wants Australia to help plug a multi-billion dollar gap in its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister also confirm a further report that a mission from ENI came to Australia for talks with the Government and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, Italy has a need for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the generation of electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Italian Government delegation visited Australia during March and April and had discussions with the Government and private companies in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supply and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions were held on the safeguards conditions and arrangements which Australia would require to govern <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports to Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we understand the position, Italy has secured most of its supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> up to about 1983, but thereafter it has a requirement for further supplies and it looks to Australia to satisfy some of those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with Australian Government policy and subject to the completion of satisfactory safeguard arrangements, the Government looks forward to establishing a secure, stable and long-term relationship with Italy for supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to satisfy that country’s energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In support of its aim for industrial development in South Australia, the South Australian Government in 1 975 set up a Committee on <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee was charged with preparing a report on the general applicability and feasibility of establishing commercial plants for the manufacture of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride and for the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on a South Australian site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this project would provide a tremendous stimulus to sadly flagging industrial development in South Australia, can the Minister say whether  Mr Dunstan  has abandoned the race for such a plant and is allowing the enterprising Court Government in Western Australia to beat him to the punch on the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment facility? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that in the report there is evidence of a study by the South Australian Government and I am aware that there was at that time and subsequently enormous interest in South Australia in the possible development of an enrichment plant to produce <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament will recall that the Government announced on 25 August 1977 a comprehensive policy for the further development of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy was based on the findings and recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry conducted under the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s decision, as announced on 25 August 1977, to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development has received wide acceptance in Australia and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy was decided only after most careful consideration of the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry laid particular stress on the orderly development of our vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of those resources, whilst serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment, the welfare of the Aboriginal people and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Central to this aspect of our policy is the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement of 25 August 1977 the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  stated that the Government accepted the thrust of the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and that we would establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority or similar marketing arrangements to achieve the objective of orderly development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he made clear that in the arrangements we made we would ensure that the Government had at all times proper knowledge, oversight and control over the arrangements under which Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That control would always ensure that the Government would be in a position to move immediately to terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against the above background the Government has considered carefully its attitude in regard to the machinery which should govern future exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and I shall now explain to the Senate the decisions we have taken at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is presently controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations of the Customs Act 1901. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> exports are prohibited unless a certificate in writing under the hand of the Minister for Trade and Resources, or an officer duly authorised by him, is produced to the Collector of Customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures we intend to adopt flow directly from the Government’s determination that exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will only be permitted in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering exports we will have regard to the principles I have already stated, some of which I now repeat briefly, namely: The orderly development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources; making supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available to other countries for use in the generation of electricity and for other peaceful purposes; ensuring adherence to the policies of Australia in relation to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the application of safeguards against the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> other than for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also desirable that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers should be informed of the way in which that discretion will normally be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s approval for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from a particular project will be given only after full consideration by the Government following the completion of environmental procedures and compliance with the Government’s foreign investment policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say now, however, that Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission will be permitted to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the latter from the Ranger deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the Ranger deposit were the subject of arrangements which the Whitlam Government entered into with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd. Our Government has previously stated on 25 August 1977, when approval for Ranger was announced, that the arrangements between the Whitlam Government and Peko-EZ would be honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the various considerations of national interest I have previously mentioned and the diversity of our deposits, it will be necessary for the Minister to exercise some control over the quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being exported at any one time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be necessary that the Minister determine in advance that the contracts which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers propose to enter into for the sale of their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to overseas buyers contain appropriate terms and conditions consistent with Australian Government nuclear safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will also determine terms and conditions relating to the duration of the contract, the quantity of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be sold under the contract, the method of shipment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the price payable for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the manner- including the currency- of payment, and the use to which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be put by the purchaser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> producers will accordingly need to seek the approval of the Minister before making any firm offers or entering into any legal commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a contract has been entered into in accordance with the requirements that the Minister has notified beforehand, the producers will be required to lodge a copy of the contract with the Minister, whereupon it will be formally approved and form the basis for subsequent export approvals covering the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be exported in fulfilment of the contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shipments of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will continue to be controlled, as is the case at present, on the basis of individual consignment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will not issue a certificate under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations in respect of any consignment unless all aspects of Government policy are satisfied, including: That the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is being exported from a project which has the status of Government development approval; that the export is for the purpose of performing an approved contract; and that Australian safeguards policy is fully complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to the Government’s previously stated view that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority or similar arrangements should be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body would be appropriately named the Australian <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Export Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I envisage that at the appropriate time in our progress with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export authority should be established to be charged with the duty of advising the Minister for Trade and Resources on the matters I have just outlined in relation to exports under new contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an authority would also carry out a number of important ancillary functions namely: To assemble and to correlate information relating to the known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and in other countries; to obtain and analyse information on the supply of and demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and other countries; to analyse trends in the international <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market; and to obtain information on the commercial arrangements for the upgrading and enrichment of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within and outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authority would also liaise with, and provide information to, the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that in view of the nature of the advice that the authority would need to provide, it would not be appropriate for its members to be chosen from the companies which were participating in the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The machinery and the procedures I have just outlined will ensure that the Government maintains strong regulation and control over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports in the national interest in a manner consistent with the Government’s policy of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development announced on 25 August 1977 following receipt of the Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a statement which claims once again that our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy is based on our obligations as a responsible member of the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  policy is to dig up <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as quickly as he can and sell it as quickly as he can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As usual the policy statement that we have just heard ignores these events and creates the impression that the Australian Government is desperately keen to press on with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at any cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important recommendations of the Fox Report was that there be sequential development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ignoring the recommendation on sequential development will have two effects: Firstly, there will be competition between the various producers to get their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> onto the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will disrupt the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and is likely to result in Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being sold at artificially low prices while producers struggle to get long term contracts overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the rejection of that recommendation will result in substantial damage being done to the Northern Territory, and particularly the Aboriginal lands in the vicinity of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the various countries which are in the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have very different requirements and will be putting different pressures on the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While on this issue, I should mention that it is becoming increasingly clear that  Mr Justice  Fox, Australia’s Ambassador-at-Large, is becoming disenchanted with the prospects of obtaining adequate safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese have just entered into a contract with Britain to reprocess American <span class="highlight">uranium</span> without obtaining the approval of the American Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, it is unrealistic to believe that Australia can control reprocessing of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these matters raise major objections to the line the Government takes on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement proposes that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export authority should be established to advise the Minister on a range of matters dealing with export contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will assemble information dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves, it will seek to analyse trends in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketparticularly future supply and demand- and it will be involved with commercial arrangements on a number of aspects dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such an authority was recommended by the Fox Report and, with a substance such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is no doubt very necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some ways it is a pity that this authority is not operating at present as it would be able to advise the Government that in view of the substantial downturn in the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits should be on a quite different basis to that contemplated by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An aspect of the Minister’s statement which is more worrying is that part which deals with the control of the Minister over the terms and conditions to be included in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement points out that the Minister will determine the duration of the contract, the quantity to be sold, the method of shipment, the price payable and the use to which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is a real worry that if the Minister is determined to get as much <span class="highlight">uranium</span> onto the world market as possible, he will take a very lenient view about any of these matters and not exercise the control which is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard the Leader of the Opposition this morning commenting on the paper produced by the Acting Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  entitled <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Export Policy’, which is a ministerial statement of today’s date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory will suffer as a result of the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer to what  Dr Helen  Caldecott  had to say this morning on  AM  about the Prime Minister and his policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest emphasis is placed on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department has two divisional heads looking at the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> question- two principal advisers- one concerned with development and the other with export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are more concerned about finding overseas markets for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is referring to protests against the mining and selling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course she is well aware of the problems that may exist if we start mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia without necessary safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We spent three or four days in debate recently trying to extract from the Government what safeguards it intends for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is about to sell all the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the open market, all of which will be used to make atomic bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said in the debate on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills that this is all the Government is concerned about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document from the Department of Trade and Resources proves that the Government attaches prime importance to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government investigate the truth of the assertion made by a  Mr Bruce  Chu, a vicepresident of the government-run Taiwan power company, that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> safeguards can be avoided because, to use his words, ‘There will always be a free market in <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one of the basic reasons that the Government has entered into the production, mining and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is that it gives the Government a voice in regard to safeguards which it would not otherwise have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A spokesman for the Australian Conservation Foundation claims that because of a severe downturn in nuclear programs throughout the world and as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has moved from a sellers market to a buyers market, there was concern that the Australian Government would relax its stringent security and controls and, in an effort to boost sales, would offer sites within Australia for the dumping of nuclear waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that there is to be some significant fall-off in demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuel in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general evidence is that the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuel in the world will continue to grow, and grow significantly, and Australia will have a very important role in providing that fuel under the strictest safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government has delayed issue of any formal authorities to mine until other recommendations concerning the grant of Aboriginal land and environmental protection mechanisms have been implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are well aware, the Alligator Rivers Region constitutes a source of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> of major significance by world standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government gives reasons to very few people, except the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners, why it introduces certain legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps has the Government taken, or will it take, to implement the recommendations contained in the First Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, that research and development programmes into (a) liquid fuels to replace petroleum, and (b) energy sources other than fossil and nuclear fusion are immediately and urgently required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why a few weeks ago we saw a mad rush to pass the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in the Northern Territory have been conned by this Government into believing that the mining and selling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be their salvation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Government has decided that forthwith: proposals for foreign investment in new projects will not require government approval under the foreign investment guidelines unless the project involves an investment of $5 million or more- this does not apply to investment in the financial sector and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; in the case of investments coming within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act, the Government will not normally seek to intervene if the assets of the company being taken over are less than $2m, unless there are special circumstances or the business is in the financial sector or some other area where special considerations apply; and individual real estate acquisitions of less than $250,000 will no longer require approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These modifications do not affect the policy in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects or the requirements of the Foreign Takeovers Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allegations were then made, supported by statutory declarations relating to alleged statements by  Mr Robinson  on the Government’s decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided that the terms of reference should be widened to cover the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> allegations and revised terms of reference were drafted by the law officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the issue of allegations about statements made by  Mr Robinson  on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the Commissioner reported: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 26 July 1 977 at Beaudesert in the State of Queensland, the Honourable Eric Robinson made a statement concerning the likely decisions of the Commonwealth Government in relation to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia to the following effect- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be making a decision about the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> early in the Budget session which commences in about three weeks ‘ time <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is satisfied that all interests requiring protection can be protected, I would expect the Government to authorise mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the series of talks that have taken place recently between the Northern Land Council and the Government concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> royalties, is the Minister in a position to indicate to the Senate the present situation in relation to the financial arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation was passed during the autumn sittings of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it intended to review staff ceilings and establishment levels, particularly in view ofthe anticipated development in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the construction of a new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of the anticipated development in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will be closely monitored, and any necessary variations to establishment will be made in the light of developments in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There had been further allegations made by  Mr Cameron  in relation to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 3 May 1978  (Hansard,  pages 1324-5)  Senator Wriedt  asked me, as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs, questions, without notice, concerning consultation with the States on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the honourable senator to my statement on 25 August 1977  (Hansard page  536) on the announcement of the Government’s decision on the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which makes it clear that there is no intention of Australia storing other countries’ radioactive wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, one might contrast the practicality of a referendum on whether we should export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with a referendum on whether High Court judges should retire at the age of 70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would instance as present examples: Whether or not we should mine or export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and whether or not marihuana should be decriminalised or legalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) What countries are mining and exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What countries have known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but are not yet mining it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What safeguards are being imposed by countries at present exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although no authoritative information is available on Eastern Bloc countries, it is understood that Czechoslovakia also mines and exports <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some countries have produced only small quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from their reserves, namely Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan and Sweden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those countries mining and exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Gabon and the USA are all parties to the NPT and require IAEA safeguards to be applied to their exports of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under the provisions of Article III (2) of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>South Africa has stated that it has undertaken to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to non-nuclear weapon states only under IAEA or equivalent safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rich in minerals, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP would not proceed with the proposal in the Government’s Budget for the expenditure of $20m on the development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to point out that the Leader of the Government in the Senate and other Ministers would have been aware of the section of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental report of  Mr Justice  Fox which advised that the creek systems of Goodparla and Gimbat be included in the Kakadu reserve in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In which countries did the Minister have discussions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment during his recent overseas visit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did these discussions include discussions on different methods for the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister had discussions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment with French officials and the URENCO consortium during his recent visit overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France has registered an interest in co-operating with us in the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Young  said, URENCO, which is a tripartite consortium of the United Kingdom, West German and Netherlands governments, has previously registered an interest in co-operating in establishing a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> enrichment offers real possibilities of substantially increasing export earnings and employment from the development of Australia’s vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this attitude the Government is anxious to collaborate with other countries in examining the feasibility of establishing a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not surprisingly, State governments are interested in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland are all interested in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment, and the URENCO team has had discussions with the governments of those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Premier has had some difficulty in reconciling his attitudes on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to speak particularly about the agreement for the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gist of” the matter with which I have been concerned for a long period and about which we must think very seriously is the supplying of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to countries with totalitarian governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised that question with the then Minister in the light of a statement made by  Mr Anthony,  the Minister for Trade and Resources, on 17 November last year in which he said that he believed Australia should supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines and that the Philippines wanted 3000 tonnes from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s views on the countries to which it is prepared to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are quite well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in the course of my statement I shall say nothing at length about the agreement for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Finland, for very obvious reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say that I cannot make the same sort of comment about the Government of the Philippines, nor could I make the same sort of comment about the Government of Iran which is also a country shopping in the market for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great deal of concern by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and by the Foreign Operations Sub-Committee of the House Appropriations Committee relating to the development of the nuclear reactor in the Philippines which Australia is now to supply with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember the glossy white folder we received last year called ‘Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy’, or something like that, which was distributed to members of parliament, school children and Godknowswho else in Australia to explain to them that the Government was very concerned about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to overseas countries and that it would insist on the highest possible standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although one assumes that the agreements with Finland and the Philippines are the same, there are very important distinctions which have to be made between the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to these two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am sure honourable senators will recall vividly the pious statements that were made about our intentions as to where <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was to be sold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether that level of concern has been shown also because it was quite clear as early as November last year that  Mr Anthony  intended to proceed with the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be said that it is none of our business what they do in the Philippines but the point is that this Government again and again has said that we will sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> only if we are totally satisfied with the standards that will apply in the recipient countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the answer is no, that we cannot be satisfied but we still intend to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the answer, I would like to hear it said; otherwise it is ridiculous carrying on with debate on the so-called guidelines for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports which suggest that we are bestowing some form of beneficience upon the rest of the world by providing it not only with our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also with our extremely high public standards as a bonus to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may not seem very relevant to this debate but it is by way of contrast to the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to a country such as Finland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only if the agreements have taken cognisance of those points can the much vaunted and lauded policy of the Government which we were given last year of ensuring that Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be sold only to countries where adequate and proper safeguards were provided, be put beyond the concern of members of this Parliament, and the policy upon which the Government has embarked in fact be seen to be living up to the rhetoric which accompanied its announcement last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the extensive debates on the various pieces of legislation associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> many questions were left unanswered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I have risen to speak tonight is that there has been some sort of extreme speculation in the newspapers in relation to whether certain land tenure problems associated with Ranger would mean that the operations of one of the other two <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects would precede it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned about  that matter because I know that just recently in the  Australian Financial Review  there was an article headed: ‘<span class="highlight">Uranium</span>- despite hurdles the search goes on’ by John  Burne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That invites us to understand that other decisions could be made by the Government that would create other beach heads for the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said that we will try to control <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction whereas the United States legislation to which I am referring, which is a Bill that was introduced into the United States Congress by Representatives Udall and Seibellin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that what I am trying to get at is that, if there is an attempt to beat the gun to start the operations of one of the other proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, excluding Ranger, because of litigation flowing from the considerations of the Aboriginal land rights committee, decisions may be made which get away from the recommendations of the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and concerns recent statements in the media which allege that the Commonwealth Government in its dealings with foreign buyers of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is not adhering to the nuclear safeguards which the Prime Minister announced on 24 May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minerals abound: a near monopoly of titanium ore; one quarter of the noncommunist bloc’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; plentiful supplies of coa), iron, copper, bauxite, silver, lead and zinc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That represents an immediate market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide of 1,000 tonnes a year with a value of $87m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Taiwan is buying materials from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Japan, Canada and the United States and is even getting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A note of warning was given by President Carter of the United States of America when he said that we should be providing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to those countries in order to fulfil their energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Orders were made under that Act prohibiting Australian based evidence from being used for the purpose of United States legal proceedings concerning marketing arrangements for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it a fact that the Northern Land Council was forced to sign an agreement for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many members of the Northern Land Council were present when the decision was taken by the Council to sign the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister advise officials of the Northern Land Council that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would go ahead even if the agreement was not signed by the Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that this article points out that, by using microbes to leach waste, metals can be recovered and the environment protected at hardly any cost, and that the technique can be used on most metals including, very importantly, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, copper, zinc and nickel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1960s, copper was biologically leached from waste rock at Rum Jungle and in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area there the recovery was worth in the vicinity of $100,000 a year; so the process was a proposition in earlier times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is based on submissions I made during the adjournment debate a fortnight ago when I sought information on the acreage of the proposed Kakadu National Park as set out in the second report of  Mr Justice  Fox’s Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry as compared with the Alaskan parklands provided for in legislation of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are saying is that unless we look in a global sense at satellites, at Concorde, at <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, at whatever new inventions the technologists give us, we will have perpetrated the greatest crime on our children by leaving this an unhappy place, a less safe place, for them- or perhaps leave no place at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Two days ago I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Carrick,  to ascertain the facts regarding a discussion in Darwin about the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Roxby Downs, in the northern part of South Australia, is said to have a huge copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem that the South Australian Government has in facing up to the development of such a project as this is that the copper ore is intertwined with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government, for ideological reasons, is not prepared to consider developing such a project because it would involve mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Minister for Mines and Energy in South Australia,  Mr Hugh  Hudson, is on record as having said that he would like to see the project go ahead but that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore would have to be stockpiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That is the very reason why miners would need to sell the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as well as the copper ore. That is the whole point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the South Australian Government will not consider the development of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia, although it talked about it in the days of the late  Mr Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can win the next election, which I seriously doubt at this stage because of the lack of popularity of the Dunstan Government, it is quite possible that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment development will get off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the controversy that is occurring in the Northern Territory at the moment over the Northern Land Council and the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been pressure from the Friends of the Earth, conservationists, anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> groups, the Australian Labor Party, the Northern Territory Government, the Federal Government- from all quarters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to canvass the rights or the wrongs of the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but should he be someone more pliable to those who want to prevent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory and those who want to destroy the credibility of Aboriginal people by saying that we cannot negotiate with the Aboriginal people because they do not understand and therefore we have to take over control and show them what is good for them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were most struck by the fact that although there were questions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and several other quite controversial questions, the highest response for a Yes vote was to the question whether it was thought that political parties should disclose all sources of their funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that, under existing United States- Japanese nuclear power agreements, Washington ‘s approval is necessary for transport overseas of spent fuel from American <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give a guarantee that the Australian Government will demand that the Japanese Government not permit any such action in respect of any Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> shipments which may go to Japan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to reprocessing of irradiated fuel containing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> received from the United States, such reprocessing may be performed in Japanese facilities upon a joint determination of the parties that the safeguards provisions may be effectively applied, or in such other facilities as may be mutually agreed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia, the Prime Minister in his statement in the House on 24 May 1977 said that provision would be made in bilateral agreements with countries wishing to import Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to ensure that any nuclear material we export for peaceful purposes under new contracts can only be reprocessed if Australia is fully satisfied as to the arrangements and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerned the problems occurring in the Northern Territory as regards the Northern Land Council and the agreement that was to be signed by the Council and the Government to allow the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is obsessed with this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will go to any length to try to stop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining being developed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite will stir up the trade union movement, the academics and anybody else to try to frustrate the Government’s desire to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the interest of this nation and in the interests of people in other parts of the world who are working to proceed with the nuclear age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The methods used by the Government to impose its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy on to Aboriginal communities of the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the substance of what the Government wants to do: To allow the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to go ahead, regardless of the consequences to the Aboriginal people, regardless of the consequences to Australia and totally regardless of the consequences to the countries to which we sell our yellowcake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> royalties would make no difference to the services which the Commonwealth would continue to see were available to NT Aboriginals, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Ian  Viner, said today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An explanatory note states that  Dr Camilleri  is convenor of the Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even disregarding the fact that it will be a number of years before substantial amounts of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> royalties are available, it will also be a long time before the handicaps which Aboriginals suffer in health, education and other areas will be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In time to come, the money flowing to Aboriginals as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> royalties will lessen the need for special programs of assistance but it will not be for a long time yet . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same approach is now being adopted towards a different area, namely, towards the Northern Land Council and everybody in this country who is opposed to mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could be the greatest leader in this country, but he will not be because he is going to be destroyed by  Mr Fraser  and everybody associated with him in their mad bid to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the multinational companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was referring again to Galarrwuy- be someone more pliable to those who want to prevent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory and those who want to destroy the credibility of Aboriginal people by saying that we cannot negotiate with the Aboriginal people because we do not understand and therefore we have to take over control and show them what is good for them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to quote a few paragraphs from each of those two letters to emphasise my point that there are groups of people in this country who are just as concerned as all the Aborigines in .the Northern Territory and who do not want to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining or, if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is going to proceed because of the pressures applied, they want it to be done on their terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  also asked how many members of the Northern Land Council were present when the decision was taken by the Council to sign the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though actual mining will not commence for some time, the development of the support, communication and service facilities in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province will result in a significant injection of capital resources in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources aware that Mount Isa Mines Ltd, in association with other companies, has discovered <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits at Olary in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that Mount Isa Mines, in conjunction with the Australian mineral development organisation in South Australia has conducted extensive research into the in situ <span class="highlight">uranium</span> leaching technique which is environmentally appealing and which could be used at Olary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not any information in respect of the specific discovery of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit referred to by  Senator Jessop  in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is very interesting and indeed very satisfactory that there should be such further discovery of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, of course, other potential <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the other States, particularly in my own State of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government announced its policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development on 25 August last year, it said that subject to satisfactory completion of necessary environmental requirements, decisions would be taken on the development of projects in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wish to emphasise that subject to the broad requirements which have been applied in relation to the Ranger mine, the same opportunity for development, as far as the Federal Government is concerned, will be accorded to deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> found in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it seems that the major impediment to the development of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in South Australia would be the policy of the South Australian Government, and particularly the Premier of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Premier seems to have set his face against the development of such projects and seems to want to deny the people of his State the benefits and employment opportunities which would flow from the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we are gravely concerned over the extreme weakness shown by our Prime Minister and his Government in his  handling of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining situation in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by reminding the Minister of a statement that I made in this place on 26 September 1978 regarding pressure being applied to members of the Northern Land Council by the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in order to get <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the announcement of Australia’s decision to proceed with further development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a model bi-lateral safeguards agreement was prepared on the basis of the stringent safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, an integral part of Australia’s safeguards policy that all exports of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under future contracts will have to be covered by safeguards agreements between the Australian Government and importing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to the difficulties being experienced in the negotiations between Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd and the Northern Land Council which are causing further delays to Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines, Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Queensland Mines Ltd. As the delays will make it difficult for Australia to meet its existing contracts for the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to overseas countries, will the Minister consider giving early approval for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Yeelirrie and other Western Australian deposits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is very hopeful that the current consideration being given by the Northern Land Council to the initial Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd agreement will enable the agreement to be executed with minimum delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This applies to any other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence tell the Senate of all the locations in South Australia where <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by-products and other radioactive materials have been buried? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia we are now confronted with a second wave of development which will see the development of energy-oriented programs, such as the North West Shelf gas project and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining project at Yeelirrie and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few would disagree that the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, export and its possible enrichment has caused anxiety and some division within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many reasons for this state of affairs and perhaps one is that the Labor Opposition at its 1 977 Perth Federal Conference decided upon a policy calling for a two-year moratorium on further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development- this, after having taken an enthusiastic development approach whilst in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant outcomes of the initial mood of enthusiasm was the decision by the Whitlam Government to make itself a partner in the development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> site by signing the memorandum of understanding in October 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is the Minister able to indicate to the Senate the Government’s position in relation to the next step in this situation in order to resolve the problems which now arise in introducing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about Aborigines or land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask also whether the delays in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory that have been caused by the indecision of the Northern Land Council will encourage further research into and development of fast breeder reactors throughout the world and encourage other countries to turn to other suppliers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which in turn could mean, if the trend continued, that Aboriginals in the Northern Territory would miss out completely on royalties and monetary benefits from the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, Opposition senators are very sensitive to their activities, and the repercussions of their activities, in relation to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter that  Senator Young  raisedagain it is a matter of fact- is in relation to delays that may occur and the consequences of such delays in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: In the light of the media report today that members of the NLC at Oenpelli have decided not to sign the Ranger agreement, not on the grounds as stated before of not wishing to disturb Aboriginal ground or of possible dangers in mining but that more money is demanded, will the Government take note of the petitions I have lodged this week in the Senate signed by over 5,000 people mainly from the Darwin area which call for the Government to take a realistic attitude to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the development of the North? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My ministerial colleagues today have amplified that this discussion, as reported from Oenpelli, has not concerned the environmental aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all but the financial circumstances of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Minister refuse, on 13 October 1977, to make public the reports that had been compiled as part of his Department ‘s efforts to monitor the debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; if so, why? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Minister, in response to a request by  Mr J.  McMillan, Lecturer in Law at the University of New South Wales, declined to make the reports referred to in the Question public because they were considered confidential at that stage of the Government’s consideration of the action it should take in response to the findings and recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environment Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>AN ATTEMPT AT AN OVERVIEW OF THE <span class="highlight">URANIUM</span> DEBATE <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this time there has been widespread discussion of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue in the media, particularly over the last month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Developers believe that the report signals the go-ahead, however there has been disagreement with the recommendation for sequential development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, the Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining has stated that the report does not give the ‘green light’ and that if the requirements of the report are implemented in full this would amount to an effective moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent gallup poll conducted since the release of the second report has indicated that a slight majority (51 per cent) are in favour of the sale of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure has increased by only 1 per cent over the past year compared with an increase of 8 per cent in the number of people (37 per cent) wanting to discourage <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of this change is interesting to note in view of the $600,000 media campaign conducted by the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers ‘ Forum over the past few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scientific community is still divided on the issue with eminent scientists expressing both support of and opposition to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they have been supported by other scientists and technicians, notably 300 who signed a written declaration prepared by the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers’ Forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large number of scientists have opposed the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and have also signed a declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A statement supporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and prepared by the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Producers’ Forum has been signed by a group of doctors (representing 2 per cent of the Australian medical community). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Church groups have continued to voice their opposition and have been pressing for a moratorium on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservation groups and the umbrella organization- Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining (MAUM)- a growing national coalition of trade unions, environmental, women’s, church, peace and other community groups have continued to urge for a 5-year moratorium, claiming that this is in concurrence with the recommendations of the second Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party at its recent National Conference has decided in favour of an indefinite moratorium on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and treatment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the unions who have voiced their opinion on the issue have voted against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and have called for moratoriums of varying lengths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However some, and in particular, the Australian Workers’ Union believe that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be mined, provided adequate safeguards are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, it seems as if those who are taking a stand on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue are aware of the purported problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a moratorium took place and the doubts about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining were dispelled during that time it is possible that the community may become less divided in its attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to talk about the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am motivated to raise this question tonight because of recent statements by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and in particular by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  that, regardless of the Aborigines’ wishes, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the last resorts in a political battle being fought by this Government to ensure that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is carried out at any cost, including the cost of the lives, health and everything else of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by reminding the Minister of a statement that I made in this place on 26 September 1978 regarding pressure being applied to members of the Northern Land Council by the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in order to get <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it is a matter of using another black man for the sake of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; nothing else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at the moment in the Northern Territory a  Mr Randell  who has changed his whole lifestyle in order to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we come to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which is a finite energy resource anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an unhealthy immoral attitude on the part of this Government in trying to get the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can ask who made tours overseas quite recently in an endeavour not only to sell the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also to provide the background so that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be sold and mined with a minimum of inconvenience to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can look back into history and remember that only a few weeks prior to 1 1 October 1975 a certain international organisation was able to make a public statement that there would be a change of Government in Australia and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about Aborigines or land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the real position with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger company was set up as a partnership with the Australian Government to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Jabiru. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Australian Government has confirmed that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will go ahead after Aboriginal interests were properly cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of those Australians who are against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia belong to or give support to antiuranium groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some because they believe that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is going to hurt people and land, some because they want to attack the present Liberal Government and some because they want to attack the whole basis of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government sends him there to pimp on its behalf and to talk to the Land Council to drive its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has used that black man’s signature so it can sell out this country to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only a little over two weeks ago that the Government’s efforts to rush a start to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining foundered because of the courageous action of several Aboriginal communities whose members resisted the Government’s bullying and demanded an opportunity to examine and discuss the Ranger agreement in their own language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is where the seepage will come out, with contamination of the water because of the residue of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Everingham said he was certain the divisions within the Northern Land Council over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining had been orchestrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas I am more than happy to substantiate your statement that I am ‘vigorously opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining’ the inference that I was at Goulburn Island on Monday 9 October an hour before the arrival of  Mr Galarrwuy  Yunupingu and was involved with the distribution of banners and subsequent demonstration against the Northern Land Council  Chairman  is a blatant untruth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real pressure is coming from the other side of the chamber, under pressure from the international mining combines which want to get the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground regardless of the cost to the Aboriginal people, to the people in the countries in which it will be used and to Australians generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say now that if there is not an open and public inquiry this country is well on the way to a dictatorship and you,  Mr President,  and honourable senators on that side of the chamber will not know where  Mr Fraser  is leading you because he will use every possible thing to knuckle under to the great financial interests of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s attempt to blame members of the Australian Labor Party for Aboriginal opposition to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the Government’s allegation that all the lawyers involved are members of the Australian Labor Party, I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that the lawyer representing the Northern Land Council,  Mr E.  Pratt, who is reported in the  National Times  this week as being responsible for the so-called simple English version of the draft Ranger Agreement is, or until recently was, a member of the Australian Liberal Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sends him there to pimp on its behalf and to talk to the Land Council to drive its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Northern Land Council tapes of the Aboriginal Red Lilly meeting relating to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> agreement were used by  Mr Bob  Collins, MLA, on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program  AM  to discredit the results of the meeting of Aboriginals which was to honour the agreement by the NLC negotiators and the Federal Government, will the Government request that the tapes taken by the two Australian Labor Party solicitors, James and Waters, advisers to the dissident faction at a later meeting at Oenpelli last week, be released for public scrutiny? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted reports of the continuing exploration success of the Western Mining Corporation Ltd at Roxby Downs in South Australia demonstrating the extensive potential value of the copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits located there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the South Australian Government indicated its attitude to mining such deposits even though the South Australian Premier has publicly stated his attitude to be against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of the attitude of the South Australian Government, and in particular the Premier, in regard to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Social Security heard of a place near the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area known as ‘Camp Concern’ where a number of people have been camped for a considerable time as a protest against <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard of Camp Concern’ where I understand that up to five or six people at any one time are camped on a property adjoining the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are current public concerns about all aspects of science, whether it be socio-biology, the misuse of psychology, recombinant DNA experiments, or the latest technology in the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see this in matters such as the debates on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy or tariff policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As evidence of that claim I have just made I refer to the recent statement made by  Mr Anthony  regarding the ABC and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24 September  Mr Anthony  complained that the ABC had held up the commencement of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining by broadcasting anti-mining views or the antimining side of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem from  Mr Anthony’s  comments that the ABC had a responsibility to present only the Government’s view with regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government investigate the truth of the assertion made by a  Mr Bruce  Chu, a Vice-President of the Government-run Taiwan Power Company, that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> safeguards can be avoided because, to use his words, ‘There will always be a free market in <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understood that  Mr Chu  was responding to a remark that in view of Australia’s safeguards policy, Australia could not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this is a prior condition for the export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, Taiwan is not an eligible customer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite recently I spoke on the motion for the first reading of another money Bill, when I devoted my remarks largely to the problems associated with the decision by the Government to go ahead at all costs with the mining of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see a repudiation of that policy in relation to the Aborigines in the current struggle which is going on with the transnational mining companies who are trying to get out of the ground the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The granting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining leases at Boghole Creek is the subject of another question on notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 10 October I asked what had happened to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore dump at Snake Creek in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leases at Boghole Creek have been surrounded by secrecy ever since that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following discussions between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Northern Land Council and the traditional land owners at Bamyili and Oenpelli in the Northern Territory last week, documents have been signed which give the green light for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Mr Tom  Uren, M.P., shadow minister for urban and regional affairs, has indicated that the Australian Labor Party will not honour <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts made by the Australian Government and overseas clients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that there is deadly <span class="highlight">uranium</span> dust mixed with topsoil at Maralinga in South Australia and whether this is being blown to other populated areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that there is no such <span class="highlight">uranium</span> dust in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considerable publicity has been given to the signing of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining agreement and the ramifications thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House gave due warning to those who want to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly on the prima facie evidence that is available to us at the moment, there would be reason for us to suggest to the Government that there is considerable doubt whether the intention of the Act, the intention of the environmental impact statement and the intention of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry have been properly put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that there would not be very many honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber- certainly not many honourable senators on my side of the chamber- who would not assert that the Aborigines will be affected by the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, particularly in the Ranger area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a government that is preoccupied with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly will refer the information that was contained in the question to the Minister for National Development whom I represent here because I am sure that he will be as interested in the material that is supplied in that report as I am and as I am sure honourable senators on this side are interested, even though the Opposition seems to be determined to fly in the face of all facts in relation to the question of nuclear power and the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that the United Kingdom Labour Government takes an attitude to this question very different from that taken by the Labor Party when in Opposition in Australia, although, as I pointed out in answer to a question yesterday, the Australian Labor Party took a rather different attitude to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the statement made by  Mr Uren,  the Labor shadow minister for urban and regional affairs suggesting that the Labor Party would terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> agreements with overseas clients if it became the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would such action, firstly, remove the opportunity for Aboriginal employment in the mining operations and associated industries; secondly, cancel the very considerable financial benefits agreed to be paid on establishment of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; and thirdly, cancel out the royalty payments to which the Aboriginal people would become entitled and thus prevent them from assisting all other Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to improve their living standards and way of life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff has raised three questions with regard to Aborigines and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is understood by everybody that if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining did not take place in the areas concerned there would certainly be fewer opportunities for Aboriginal employment than otherwise would be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters were part of the agreement and it is understood that the financial benefits to Aboriginal communities which would enable them to progress further in the direction of self management would result from the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware whether he made specific reference to these things, but I make the general comment that if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining did not proceed the financial benefits and the employment opportunities would certainly be minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a question about employment prospects for Aborigines in the event of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining proceeding in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is understood by everybody that if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining did not take place in the areas concerned - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek a specific ministerial response concerning a matter which arises out of the estimates of the Department of Trade and Resources and which relates to the appointment of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now something like eight months since  Mr Anthony  announced that he expected in the near future to invite individuals to be members of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council, yet no announcement of any kind in this respect has been made by the Minister to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This cannot but lead one to suspect that the Government just does not want any independent scrutiny of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy and decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One notices in particular in this respect that the Ranger agreement itself and the nuclear safeguards agreements which have now been entered into with the Philippines and Finland have all been finalised without the advice of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council or the scrutiny by that Council of the proposed terms of the agreements in question- this, despite the various problems that have emerged and the many criticisms that have been made in relation to the method of reaching these respective agreements, and their content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I ask the Minister specifically: When can we expect the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council to be appointed, set on foot, and established on an on-going, proper basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: In view of this conclusion, and the serious admissions by this responsible body, what steps will the Government take to curtail the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for commercial purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, will the Government, until adequate safeguards are provided, review its unilateral decision to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The safeguards that the Commonwealth Government is applying to the use of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> products throughout the world are the most stringent of any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that this Government has the advice of world-recognised experts in the field of radioactivity and has received an assurance that it can indeed proceed with the mining, milling, marketing and exportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for subsequent processing through power generating plants, without this posing a threat of a significant kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unhappily for South Australia it has in it some <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because of the backward attitude of the Australian Labor Party which, at the Perth conference, said Keep <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground’, while everyone else in the world is selling it and capitalising on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant which would naturally follow- if we could regain lost ground- would provide far more jobs in the long term then would even the Redcliff petrochemical project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will take place but <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is by no means the only mineral that exists in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view ofthe fact that there is a considerable amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Australia and that industry– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question raises some very important points about the future of South Australia, particularly in relation to mineral development and the siting of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already expressed views in the Senate about the importance that is attached to the mineral discovery at Roxby Downs and the prospects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact, unfortunately, that the Premier of that State does not seem to be giving encouragement to the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will refer to the Minister for National Development that part of the question which raises particular points about the progress that is being made in discussions about the siting of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant and other detailed matters concerning the development of the Roxby Downs mineral deposit and endeavour to get a detailed and early answer from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not be fooled by some of the comments that are being made about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being the panacea that will provide all the jobs needed in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its policy to develop the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding of October 1975 which provided for mining to be undertaken under the Atomic Energy Act by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard honourable senators will recall that in June this year the Atomic Energy Act was amended to authorise the participation of the Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One provision of the Memorandum requires that the initial authority for mining should be issued for 2 1 years, others provide that the Ranger project will be conducted as a commercial venture and continue in force during the economic life of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, the Bill deals with section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act, the section under which an authority to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is granted by the Minister for Trade and Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite bluntly, the Bill is an attempt to legislate against the possibility of a future Labor government revoking an authority to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision to mine and sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should not be made unless the Commonwealth government ensures that the Commonwealth can at any time on the basis of considerations of the nature discussed in this report, immediately terminate those activities, permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977 the Minister for Trade and Resources announced the Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and in his statement on this very question stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will therefore always be in a position to move immediately to terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period as recommended by the Ranger inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second important consequence of this Bill is that new conditions and restrictions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, particularly those recommended in the Ranger report, could not be arbitrarily or unilaterally added to the authority to mine which is given by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing, in the case of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, with perhaps not a very dangerous process; but in dealing with the development of the nuclear industry generally we are dealing with a dangerous process which is a cause of concern to nations and communities throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, the memorandum of understanding referred to an initial authority to be granted for a period of 2 1 years and added that the Ranger project was not to continue in force during the economic life of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the project area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is for about 85,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be mined; at 3,000 tonnes per annum rising to 6,000 tonnes per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me point to the main, basic objections of the Opposition: Firstly, there is the basic objection that the Labor Opposition has a different policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from that of the Government Of course, that is a legitimate objection of which account has to be taken in the normal process of political debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third main objection is that .governments should at all times have the authority to order the cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, based on considerations of nuclear proliferation, including the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty which we have signed and some of the countries to which we have arranged to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have signed but are clearly not abiding by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments should have the authority at all times to order the cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> rnining because of important issues such as waste disposal and environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one asks questions in this place about the steps which are being taken by miners in the Northern Territory in relation to that issue, one just does not get answers on important questions such as the pollution of the Alligator River, All these questions should be a fundamental principle that governments and this Parliament have the right to order the cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining because of some of those very important considerations which are involved in this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole case in favour of controlling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploitation is that it needs and ought to be treated differently from other mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of the first Ranger Inquiry report, ‘<span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a very special metal’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a very special metal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look back to the headlines in newspapers prior to the 1977 election where people like  Mr Anthonythe  professional loud mouths of Australian politics- were promising that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would produce 100,000 jobs, we recall that sort of stuff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was on the basis of projections like this that the much heralded <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining decision was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to the day when they can tell me that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia has provided 100,000 jobs or anything like that number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on the basis of those sorts of things that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has become a very special metal for this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One appreciates that, whilst  Senator Button  dealt in detail with some particular objections to the amendments, the overall policy of the Opposition at this stage is one of total opposition to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button had quite a bit to say about the environmental aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should remind the Opposition that a package of Bills dealing with the proposed mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory was introduced early this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the safeguards that were put down by the Government with regard to the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> overseas are the strictest safeguards of any country which exports <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was drawn up between the Whitlam Government and these two companies for the purpose of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Project shall continue in force during the economic life of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Project area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to give security of tenure so that agreement will be reached between the Northern Land Council and the consortium with regard to the further mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> beyond 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One appreciates, of course, that the Whitlam Labor Government was very keen to establish <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that will be mined- I refer to the Ranger project and to the Yeelirrie deposits in Western Australia, which the Western Australian Government is to get under way- and the need for safeguards we can understand the need for enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to take place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia has led the way in research into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Dunstan Government- I give it full marks in this respect; I am not criticising it- has backed an expert <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment committee that has been working on research in this area for some six years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia is regarded as the State with the greatest expertise in the field of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we know that Western Australia, through its Premier,  Sir Charles  Court, is doing everything possible to get the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under way and would also like to see an enrichment plant established in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is also held by the Labor Party but at this stage it is not coming out in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, although it has done excellent work in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment and I give it full marks for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know also that in South Australia there are great deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly South Australia, if it were soon to begin getting into production in the actual mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could still lead the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another reason why I hope that the State Government will change its mind is that at Roxby Downs, about which quite a deal has been said in the last few months, there are vast copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is that is also has <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inasmuch as  Senator Button  made reference to the policy of his party and ours, I have been dealing with that of the Australian Labor Party federally on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also trying to prove that with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Ranger there will eventually be a need to meet safeguards and guidelines, to establish an enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it is far easier to comply with safeguards than if one merely exports U308, or yellowcake, as it is commonly known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia has a favourable geographical situation and vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this vast amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as well as that in the Northern Territory, there will be need for an enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that happened, many members of the Australian Labor Party who sit on the other side of the chamber could at last stand up and speak openly, as they would like to do, in supporting the mining and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as they did when their party was in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world is hungry for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and it is up to us to make sure that we supply the means of producing some of that greatly-needed energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the introduction of these amendments to the Atomic Energy Act amounts to an admission by the Government of how inappropriate this Act is as the legislative framework for the development and exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That disenchantment with the Minister in another place is understandable because, as I say, the Atomic Energy Act is quite inappropriate as as vehicle for the exploitation of mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for peaceful purposes and for commercial profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 of the First Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, known colloquially as the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend against the use of that Act for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say, and I think it needs to be freely admitted, that the Labor Government decided that this Act was suitable as an initial legislative base for the Ranger venture; but that same Government then set up the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and, I believe, undoubtedly would have acted on the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry to abandon this Act- a recommendation which was based on most cogent considerations which I will outline to the Senate shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when one looks at the second reading speech of the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  in another place, it becomes quite obvious that for the Ranger project to be brought into a workable situation whereby <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be mined, it is most necessary for the proposed amendments to be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the provisions of the old atomic energy legislation, which I think was introduced in 1945, relating to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it is obvious that that legislation is quite outmoded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year or two there has been a lot of emotion, some hysteria and a tremendous amount of activity leading up to the point where we can now see the commencement of the mining of this <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think many people have really forgotten that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory is not something new but really commenced many years ago, in the late 1940s or early 1950s, at Moline east of Katherine and at Batchelor, Rum Jungle, where the Australian Atomic Energy Commission developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> was developed there quietly for many years and that source of supply was used for very many purposes, including meeting Australia’s obligations overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>October 1975 saw the memorandum of understanding of the Labor Government brought into being and which, if I remember rightly, was signed by  Mr Whitlam, Mr Connor, Dr Cairns  and perhaps one other person on behalf of the Government and by the people of Peko-Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd to bring about the commencement of further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appeared in those days that the development and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were going to be another phase in Australia’s development but, of course, this situation did not come about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the people who have been against the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, particularly those people in the Northern Territory, who endeavoured during the negotiations with the Aboriginal people to prevent them from coming to an agreement, used every method under the sun to prevent the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Agreement from being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These publications were printed in a comic-type format and, when tied to their culture and their laws, were an attempt to bring about tremendous fears in the minds of the Aboriginal people as to what would happen to them if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another one depicted an Aboriginal woman carrying a child and showed that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was killing the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness to this person, could he not be left alone with his Aboriginal people to work out their future in Arnhem Land and in what we call the Kakudu National Park, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province, or whatever one wishes to call it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are considering the future of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining we must remember that, particularly in the last two years, the people of the Northern Territory- in fact, people throughout Australia- have become more and more interested in the development and surveillance of northern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people may not believe it but this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will bring about tremendous developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will see the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will bring about great advances in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may ask why <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will have an effect on surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reinforce my point by saying that this was indicated by a secret written ballot conducted of 6,000 Australian Democrat members last year to determine our policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than 70 per cent of those people voted for a policy option stating that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should not be exported from Australia until three vital criteria could be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters relate directly to the very basis of consideration of this Bill which I see as being the flexibility in decision-making in the future in the whole area of nuclear power and the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> so that the decisions may quickly and readily be taken in accordance with the wishes of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there again is reason for absolute flexibility for future governments to deal with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in a way which suits the circumstances of the time, without limitation, without any kind of hindrance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any attempt to perpetuate the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry through legislative means be justified in circumstances in which there has been an actual decline in nuclear power production and when there is recognition, as there is in the State of California, that it is necessary for societies to live without nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears in all good faith to wish to perpetuate in a solidified way into the future- 21 years or more- the right of private corporations to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to wherever they wish within reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not seem to realise that this is cloud cuckoo land where nuclear energy is concerned; there is no El Dorado for Australia in nuclear energy and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite, such as  Senator Young,  should participate in this debate instead of making accusations that some members of the Australian Labor Party want to support the rnining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that he does not puts the lie once and for all to the story that more than half of the Australian Labor Party members in reality wants to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Labor Party outside this chamber do not want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined and used any more than do 50 per cent of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite  Senator Young  to give honourable senators the names of those members of the Australian Labor Party who, he says, support <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage the Australian Labor Party did support the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but it was not then aware of the dangers and the difficulties attached to the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not one scientist in the world who, with the support of his colleagues, would tell us that there is a safe way to handle the waste from the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was a scientist who had a foolproof method, he and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners would have told the world about it because they would have by-passed all the difficulties and problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference between the Government and the Labor Party is that the Opposition is not run by the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners, most of whom have overseas allegiances, whereas it appears that the Government is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commissioner Fox said in his report that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a very special metal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say only that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners must be very special miners because they get very special treatment from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government refuses to abide by Commissioner Fox’s recommendation that it should not use this Act if it intends going ahead with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is just setting up machinery to cover the environment as it now is; but when mining gets under way, if it does, and the information starts to flow in, if it starts to flow in, the Government will not be able to alter the circumstances under which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be mined because the Government will be tied by the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that Commissioner Fox said specifically that there should be no irrevocable undertaking to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because we know too Utile about the problems and difficulties that would be encountered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government is tying the people of this country to an agreement that cannot be broken- an agreement relating to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for a falling market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No extraordinary developments will take place in the Northern Territory because of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining; no massive number of jobs will come out of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, because the market is falling, and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners know that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that we wonder what sort of hold the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners have over this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, in this argument we must remember that we have not the only source of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More and more reports are coming in of more and more findings of deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fox said in his report that it had to be acknowledged that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could lead to nuclear war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country has initialled an agreement to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to South Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that, when the American Government said that it was going to take its troops home from South Korea, the South Korean Government said: ‘Now we are very interested in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia because we will need it to protect ourselves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just lately, at the same time as this Government was announcing that it had initialled an agreement to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to South Korea, the South Korean Press came out and pointed out that South Korea had the equipment, it had the warheads and it had the equipment to transport the warheads; and that all it needed was the nuclear warheads and it was then in the race with other larger and stronger powers in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we dig <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground, if we sell it to people and if we make any sort of profit out of a material that can affect lives for generations to come, then we have to take some responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that the responsibility we should take is to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground until such time as the world is assured that the material can be handled safely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much effort is being put into feather bedding the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners, while the majority of the Australian people who cannot be called, in  Senator Kilgariff  ‘s words, ‘left wing activists or extremists’ do not want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners must remember that, when we become the Government shortly, we will prevent the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians made the point that one way to prevent that use was to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground so that the weapons and the plutonium would not be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian delegation said: One must acknowledge the integrity of the Australian people, who up to this point have not exported their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because they are concerned about the result of that export’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that even if the Philippines Government does not seem to be concerned about that we go on merrily supplying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to a country which is prepared to construct reactors under those conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that opinions all over the world are changing in respect of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- The Opposition, supported by the Australian Democrats, has used this Bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act as a vehicle to debate and to oppose the Government’s policy to permit the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been found that the existing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act which provide for an authority to mine under that Act, and which were drawn in completely different circumstances many years ago, are not appropriate to deal with authorities to be given for the commercial operation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that this Act should not be used; that it is not the proper vehicle to give authority for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact of the matter is that the Government inherited from its predecessor, the Labor Government, a memorandum of understanding between the Government and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies under which a joint venture operation was to be carried on under the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some of the views of Opposition speakers are correct, apparently the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be a great commercial risk, so obviously there must be security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend at this stage to discuss the pros and cons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures are simply ancillary to that and are such as to ensure that the conditions upon which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has been approved by the Government and the Parliament will be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This related to a proclamation by the GovernorGeneral that it was in the national interest to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only several years ago the Opposition suggested for instance- I say this in the context of genuine discussion- that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country should be mined and exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, it is the Government’s aim to ensure that pollution of the environment due to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is reduced to a practical minimum, and we are confident that this can be achieved through the arrangements which both the Commonwealth and the Territory Governments have made for the control of mining in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those proceedings related to arrangements alleged to have been made in 1972 for the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceedings included a grand jury inquiry and civil proceedings by the Westinghouse Corporation claiming some $7 billion from 29 United States and foreign <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers, including four Australian companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the orders related to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing arrangements I have mentioned above, and were based on the need to protect our national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate, moreover, that the grand jury inquiry into the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing arrangements has been concluded and that no proceedings by the United States Justice Department have been instituted against any Australian company in consequence of that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The civil proceedings in which the Westinghouse Corporation was claiming treble damages from the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers are, however, still pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Supervising Scientist appointed by the Government to supervise the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory is to live in Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he take steps to see that the Supervising Scientist is located in the Northern Territory, preferably in what the Government calls the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province, in order to enable him to carry out his duties effectively? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does include the following recently announced projects: the Gladstone aluminium smelter$500m; the Alcoa alumina project- $200m; the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project- $300m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the possibility of building a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is pressing ahead with feasibility studies with other governments and organisations which have previously expressed interest in the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, as it automates more to keep its cost levels in line, there will be more dependence on energy, whether of the sort coming from oil, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, or other sources, and that will escalate geometrically in the period to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same year we were told that if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining went ahead in the Northern Territory 500,000 extra jobs would be created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It passed the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act which resulted in the saving of Fraser Island and it initiated the Fox inquiry into <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue, the Government notionally adopted the recommendations of the Fox report but it has been busily subverting those recommendations ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real test on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is yet to come but there is waning confidence in the community that the Government will insist on adherence to proper environmental standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was stuck with the issue of Fraser Island and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because of the actions of the previous Government in establishing inquiries into those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have criticised him before in this chamber in relation to such matters as the Iwasaki project and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money that would otherwise be used either in the exploitation or the exploration of the Barrier Reef area would be much better expended on searching out alternative sources of energy, and I am not talking about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The price fixing agreements were alleged to have been entered into by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Westinghouse company alone, I believe, is seeking damages of some $7 billion from the cartel of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers which it is alleged forced up the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the American market to a very large extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, and no doubt there always will be, a basic conflict of interest between say, the United States purchasers of Australian resources, whether they be alumina, zinc, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or natural gas, and the Australian business enterprise exporting the commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet now, belatedly, following the dramatic initiative by the late Rex Connor when he was the Minister for Minerals and Energy under the previous Labor Government, this Government has acknowledged price fixing in the case of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and in regard to iron ore, coal, bauxite and alumina the setting of prices below which commodity enterprises in Australia must not go in selling our mineral and energy resources abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote from a ministerial statement on our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export policy by the Rt Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will also determine terms and conditions relating to the duration of the contract, the quantity of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be sold under the contract, the method of shipment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the price payable for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the manner, including the currency, of payment and the use to which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be put by the purchaser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular the Bill is designed to counter the activities of the Westinghouse Corporation, which has entered into proceedings relating to arrangements alleged to have been made in 1 972 for the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceedings included a grand jury inquiry in that country and civil proceedings by Westinghouse, in which it claimed $US7 billion from 29 American and foreign <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers, including four Australian companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the Western Australian Government giving the go ahead for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Yeelirrie in Western Australia and the request of the Premier of Western Australia for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in that State, can the Minister say whether this latest development will have any adverse effects on the establishment of an enrichment plant in South Australia while the present South Australian Government continues with its current attitude towards the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, even though South Australia, with the backing of the South Australian Government, is the most advanced State in Australia on research and negotiations for the establishment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether this is to become a contest between a Western Australian senator and a South Australian senator about which State is the most advanced in the pursuit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, knowledge or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that the Western Australian Government has demonstrated a progressive attitude towards the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent announcement of the Premier of Western Australia concerning the development of the Yeelirrie deposits and the Western Australian Parliament’s passage of the Yeelirrie agreement between the Western Australian Government and the Western Mining Corporation exemplifies that State’s interest in and its ability to secure the development of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western Australian Government has expressed a strong interest also in studying the feasibility of undertaking <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude and achievements of the South Australian Government towards <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development have been quite to the contrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the electorate of South Australia is being denied potential benefits that could accrue to a State successful in attracting the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- I refer to places such as Roxby Downs and Beverley- and through possible participation in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government will now press ahead with feasibility studies with foreign governments and foreign organisations which have an interest in collaboration on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment, and it is hoped to involve State Governments as fully as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the linchpin for the protection of both the Aboriginal people and the environment at the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine site- that is, the declaration of the Kakadu National Park- not been used? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Science and the Environment aware that no environmental controls are being enforced at the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> site in the Northern Territory and that both pollution and erosion are virtually uncontrolled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament who, in fact, will be responsible for environmental protection during the development of mining sites and the exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In September 1978, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare published a report which stated that 40 per cent of all cancer deaths in the United States were due to exposure to occupational carcinogens such as asbestos, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, benzine, nickel oxide, chromium and petroleum factions, to mention just a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I wish to advise the Senate that the Commonwealth Government has approved the development of the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit by Queensland Mines Limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the Government, when announcing on 25 August 1977 its decision to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at Ranger, indicated that further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining projects in the Alligator Rivers region would only proceed when the Government was fully satisfied as to the acceptability of the impact of the development on the environment and the Aboriginal people, having regard for the region as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the legislative controls which we introduced in April 1978 regulating <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, in conjunction with the environmental requirements which will be imposed on the company, together with the controls negotiated and agreed between the Northern Land Council and Queensland Mines Limited, will ensure that any adverse impact on the local Aboriginal population will be minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Nabarlek deposit contains some 9,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to inform honourable senators of the position relating to the development of” some of the other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide recommenced at Mary Kathleen in Queensland in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include foreign investment approval of the proposed equity arrangements and compliance with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision on Nabarlek is a further step forward in our policy for the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see a balance between the economic development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and the effective protection of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nabarlek <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Project- Ministerial Statement, 7 March 1979. and move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the conflict of opinion that has existed in Australia over the last few years about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, particularly as it relates to Aboriginal affairs and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is typical of this Government that it should choose the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make a major energy and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> statement in this place when in fact the statement should have been presented by  Senator Durack  who represents the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this just highlights the fact that the Government has consistently placed the mining interests and profits from <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and all that that means, before the interests of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Land Council fears that while the deeds are not registered, the future of the proposed Kakadu National Park- guaranteed to Aborigines in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> agreement- is threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is before we look at some of the other more dubious aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit this Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy is wrong and that the Government is chasing a radioactive red herring which is endangering the future of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the findings of that Committee relates to the safety of the nuclear industry and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has presented a statement about the opening of a new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s dream of vast profits from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is insubstantial and unsubstantiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is assuring us that there will be a flood of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> into what is already a buyers’ market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now has approved three <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects- Ranger, Yeelirrie and Nabarlek- with a total annual production capacity of about 8,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide which could be on stream in the mid-1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year’s annual report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission stated that Australia could sell 10,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now those same experts are privately admitting that Australia will be lucky to sell 2,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the interim sales agreements will specify that no <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be delivered until safeguards are guaranteed and finalised, Australia will be in no position to enforce this requirement in such a strong buyers’ market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s total insensitivity to human welfare is demonstrated by successive decisions to flood the world market with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a time of international tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could be used in nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In statements published only three months ago the Government said that a safeguards agreement with Iran was imminent and that that country would buy from Australia 1,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By that time a Labor government will be installed in Canberra and, as already indicated through my Party’s federal conference, that government will repudiate any new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales contracts in the light of the lack of safeguards, in the light of inadequate consultations with the affected communities and in the light of the failure to implement promises to protect the environment and to establish national parks, matters which were expressed clearly in policy considerations for the 1975 and 1977 election campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s policy shows that we are a concerned party, that we are concerned about the ramifications of the Government’s policy, that we are concerned about the effects it will have on Aboriginal communities and that we are concerned about this Government’s acceptance of statements made years ago concerning the future of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry which has not been shown in practice to be no longer a feasible or economic possibility in the sense of this Government’s commitment to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining as an integral part of the economic development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement, like so many of the Government’s statements which are placed before the Senate, ignores the basic problems that beset the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, ignores the basic problems that face Aborigines in the area, ignores the commitments that we have made to protect that environment and ignores the commitments that we have made to establish the essential national parks in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances the Opposition can only reiterate its condemnation of the Government’s approach to the establishment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining project at Nabarlek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the truth about the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry on a world wide basis is available to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are astounded that apparently it is not aware of the facts and we believe that it can be demonstrated that there is no good sense in persisting with the exploitation of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at this time and that probably a great deal of harm ultimately will come from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that countries which were believed to be stable anchors, forces to whom it was said we could safely sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, have been demonstrated no longer to be so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also not possible to guarantee the use for peaceful purposes only of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide which we now propose to export from Nabarlek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government still seems to believe that there will be some vast benefit to Australia from exporting our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> although every authority, from the first Ranger report onwards, has said that this is clearly not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining industry, especially the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry, is very capital intensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government is playing a cruel joke on the Australian people when it pretends in the face of all this evidence that we will have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> bonanza. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has frequently been put to me and to the Australian Democrats that we might as well sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because if we do not other people will sell their <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the analogy between that opium and our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a precise and exact one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the fact that every one of those polls has shown that more and more people do not want <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exported, the Government will not face up to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democrats say: ‘Let the Australian people decide whether we export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and let them decide it soon’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in power generation is with us now and this usage will grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People have asked what Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be used for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Switzerland <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is used to generate power for heating and for the general well-being of the citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is too much pessimism and too much talk about turning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> into the bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After listening to the speeches in the Senate tonight, one would feel that Australia owned every bit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that is being developed in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People know that in fact the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in Australia represent only 22 to 25 per cent of world reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the Government’s statement tonight announcing that it has approved the development of the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There they would learn that the Aboriginals who own the land have participated in negotiations about the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of what people may say or think, the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the North is going to be tremendous for the development of the North. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who live in other parts of Australia can be well pleased that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will bring about the development of the North. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is a means of developing the North. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened with manganese will happen with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the same will happen with the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly, there was not one casualty in the 25 years that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today we hear the knockers who say that we should be careful of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, even though the most modern methods will be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that the Hungarians are keen on developing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is very deeply located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the safeguards that they have taken, not one casualty has been suffered in the mining and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at that tremendous depth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives an indication that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is on the move, that the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are participating by agreement, that much good will come to them and that, eventually, the project will bring a tremendous return to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not only bring a tremendous return to Australia, but also for those nations that are going to buy our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it will mean a considerable relief of their energy problems, because many of these nations are starved of energy now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the day must come when the reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are eventually expended, although goodness knows when that day will be because I think the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will continue for many decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note a report in the Melbourne  Age  today that in regard to the signing of the agreement with Queensland Mines Ltd for the development of the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lease, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has not yet approved of the agreement and a licence for the Northern Territory Government has not yet been granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acceptance of the Agreement on an International Energy Program and decisions of the Governing Board of the IEA is to the extent that these are compatible with Australia’s Federal constitution and our policies on foreign investment, the development, export and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, including our policies with regard to nuclear nonproliferation and our policies with regard to the export of other energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw his attention to a question which I asked in this place on 7 March 1979 and which dealt with environmental problems at the Northern Territory Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the development of natural gas deposits, the proper and controlled exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, trie development of coal, et cetera, are all proceeding with expedition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave two islands to the Aboriginals, an area in common, but refused their rights apparently because the mining interests wanted to build a deep sea port for the shipment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the opposition of the South Australian Labor Government to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, is it likely that the world’s largest copper-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit at Roxby Downs will not be developed, especially in the light of last Wednesday’s announcement of the discovery of high grade copper at <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, would this be a bitter blow to South Australia’s hopes for industrial development, the blame for which could be laid solely at the door of the Australian Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunately a fact that that policy, which does not approve of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, is being continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (b) of that sub-clause could be directed against me because I have dared to try to challenge the decision of the Government by marching in the streets to oppose the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Government’s decision to have more than one <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operation in the Northern Territory at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: How often does the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council propose to meet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the reports be laundered before they reach the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether there would be more than one <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine in the Northern Territory, it is not for me to comment upon that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator asked about a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> advisory committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> advisory committee to which the honourable senator referred, whichever one it is, is certainly not within my portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question raised in that regard was whether the reports of the Supervising Scientist will be laundered in any way before they are put to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> advisory committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental evaluations appear to me to be producing some requirements of those who will be involved in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the terms in which ‘subversion’ is currently defined, the Bill could well be used against people who are opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> rnining group were to obstruct the activities of a mining company which had an agreement with or was in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, those activities would come under the definition of ‘subversion’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Explain to them the danger of nuclear war and how the unions want the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> kept in the ground so that their future may be safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate may recall that the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry made several recommendations, one recommendation being that if possible the national park should include at least one large total river catchment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any intention by the Government to increase the size of Kakadu National Park beyond that recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the most pan the direct supervision and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments in the Region is being undertaken by officials of the Northern Territory Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is occurring at the present time at Ranger, and I am informed that Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines is co-operating with the Territory and Commonwealth authorities in meeting the environmental requirements imposed on the company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be understood that the environmental controls under which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is permitted to proceed in the Region are extremely comprehensive and detailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Government has enacted legislation dealing with water, soil, radiation and general aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, in order to implement the strict environmental controls that that Commonwealth has imposed on mining in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Northern Territory Government will eventually be involved in the regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory legislation provides generally for the supervising authorities to, issue permits, licences and authorisations, on the application of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies, for the variety of separate activities which the mining companies will be engaged in in the mining and milling processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think the honourable senators will agree that the question of where the Supervising Scientist resides is somewhat irrelevant in the light of the arrangements that the Government has made, with the co-operation of the Northern Territory, for the supervision of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in 1977 the Government’s controversial and, I think, totally unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy was published by the Australian Government Publishing Service in the form of an information kit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> energy was continued and a fullscale plant was established in Canada, under the directorate of Tube Alloys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia sought to become a member of the agreement as it had the scientists, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>America was not prepared to accept Australia as a party to the agreement as America had secrets which were worth millions of dollars and Australia did not have the security to guarantee the secrecy of the discoveries that were made about the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that the Department is now completely tied in with the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners and that the land rights policy enunciated a few days ago by the Mining Council is now the policy - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the results of that inquiry are less than satisfactory, will the Government cancel its agreement to sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we are concerned about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular I want to make a call again as the Labor Party has consistently done over a lengthy period for the banning of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is not prepared to go that far it should at least call a moratorium on the development of the new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We called for a lengthy period of debate on the matter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that one of the big potential markets for our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore is the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So those people who have been trying to convince the Australian people- and I am talking now about the so-called pro-nuclear experts- over a long period that it is for the good of this country that we should mine our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are probably amongst the minority of people in the world who are totally dedicated to mining without realising that the safeguards have not been properly carried out, will not be properly carried out and that major accidents may happen around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have vast deposits of shale at Julia Creek and at a place near Gladstone but we insist on manipulating our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market for the sake of supplying other countries- and I will say something about what is proposed as far as Australia is concerned shortly- which say that they need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is a very short-term remedy in the world energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A nuclear reactor is part of a sealed system, in which the core of enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is kept in a state of controlled fission whose temperature of which is governed by a closed circuit of pressurised water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But those who want to use <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the production of power tell us that there cannot be human errors in spite of the accidents that have happened at various nuclear power plants around the world, and that there can be no technical failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not sure that the Prime Minister ought to be in possession of that document, because I do not know that he is trustworthy enough to be in possession of such a dangerous document, in view of his attitude to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Philip  Baxter and  Sir Ernest  Titterton are the two people in this country who have spread the same story for years and years: There is no danger associated with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; there is no danger in constructing nuclear reactors; in fact, there is no danger at all so far as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plant was built by the Westinghouse company, a company which was able to say in 1975 that it would be able to get <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia because there would be a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further story has been circulating- I think it has some substance- that the Metalex Yabula company, which is having a great number of problems in mining less than high grade nickel ore, might be converted at a later stage to become part of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great problems of the present Federal Government is that it is not prepared to be frank with the Australian people about what it proposes to do concerning the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> except in respect of those areas where it has already declared itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has said that there should be no further mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country until such time as we are convinced, totally, that there will not be the possibility of a nuclear accident, that there will not be the possibility of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being used for other than so-called peaceful purposes and until such time as we can dispose of nuclear waste in a safe manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that the Government is not prepared to go as far as banning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining but in addition at least it should declare a moratorium on mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at this stage in order to ascertain whether it is worth while going ahead with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two Premiers,  Mr Petersen  in Queensland and  Sir Charles  Court in Western Australia, ought to have pressure applied to them by the Federal Government to prevent the planning or establishment of a nuclear reactor plant in Western Australia, and the planning or establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important consideration in the Government’s decision to permit the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was its recognition of the need to supply essential sources of energy to a very energy-deficient world at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt about the fact that this Government was left a legacy by the Whitlam Labor Government of a 50 per cent interest in the largest <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine in Australia with the obligation to provide 75 per cent of the funds for the development of the mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan provided detailed environmental conditions which should be observed if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its acceptance of the major recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and in 1978 the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act was amended to give effect to the decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to page 1 of his statement in which he indicated that a plan to provide detailed environmental conditions which should be observed if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined was taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Charles  Court indicated in recent days that he may be prepared to allow the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the West in a desolate area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside the environmental aspects of this question, if I were forced into a corner I would agree to the proposition to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Western Australia if I could be guaranteed that the whole of the Kakadu National Park would be declared off limits forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto the Government has informed Parliament of arrangements for the sale of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and it is expected that it will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, in its second report, recommended that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year and again last month I raised in Question Time the matter of inadequacies in the siting and construction of a nuclear reactor in the Philippines which, in terms of our contract with that nation, would be fuelled with Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and hence, in terms of our nuclear safeguards agreement, is or should be a matter of direct and urgent concern to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the results of that inquiry are less than satisfactory, will the Government cancel its agreement to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as this party learned from the independent judicial review of  Mr Justice  Fox and the other commissioners that its previous attitude towards the exportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was illfounded, so we have learned from the Hope report that our previous trust in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was equally unfounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977, the Government announced its policy that development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit would proceed on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Whitlam Government and Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his Budget Speech of 15 August 1978, the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  noted that a certain proportion of the Commonwealth’s share of the costs of developing the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits would be raised by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission through borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the opposition of the South Australian Labor Government to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, is it likely that the world’s largest copper-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit at Roxby Downs will not be developed, especially in the light of last Wednesday’s announcement of the discovery of high grade copper at Benambra in Victoria by Western Mining Corporation Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, would this be a bitter blow to South Australia’s hopes for industrial development, the blame for which could be laid solely at the door cf the Australian Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present South Australian Government’s policy with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining it appears that it would not bc possible to develop the Western Mining Corporation’s Roxby Downs copper-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that it would be impractical to recover the copper without also extracting the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exploration to date has indicated a major deposit of copper-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore containing some gold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the South Australian Government’s present <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy will deny that State the very substantive economic benefits, including jobs, which the development of the Roxby Downs mineral deposit could bring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement has recently been concluded, opening the way for negotiations for the supply of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an exchange of letters between  President  Marcos and the Prime Minister, Australia has undertaken to be a reliable and reasonable supplier of energy to the Philippines, and to give technical and other assistance to help the Philippines develop its own energy potential, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Why has the linchpin for the protection of both the Aboriginal people and the environment at the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mine site, that is, the declaration of the Kakadu National Park, not been enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Statement set out in detail the various steps which have been taken for the protection of both the Aboriginal people and the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region since the government announced its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> decision on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first corrects a simple error in the calculation of the size ofthe Ranger project area subsequent to the adjustment to the southern boundary in accordance with the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry’s recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that the Federal Treasury advised the Government that it ought to go for a 10 per cent royalty on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Nabarlek, the Queensland Mines Limited project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in central Australia last week and I heard  Mr Paul  Everingham, the Majority Leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, say in effect that the Federal Government was a bunch of crooks for the way in which it was handling things in relation to the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provinces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This choice was not given to Aboriginals in relation to Ranger or other areas which were mentioned in the Fox Report on the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is questionable whether the mining of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits was ever agreed to by those people on the Aboriginal Land Council who had the right to do so- those people being the tribal elders or the owners of the land- or whether the agreement was rushed through the Aboriginal Land Council without meeting the requirement of obtaining the consent of the traditional owners of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is found on my block of land and it is mined, I will not receive royalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in North Queensland and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area should not be proceeded with on the following grounds: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore exposes workers to considerable danger from radon gases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger of poisonous chemicals seeping into surface and underground water supplies as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore mining and refining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore could pose serious health hazards for persons living in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take all possible steps to abandon or postpone indefinitely the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area, and the construction of an enrichment plant in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not involved in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining programs at the moment, but because of the Government’s ambitions, programs and policies there will be a time when all these people will be involved in some form or other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I was critical of the Minister when  Mr Everingham  from the Northern Territory complained that the Federal Government was holding up things in the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provinces because the development areas were inside national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures appear under these various headings- ‘royalties from manganese’, ‘royalties from aluminium or alumina’, rent on mining lease areas’, and ‘<span class="highlight">uranium</span> royalties’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the projected <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining which is to occur there is then quite a take-off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned when I read on page 5 of the Estimates Committee’s report relating to the Department of Trade and Resources some comments about the confidentiality of information being sought by the Senate Estimates Committee concerning the Australian <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Export Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the side effects of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country will be that when the rich ore bodies are exhausted and the fields are abandonedwhether they are fields of the nature of Maralinga or fields such as Mary Kathleenthose areas will have to be put under constant watch, probably for thousands of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radioactive waste has been found under schools and housing areas because the people who buried that waste many years ago did not realise the danger of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and its derivatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be taken into consideration in the whole of our approach to mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the development of nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the Committee back to the occasion when the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environment Inquiry was presented to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot of work to be done, and if that is the way mining areas are to be left, particularly <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining areas, the people of Australia have a lot to be concerned about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a meeting held yesterday between the State governments and the Commonwealth Government at which discussions took place on the feasibility of establishing a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am aware that the Commonwealth Government convened a meeting which was held yesterday to discuss the feasibility of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very important matter to discuss because, as honourable senators will know, a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry, properly located and controlled in this country, would be very labour intensive and could be of immense value to particular States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand, by inference, that South Australia was represented at the discussions on the feasibility of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been circulated in various parts of Queensland, but particularly in the north of Queensland, where predictions have been made regarding the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant, the mining of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit in the Herveys Range area, the possible mining of the Westmoreland and Georgetown deposits and one or two other deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To the honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in North Queensland and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area should not be proceeded with on the following grounds: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore exposes workers to considerable danger from radon gases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger of poisonous chemicals seeping into surface and underground water supplies as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore mining and refining or <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore could pose serious health hazards for persons living in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take all possible steps to abandon or postpone indefinitely the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area, and the construction of an enrichment plant in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Townsville ratepayers’ action group appears likely to organise Australia’s first local government referendum aimed at blocking <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and processing in their area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The move is in response to plans by the Queensland Government to allow a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining lease at least SO km from Townsville and encourage the siting of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is directed to both the establishment of the enrichment plant and also the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at the Ben Lomond area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the misconception that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> brings vast employment opportunities to an area and many service industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, he is also the Minister for Police-  confirmed last week that Minatome Australia Pty Ltd, which has been investigating a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit at Ben Lomond in Herveys Range north-west of Townsville, will be granted authority to mine the deposit next month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland Government spokesmen gave no indication that the Federal Government- which has overall responsibility for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development- was aware of these moves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was advised by the Federal Minister concerned that no application for export of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had been made and that no application had been made in relation to foreign capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Camm also confirmed that a site near the Yabulu nickel treatment plant on the coastal plain north of Townsville was the most likely location for a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits at Georgetown, at Mary Kathleen . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that members of his family have dissociated themselves from the Liberal Party because of its dedication to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I do not consider the facts that some organisations, including environmentalist bodies, have particular views on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, processing and utilisation, as being in themselves sufficient reasons for their being called upon to provide environmental assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be able to make a contribution to the assessment of the social, physical and environmental problems associated with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but obviously the State Minister has no desire to seek or even to accept its assistance in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to your letter of 14 May 1979, in which you state that it is most unlikely that the comment of the Townsville Regional Conservation Council will be sought on the environmental impact on the proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine development at Ben Lomond, near Townsville ( Mining Lease Application No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said the cause of the radiation was <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore samples from prospect areas north-west of Townsville in the Georgetown, and Ben Lomond (Hervey’s Range) district about 60 km west of Townsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore could present such a hazard before it was used in the nuclear fuel cycle, made a damning indictment of the Fraser Government’s so-called Safeguards Policy . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope all Government senators will take some cognisance of the fact that people in North Queensland are very deeply disturbed about the prospect of additional <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments taking place, particularly in the Ben Lomond area, which is within 50 kilometres of the second biggest city in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are very deeply disturbed about the development or the possible establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant anywhere in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are further disturbed by the resumption of French tests in the Pacific area and we do not propose to have the area of North Queensland become the experimental ground for every <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or nuclear experiment that is to go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mention was made on  AM  this morning that a report from the Department of Science and the Environment indicates that radioactivity levels at Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine in the Northern Territory are higher than was previously indicated, and that the health of workers there may be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report was not referred by my Department to the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1 975 to facilitate the development of a township at Jabiru, which is located in the Kakadu National Park, consistent with the Government’s announced policies on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Kakadu National Park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act on 5 April 1 979 and was a major step in giving effect to the protective measures which the Government announced would be established in the Alligator Rivers region before permitting mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to commence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In keeping with the recommendation of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government decided that the mining town to serve mines developed in the region should be included in Kakadu National Park and should be a closed town with a limited population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Government’s decision in November last year, to allow the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit to be developed, increasing numbers of people are moving into the mining areas adjacent to the park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She had read books such as  Roots  and communicated to people on matters of current interest such as who had been selected for seats in the Federal Parliament and what was being done on the matter of mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources seen a statement by the Saskatchewan Minister for Mineral Resources, in which he advocated the rapid development of the newly discovered <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in that province, saying: ‘If we don’t provide it you’re going to get some banana-State government supplying it that doesn’t have a non-proliferation agreement’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What effect will that development have on sales of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in future years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers in Australia sufficient long term contracts to safeguard our export situation, or have we, through procrastination and the actions of the knockers, lost for this country millions of dollars of export income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Trade and Resources is aware of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> potential of Saskatchewan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large discoveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have been made in that province of Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years no contracts have been made for the export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, there remains a strong interest in Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as customer countries are anxious to diversify away from existing sources of supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage of the debate it should not be necessary to reiterate the Australian Labor Party’s opposition to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  opposition to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on environmental grounds is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we are not reassured that there are no dangers to the miners who will be mining the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not reassured that there are no attendant dangers in the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The public first became aware of the problems when on 14 May an article appeared on the front page of the  Northern Territory News  headed ‘New Fight on <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Town’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The NT Government is heading for a major showdown with the Federal Government over who runs the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining town at Jabiru. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is worried that any more delays in Commonwealth administration will further hold up the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service also denied the service was delaying the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prof Ovington said the service had ‘bent over backwards’ to allow development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining town at Jabiru . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The battle between the NT and Commonwealth Governments over control ofthe Jabiru <span class="highlight">uranium</span> town spilled over in the Legislative Assembly today when a ‘political’ bill passed all stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Collins said it had always been the situation that Jabiru and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was subject to Kakadu park management, and the Opposition believed it always should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining is the responsibility of the national Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would rather Jabiru was not being built, as it is, to be part of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The park comprises some 6,000 square kilometres and contains within it the township site of Jabiru as recommended in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation which I think initially is important is drawn from page 2 19 of the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, it always amazes me that people single out for criticism <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 make no excuse for the way in which Rum Jungle was mined for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> some 25 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days mining, whether for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or any thing else, was not subject to environmental control, nor did people take the interest in their country which they do now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite true that when the Australian Atomic Energy Commission mined <span class="highlight">uranium</span> some 25 years ago it did not engage in the safeguards and the environmental controls that are engaged in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people harp on whether <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This interests me when I think of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining that has taken place at Rum Jungle and Moline in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Sunday in Darwin I talked to  Mr Joe  Fisher who was the manager of the mine at Moline which contained a rich pocket of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one of the first <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have to be safeguards but many of the attacks made on the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have been overdone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I asked a question concerning the problem of radioactivity levels at the Narbalek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine indicated in a report from the Department of Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he could see the co-operation taking place now between Northern Territory public servants and their Commonwealth counterparts in the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fields, and so on, he would see that these matters which worry him are just a dream, a figment of his imagination, or just plain mischievous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has entrusted to the Northern Territory regulations concerning the mining, milling and transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few years ago it was suggested that there should be an inquiry into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development and mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this was after  Mr Whitlam  and his three Ministers had signed an agreement with the Peko-EZ company for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a complete inquiry into the area of the Kakadu National Park and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this inquiry into the development and preparation for the orderly control and development of mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was taking place, there were constitutional changes being planned in the Northern Territory which involved the giving of powers to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason or other,  Mr Justice  Fox did not at any stage touch on the constitutional changes that were developing side by side with the proposal to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills came before the House of Representatives and the Senate, the people of the Northern Territory had absolutely no say in relation to these Bills which related to the Kakadu National Park and the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we will find that, with the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the various mines of Pancontinental, Queensland Mines at Nabarlek, and Peko-EZ at Jabiru, that there will be sufficient people including the people who will service the various businesses in the town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between him and the Federal Government we will see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> developed for the benefit of not only the Northern Territory but also Australia as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After detailed examination of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry recommendations, the Government announced its decisions with regard to Jabiru town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in North Queensland and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area should not be proceeded with on the following grounds: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>3 ) The danger of poisonous chemicals seeping into surface and underground water supplies as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or mining and refining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore could pose serious health hazards for persons living in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take all possible steps to abandon or postpone indefinitely the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area, and the construction of an enrichment plant in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On Monday at Question Time  Senator Kilgariff  asked me a question relating basically to the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine and the problems that may exist there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Collins’ reference to the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council as the Commonwealth watchdog on these matters’ betrays a lack of knowledge of the arrangements that have been established for the protection of the environment and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> workers in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council is an independent body of people representing a broad cross section of public and industry interests with the function of advising the government and reporting annually to Parliament on the export and use of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, having in mind the hazards, dangers and problems which may be associated with the production of nuclear energy and the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry in Australia, including exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry under the chairmanship of  Mr Justice  Fox, the health and environmental aspects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining are regulated under applicable Northern Territory law but the supervising scientist for the Alligator Rivers region, who is appointed under Commonwealth statute, has an overall supervisory and co-ordinative role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is advised by a co-ordinating committee comprising representatives of all bodies and agencies with an interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the region including the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Government to Queensland mines for their Nabarlek operations is that they meet stringent environmental requirements attached to the special mining lease which follow closely the environmental requirements imposed by the Commonwealth on the Ranger operation and which are based on the recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> environmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The company must also obtain authorisations from the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy under the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining ( Environmental Control) Act which also has appended to it as a schedule the same environmental requirements that are attached to the special mining lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Only last November the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  walked into the House of Representatives and admitted that the Atomic Energy Act was a totally unsatisfactory vehicle for the commercial exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the introduction of these further amendments to the Atomic Energy Act amounts to a further damning admission by this Government of how inappropriate this Act is as the legislative framework for the development and exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within Australia, particularly as it is claimed to be developed for- I believe this to be the casepeaceful purposes and commercial profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry chaired by  Mr Justice  Fox perceived the contrary- the utterly different context of the late 1970s as distinct from the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rationale for Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development has utterly changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Page 248 of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry second report states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend against the use of that Act for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Fox inquiry commissioners recommend against the use of the Atomic Energy Act as a legislative framework for the development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition states categorically that those sorts of provisions hanging in the air which are potentially available to a government to erode our civil and political liberties and which are understandable in the defence context of the early 1950s have no place in the development of this Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition says that the commercial exploitation for peaceful purposes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> energy resources at Ranger or elsewhere, if it is to be undertaken by any statutory authority whether in partnership or alone, ought to be undertaken by a body with a charter for entrepreneurial activities only- certainly not by the presently constituted Commission within the framework of the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough for the Government month after month, session after session, to ask honourable senators to pass amendments to deal with the obvious gaps within the legislation which was devised for a totally different, defence oriented exploitation of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) the Australian Atomic Energy Commission should not be empowered to raise funds on the commercial market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining until such time as the unresolved problems associated with the nuclear industry have been satisfactorily resolved; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government pointed out in August 1978, there is a need for the Commonwealth to share a proportion of the cost in developing the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits to which  Senator Tate  has referred this afternoon and that these funds would be raised by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission through borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit would proceed on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Whitlam Government and Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now a silly situation in which, under the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> consortium arrangement, the Government has the Atomic Energy Commission out seeking markets for its half of Ranger’s production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost unbelievable that, the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> consortium having been entered into with the Peko-Ez Companies, the Government rather than the consortium is to seek a market for its share of the produce and the companies will do the same for the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All future sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced by the Ranger Project shall be effected by the Commission as agent for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the decision to commence construction of the project, the Commission shall use its best endeavours to sell sufficient <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate output of the project to facilitate appropriate financing arrangements . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have heard two criticisms: Firstly, that the Commission should not be involved in any commercial aspect; and secondly, that commercial aspects should be used to facilitate the establishment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All mineral products, other than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> concentrate produced at the treatment plant, shall be sold by Peko and EZ on behalf of the joint venturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is spelt out very clearly and concisely that the Atomic Energy Commission will be sole agent for the selling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but that the other two partners, the two companies, could sell other minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 39 of that report under the heading ‘Marketing of <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> ‘ it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government at that time was the Whitlam Government-  its agent for future sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from all sources in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commitments for deliveries under the existing contracts held by the Ranger participants (Peko-Electrolytic Zinc) and by Queensland Mines Ltd will be met by the companies firstly by negotiated deliveries from the stockpile of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> presently held by the Commission, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point of great interest when considering the Labor Party’s attitude towards <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is another statement by  Mr Keating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders at times how many members of the Opposition are genuine in their attitude to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Keating  has made it clear that he accepts that many countries require <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because of the energy gap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are going to turn to atomic energy, then countries with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must supply that <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of these energy gaps, because of the need for Australia to play its part in supplying <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and because of the need for us to back up the safeguards laid down by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  soon after we came into power, it has been necessary for us again to amend the Atomic Energy Act so as to allow the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to play its part as a commercial partner with the other two partners in the Ranger consortium, Whilst we are hearing criticism from the Opposition today, this Government is merely applying those safeguards and making the Act efficient so that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission can become an efficient partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is diametrically opposed at this stage to the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to feed an energy-hungry world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to oppose this Bill which would enable the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to borrow money on the open money market to finance the development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit and the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are critical of the Government’s determination to develop Ranger, we are critical of the Government’s use of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for this purpose, and we are certainly critical of the Government for persisting in its efforts to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has to admit that it has struck a problem in that it cannot find a market for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which it wants to have sent out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has hawked Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> all around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Korea has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and has assured our officials that we can export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to that country with a clear conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those words were published in a country that this Government assures us is a non-proliferating country when it comes to nuclear weapons, one to which this Government assures us we can export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with a clear conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has signed the non-proliferation treaty but it is hell-bent on using our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to provide it with nuclear missiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Philippines is a country to which we have agreed to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is little wonder that with the problems the world has with nuclear energy it is not terribly anxious to buy Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Critics have long complained that the federal government subsidizes nuclear power in several ways: by undercharging for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment, by proposing too low a fee for radioactive-waste disposal, and through the Price-Anderson Act, which sets a $S60-million limit on utilities’ insurance liability for each reactor accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere in the world can this Government find a clear, strong area which wants to buy our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly have time to solve a lot of the problems which are concerned with the nuclear power cycle before we need to be so anxious to dig <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground and export it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a government which said that it would not countenance the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to any country which was not prepared to sign strong nuclear safeguard agreements with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So evidently we are prepared to go to the point of agreeing to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> before we even put to the countries concerned the safeguards we require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government is busy using investment resources on Ranger and so starving other areas of industry which offer a much greater job potential than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, what is the position of those few workers who are employed on the site? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A contingent of Nabarlek construction workers, who flew into Darwin yesterday for an arbitration hearing on conditions in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province, were eager to air their complaints outside the hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many, working in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province was the only alternative to retrenchment, followed by almost certain unemployment and queuing for the dole check. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One said publicity given to the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had stirred up an uncertainty about what the future held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To protect <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners adequately we will need more than theoretical estimates of such things as the radon concentration in the whole open pit mine area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it will be mined by people working long hours each day and long days each week over a short period so that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be removed from the mine very quickly and placed on the market very quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> miners all over the world have always been in greater danger than any other miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Joseph Wagoner, special assistant for occupational carcinogenesis at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has been studying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining since that 1 960 beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told in the article that  Dr Wagoner  is angry at the way in which the United States of America has dealt with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The men are subject to low level radiation from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and from the tailings dumps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a need to produce <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those 20 million tonnes of black coal there were present 40 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, 60 tonnes of thorium, 120 tonnes of arsenic, 20 tonnes of thallium, 2 tonnes of mercury, 10 tonnes of cadmium, 2,000 tonnes of zinc, 16 tonnes of selenium, 500 tonnes of lead, 400 tonnes of nickel and 6 tonnes of antimony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill that the Senate is discussing is designed to allow the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to borrow money so that it may enter into a partnership with Peko Mines Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, our policy is to oppose the mining and export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because we believe, after considering as many aspects of it as we can find, that nuclear power, as an industry, is pollutant, dangerous and uneconomic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of  Senator Melzer  and, no doubt, other members of the Labor Party I think that the opposition is based on the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Young  pointed out, the decision to use the Atomic Energy Act and the Atomic Energy Commission for the purpose of developing the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resource was taken by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Young  has pointed out, they had grandiose schemes for the Atomic Energy Commission in the commercial development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not provide permission to mine or develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator said that Australia cannot sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; that it has entered into agreements with only three countries- Finland, South Korea and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>She was completely confused about the actual sales contracts for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the safeguards agreements which are entered into between Australia and other nations at a governmental level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the policy of the Commonwealth Government that Australia must enter into safeguards agreements with any country to which there will be deliveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under commercial sales contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is still a prime aspect of Australian policy in relation to this matter that deliveries of” Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be dependent upon safeguards agreements being signed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also have <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the ability, by way of exploration, to find more and more oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier today  Senator Melzer  asked me a question relating to the Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proceedings in which the judgments were entered were brought by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation against 29 <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers including the following Australian companies: Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia Limited; Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd; Pancontinental Mining Ltd; and Queensland Mines Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proceedings relate to arrangements for the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> alleged to have been made in 1972 in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst certainly not dissenting from anything that either the Attorney-General,  Senator Durack,  or  Senator Tate  has said about this matter, a number of unanswered questions still exist in relation to the conduct by the Government of this whole matter of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation <span class="highlight">uranium</span> litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Maher  makes the point that the real reason for the Government’s legislative and political behaviour in relation to this matter so far has less to do with abstract questions of international law and protection of domestic sovereignty and rather more to do with worries by the Government about the avoidance of political embarrassment that might be thought to flow from an acknowledgement that Australia was indeed involved up to its neck in the cartel of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers in this particular area and an anxiety on the part of the Government to avoid putting on the public record anything about the inner workings of that cartel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Article 43 of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Agreement signed on 9 January 1979 sets out procedures for the disposal of the interest of any party in the project, and provides that before disposing of its interest, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission- which is, of course, the Government body involved- must give the other partners, Peko and EZ, a first right of refusal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far it is proven to hold something like 10 million tonnes of copper and 300,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, plus gold and rare earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, milling plants and refineries would need to be established to separate the copper, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, gold and rare earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should say also that Roxby Downs, if it is not developed, will be the only commercially viable <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine in the world that is not being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for instance, is mining every ounce of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it possibly can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to consider the history of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy in the Labor Party in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main one- the Roxby Downs copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits- is being described as crucial to the economy or the State, particularly since economics commentators have been predicting some hard times in the not too long term future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premier Dunstan is at present overseas on a fact finding mission on the possibility of the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in South Australia, and the ALP has released a draft of a new policy on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An article in the  Canberra Times  of 19 June this year, under the heading ‘Federal policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debated ‘, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Minister for Health,  Mr Duncan,  representing the Elizabeth sub-branch moved to direct branch delegates at next month’s national Labor policy convention to support the current Federal platform on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was discussed there was a battle, and all that the Premier, the Minister of Mines and the others in the Labor Party in South Australia who support the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could do was achieve a holding position and maintain the current policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case,  Mr Peter  Duncan, one of the left wingers in South Australia- he makes no bones about that- made a public statement, firstly, that BP would be wasting its money if it were to invest and, secondly, that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would never take place at Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing we find is that an anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobby was set up within the parliamentary Labor Party in South Australia to oppose anything relating to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many right wingers in the Labor Party in South Australia who support the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that there will be absolutely no <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, no Roxby Downs in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Corcoran  should have stood his ground and fought for what he believes in, including the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are honest men in the Australian Labor Party who do support the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After five minutes of skirmishing, talking about energy problems and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, he did what the Liberals in Tasmania did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether it will ever be decided that the safeguards for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every member of the State Opposition in 1977 supported the motion that as a matter of principle they should not mine or develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Australia until it was safe to provide <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to a customer country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Directly,  Senator Kilgariff  will get up and tell us about the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in Romania and how they are all safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am appalled to find that whenever the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and development in Australia is raised members of the Labor Party throw up their hands in horror and start screaming about nuclear waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to provide jobs in Australia we have to develop the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also appalled that the Premier of South Australia, the Honourable Des Corcoran, should state- he was compelled to do so, of course, by the influences at the trades hall, dominated by the left wing- that he will keep in the ground, in South Australia, 10 per cent of the world’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hardly a ripple of concern was expressed in the papers of Australia about that accident yet if a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry worker tripped and broke his neck in Harrisburg or at another nuclear plant there would be hell to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Beverley deposits, in the vicinity of Lake Frome, there is a considerable amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition talks about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of support for your actions regarding the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment Plant in this area was put to Council on 5th December 1 977 and a motion supporting your enterprise was carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be anxiously awaiting a decision on the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment Plant, and also to meet you in the New Year to further discuss this proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took with me an expert who knows a lot more about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invited  Dr Symonds  to attend the meeting, and the Lucas Heights authorities were very pleased to be able to educate the people of the north to such a degree that they are now satisfied that there are no problems at all associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment, despite the nonsense and the red herrings that are drawn across the trail by members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A member of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment Committee happens to be  Mr Dickinson,  who was Director of Mines when the Radium Hill project was developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Amsterdam, at the conclusion of this trip, he said that, since the decision at the Australian Labor Party Federal Conference in Perth in July 1 977 not to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until the Party was satisfied that it was safe to do so, ‘the question of ultimate safe disposal has altered dramatically’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would create jobs directly and spin off thousands of othersand if it is linked to a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant- there are thousands more again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, reference is made to the moral obligation of Australia’, which is coupled with ‘commercial development’ and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, honourable senators on this side of the chamber must decide whether Government senators are serious when they talk about our moral obligation to the commercial development of resources generally or only when they talk about the commercial development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we on this side of the House object to is the assertion, which seems constantly to come from the Government benches, that somehow this moral obligation embraces also the exploitation of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The urgency motion speaks also of the ‘commercial development of its abundant resources including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some days now we have in this place been discussing, and asking questions about, the proposed sale by the Australian Government of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, this debate is not really an urgency motion about the moral obligations of Australia, as an energy rich country in an energy starved world, to undertake commercial development of its abundant resources including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is purely and simply about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the South Australian elections on 15 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not against the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if we can establish that there is not going to be any harm to the environment or to the people who are in the immediate surrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are not against the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if we can be satisfied that there is some safe way in which to dispose of the waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we saw that we had a moral obligation to an energy starved world, to provide them with the necessary <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, I would be quite happy for us to do so if all those obligations were fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no known way at the moment that we can say that nuclear energy is safe and that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until such time as we can say that, it is pointless honourable senators opposite bringing on for debate an urgency motion, taking up the time of the Senate on a broadcast day for the specific purpose of publicising the South Australian elections to be held on 15 September, and then saying that it is the moral obligation of Australia as an energy rich country in an energy starved world to undertake commercial development of its abundant resources, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, this urgency motion is based purely and simply on the South Australian elections and the Government’s endeavours to have further commercial development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to indicate Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy was announced on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After exhaustive consideration of all the issues, the Government decided that there should be further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under strictly controlled conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia was expected at that time to receive the bulk of the new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> orders placed in the following few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that government approval for the development to proceed had been given to the Ranger, Nabarlek and Yeelirrie <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that Australia’s known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources at the moment represent some 18 per cent to 20 per cent of the world ‘s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer briefly to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined at <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Hill in South Australia and treated at Port Pirie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days a number of people worked in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is far too much made of the illness that can be contracted through <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Bishop  has said, I was in Hungary with him last year and we went to a mining area where <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was being mined at a depth of approximately 6,000 feet to 7,000 feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked what on earth was the matter and what was wrong with the people in Australia that they were not mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Hungary to a depth of 6,000 feet to 7,000 feet there had not been one casualty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant would bring even greater benefits to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a general requirement overseas for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the knockers, both in and out of the Territoryprincipally out of it- <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is making a tremendous difference to that part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is not only because of the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An effect of the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is increased employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said, and will be proved, that the present deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia now measure up to the black oil of the Arab countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the prosperity that will come about through the exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- a prosperity similar to that given to the Middle East countries by oil- Australia can look forward to having an influence similar to that which the Arab nations have in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the knocking of many people, I expect <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will bring prosperity to the people of Australia, and it will allow Australia to assist the underdeveloped nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government parties do not rely on the issue of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to fight an election; they rely on other issues which would be less likely to lose them an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioners of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry outlined in the Fox report their finding that a terrorist group could use reactor grade plutonium to make a bomb which would have good prospects of yielding several hundred tonnes of TNT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Roxby Downs will be mined, regardless of whether a ban is imposed on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An assessment of the values per tonne in the ground is: Copper, $80; <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, $20; gold, $45; and rare earth, $15. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are only 300,000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>British Petroleum knew its value as a copper mine if it was not permitted to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or if it had to stockpile the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and not make full use of its investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern for human lives is the reason that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will not be mined for the purpose of sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not been about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> per se or moral obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democrats will not have a bar of stockpiling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think  Senator Cavanagh  just said, ore can be processed in such a way as to extract copper without extracting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Roxby Downs could go ahead producing copper but not <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but if the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were extracted and stockpiled the pressure to sell it overseas, both economically and politically, would be irresistable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at some examples of what <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has done to change people’s emotions in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably the most corrupt nation in the south-west Pacific and we are selling our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which is going to the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talking about morality, that simply means that we in Australia do not give a damn what the Philippines do with our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or where it builds its reactors or what the consequences are for the people of the Philippines; that is their responsibility, not ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are putting a bomb made from our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> into that source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pakistan acquired every bit of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> through peaceful agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the first or second nuclear agreement we signed for the sale of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was with Finland, which is openly sending its material, our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, the Democrats believe, that going to nuclear power and exporting our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is the ultimate insanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> will provide only some 1 5 per cent of the world ‘s energy needs for 30 years; it will leave a legacy for future generations for 500,000 years, a time span my finite mind cannot embrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Young  had moved a motion today to the effect that Australia had a moral obligation to future generations not to go after the ultimate insanity in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but to seek alternative fuels for the energy crisis which will hit our young in the mid-1980s, I would have thought it would serve the Senate better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Corcoran Labor Government prohibits any development of the Roxby Downs copper, gold and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government, because of its silly, narrow policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, will not allow exploration and development to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Can he advise the present situation in regard to the stand taken by traditional owners in the Oenpelli area of the Northern Territory, who have objected to vehicles proceeding through that area to service Nabarlek, the Queensland Mines Ltd <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in North Queensland and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the Herveys Range area should not be proceeded with on the following grounds: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take all possible steps to abandon or postpone indefinitely the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area, and the construction of an enrichment plant in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a territorian, I have more than a passing interest in the present stage of development, and sale, of Northern Territory <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and I ask the Minister: Is it the intention of the Government and the Ranger partners, Peko-EZ, to continue to market their share of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production separately? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Government’s export marketing policy for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, announced on 1 June 1978, the Minister for Trade and Resources must determine, in advance of companies ‘ making firm offers or entering into legal commitments, the terms and conditions relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> sales contracts, including those in respect of pricing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the third aspect of the honourable senator’s question, I am advised that information on the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project has been provided to all companies and organisations which have expressed in writing an interest in acquiring the Government’s interests in the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is also necessary to bear in mind the extent to which it is appropriate to provide detailed commercial information to parties who may be potential competitors of Australian producers or potential purchasers of Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the coming two years only 1.5 per cent of all the investments that are being clearly foreseen throughout Australia will go ahead in South Australia yet South Australia is the State abundantly rich in natural gas, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, copper, iron and of every other kind of natural resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart altogether from the Labor Party’s record that I have mentioned, just look at its policy in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition senators complain about the failure of the Government’s trade negotiations but their Party, the Labor Party, is opposed to any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> will be one of the major resources of this country and it will be in major demand throughout the world, particularly in 1 980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the newly elected Government in South Australia in agreement with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the State, can the Minister give any indication as to what federal conditions would have to be met, including environmental conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would these have any effect on the beginning of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in South Australia, particularly the Honeymoon deposit, where reports by mining engineers have stated that it could be mined and in production within 12 months? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that as a result of the change of government and the very fundamental change in policy and attitude to mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, planning for the development of these projects will be able to go ahead with some confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export policy will also have to be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just referred to the Government’s attitude on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and to the requirements and safeguards which are laid down and which people will be required to meet in all future developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing is clear: An overwhelming mandate was given to the new Government in South Australia to proceed with the development of industry in general and with mining in particular, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the fact remains that under the policy which was adopted by the previous Labor Government in South Australia in relation to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which policy is the same for the Labor Party generally, there would have been a halt to the development of this resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are figures from South Australia where 19 years has elapsed since we mined <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can give no value to figures for cancer-caused deaths of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners unless the figures are greatly in excess of those for other miners, such as asbestos miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the Prime Minister has attempted to buy his way out of this problem with special bilateral deals such as the one we recently saw in the agreement with the Philippines on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the construction of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in North Queensland and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the Herveys Range area should not be proceeded with on the following grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore exposes workers to considerable danger from radon gases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger of poisoning chemicals seeping into surface and underground water supplies as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore mining and refining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore could pose serious health hazards for persons living in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take all possible steps to abandon or postpone indefinitely the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Herveys Range area, and the construction of an enrichment plant in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the natural resources of Australia and in particular the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits of the Northern Territory should bc exploited by companies which have substantial Australian interests so that the benefits accrue to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of a decision to sell the interest of the Australian Government in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining project, ensure that the sale of such interest be only to Australian buyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Attorney-General and refers to the petition lodged this afternoon by  Senator Kilgariff  which expresses the concern of citizens living in the Northern Territory about the ownership of Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister that, in reply to my question concerning possible overseas involvement in the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, asked on 29 August, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>participation in a joint JapaneseAustralian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Wriedt referred to answers which I gave to questions in this Senate regarding the Government’s decision to call for tenders, so to speak, or to call for applications from people interested in purchasing the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the recent debate by the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should pass unnoticed by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the prejudices and plain ignorance that dominated the ACTU debate, it is not surprising that the proposal to lift the bans on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost twice as many people are in favour of exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as are opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the poll, the failure of the State Labor Government to develop the Roxby Downs <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits was a major issue, and the result was a decisive rejection of the Labor Party’s attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our immediate issue is whether we should mine, mill and export our very rich deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To leave our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground, as some would have us do, would deprive our children of their birthright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the dangers to the people of” Australia are concerned, there has been a feeble and absolutely false attempt to paint <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining as dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But imagine the outcry there would have been from the lunatic fringe if such casualties had occurred in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been some attempts which I cannot believe are made honestly to take figures of injuries suffered in the past in underground <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and suggest that these can be applied to our present and proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, all of which are open cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the special risks of any underground mining, in an underground <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine there is the additional risk of radon gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The risks of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> open cut mining are well established, and they are the lowest of any of the available sources of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is that the linkage between the radiation received and subsequent cancers is one of the most intensively studied of all medical phenomena, and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners receive a very low dose, far below the threshhold level of danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> is not in fact a very radioactive substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> miners receive a radiation dose far below the level where there are any detectable health consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, to be fair the opponents of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining do not concentrate very much on the obviously phoney dangers inside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say at the outset that, if I thought that Australia, by refusing to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, could in the slightest degree reduce the risk of nuclear war or the spread of nuclear weapons, I should be the most ardent advocate of leaving <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many sources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world; we have no monopoly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>India has exploded a nuclear device using indigenous <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no future in attempting to control the spread of nuclear weapons by controlling the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we should be doing is not wasting our time on the hopeless task of trying to control the availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but instead should concentrate on the preventionof its enrichment into weapons grade material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is feasible and we can have an influence provided we are involved in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yellowcake, which we are exporting, is <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide- U308. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great bulk of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in yellow cake is U238. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 0.7 per cent of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is U235, the raw material of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although light water reactors use a non-explosive fuel, low enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> of 3 per cent, at the other end of the reaction, the spent fuel removed from the reactor does contain explosive materialplutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the plutonium and unburned <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are removed from the spent fuel, recycled as it is called, there is a potentially dangerous situation because the plutonium could be used by national governments for nuclear weapons or perhaps could be hijacked by terrorist groups for the same purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that senators can see that if we want to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, as I am sure we all do, the sensible approach is not to try to control the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- that is a hopeless prospect- but to control the key points, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment and the recycling process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency should now be given monitoring responsibilities over the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to make certain that highly enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- the 90 per cent level, the bomb material- is not being produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a major <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exporter, we have a unique chance to influence these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our safeguards policy on the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a good start, but we must now go further and make the IAEA an effective monitoring body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we bury our heads in the sand and refuse to export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we will be throwing away that unique opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Export or perish is a particularly appropriate slogan if applied to our export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put simply, the table shows that the estimated number of deaths for the production of 10 gigowatt years of energy would be: Coal, 800 deaths; oil, 700 deaths; wind, 450 deaths; solar or space heating, 95 deaths; <span class="highlight">uranium</span>  8h  deaths; natural gas  2Vi  deaths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coal is 100 times as dangerous as <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; wind is 60 times as dangerous; and solar power is 12 times as dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there would be dangers if the recycling of reactor waste to extract the plutonium and the unburned <span class="highlight">uranium</span> became common, as there would be dangers if the fast breeder reactor which uses plutonium as a fuel were widely introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the late 1 940s, the proven reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United States were only 2,000 tons- about enough to run one large reactor for 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the belief that the world had very little recoverable <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it was felt that nuclear power would not be available on any large scale unless the plutonium were recovered from the spent fuel and reused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, it was widely held that it was important to build reactors designed to breed plutonium, in order to use the available <span class="highlight">uranium</span> more efficiently- in fact, 50 times more efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The massive discoveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> around the world have changed this picture enormously, but the consumption of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has risen, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are still uncertainties about the availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political stability of South Africa, which is a major producer of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must be in doubt, and overseas authorities must look at Australiapotentially a much larger producer than South Africa- with many doubts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no mistake: If there are doubts about the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, countries will not give up nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will force them into the plutonium economy so as to make better use of the limited supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can make a major contribution to stopping it happening by making our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> readily available to countries which are prepared to accept proper and enforceable safeguards in its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delays are caused by disputes about the fuel cycle, whether the wastes should be solidified as they are, or whether the plutonium and unburned <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be extracted first, as is done in the French plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will not be extracted only if the world is assured of the ready supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the chance to have a major influence on this decision, possessing, as we do, something like 20 per cent of the noncommunist world ‘s resources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the facts are as decisively in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> power generation as I have suggested, where does the Opposition get its arguments from? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no coincidence that here in Australia the Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining has been taken over by the Moscow line communists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no dispute that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export will create many jobs and will effect a substantial improvement in our balance of payments at a time when we will desperately need something to balance our oil import bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A responsible government must make the decision to make our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available for the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly recommend that we should mine and export our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and I hope the Labor Party and the trade union movement will re-examine their policy rationally and honestly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development noted that the new South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy,  Mr Roger  Goldsworthy, has announced that he will give approval for the development of the Honeymoon <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit at Lake Frome almost immediately? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister realise that South Australia possesses approximately 10 per cent of the world ‘s <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the determination of the new State Government to develop the State’s resources, and bearing in mind its strategic position, will the Federal Government negotiate with the State to establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in South Australia, which I believe could be ideally situated at Port Pirie? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that South Australia has some very rich and promising <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits, and it is pleasing to see that the new Government is taking some active steps in regard to their development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question the other day, I mentioned that there will be a need to meet the Federal Government’s requirements as far as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant is concerned, any further consideration of that also has been stalled in recent years because of the policies of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Efforts were made in this chamber last night by the blatant <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobbyist,  Senator Hamer,  to assure the Senate that practically all fields in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and nuclear industry are safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He even claimed that windmills were more dangerous than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to this morning’s Press report concerning the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s ordering the immediate closure of an atomic fuel fabrication plant in Tennessee, which reported the loss of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> suitable for making nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of other reports from America and in Australia of a high incidence of cancer among <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners, does the Government not see- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am talking about safety in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are getting assurances from the Government that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole question of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia was examined exhaustively by the Fox Royal Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for National Development: Is consideration still being given to the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that South Australia was the leading Australian State on research into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment, having had a specialist committee working for some four years on activities including holding discussions with URENCO/CENTEC, a British-Dutch- West German consortium and a world leader in the centrifuge system of enrichment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister have discussions with the new Government in South Australia on the possibility of establishing an enrichment plant in South Australia, where so much research has been done and where there is now full support for the establishment of an enrichment plant and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is pressing ahead with conducting feasibility studies with foreign governments and organisations which have expressed interest in the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended that, in the course of undertaking a proposed feasibility study, there will be ample opportunity for South Australia and other interested States and the Northern Territory to discuss fully with industry and the Government the feasibility of establishing a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The South Australian Government has a committee, known as the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Does the summary manner in which criticism is dismissed by the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Jabiluka <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> project recently issued by Pancontinental Mining, comply with the spirit and intention of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. particularly in view of the fact that criticism by the Friends of the Earth was based on months of research: and consultation with Professor Kerr of the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to a statement made this week by an officer of the Department of Health that the Department had made health checks on several hundred miners working in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> areas of Rum Jungle and Moline some 25 years ago; that there appeared to be no illeffects from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at that time; that the checks had continued until the late 1960s; and that the results had been deposited in the archives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this undertaking by Japan clearly support statements made by many realistic people throughout the world that if countries are really concerned about the future supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they could obtain it from the sea at a price? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would not this later seawater project by Japan rather dampen the spirits of the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining group in Australia and make some of the more radical look rather wet behind the ears or all at sea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I am not fully aware of the technicalities of the process of obtaining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from seawater, I understand in general terms that that can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I agree with  Senator Young  that it does emphasise the importance of Australia ‘s developing its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources because of the likelihood that, in the long run, there may well be alternative supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a question I asked in this chamber on Tuesday, 18 September, in which I referred to the  Nationwide  program of 30 July in which it was stated that the South Australian Government had released the report on the deaths caused by cancer of former miners at the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine at Radium Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very doubtful whether the study would have any application to present-day <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department also made an analysis of underground miners other than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners for the years 1968 to 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was discovered that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> throws off a radium gas which is heavier than air, which makes it realistic that open cut mining is more dangerous with its related problems of radium gas than underground mining with a good ventilation and blowing system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it correct that the Government has approached Australian and overseas corporations seeking an expression of interest in the purchase of the Government’s share in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to stress the point made by  Senator Durack  that the Government has not made a decision to dispose of its interests in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capital cost of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Project is presently estimated to be approximately $320m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Australian Government’s decision to sell its share of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project and the discussions which the Government has had with a number of companies concerning the sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without wishing to ask him to reveal any confidential information as to the price, et cetera, I ask: Under what terms and conditions is the Government offering its share of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project to these companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that if the Government has had any discussions at all, it must have determined whether in actual fact it intends to ask for a cash lump sum or whether it intends to permit the sale of its share of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project to be done over a period of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made it clear to all companies and organisations which have formally expressed an interest in submitting a proposal to acquire the Government’s interests in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Project that I am prepared to receive proposals which contain alternatives or options for consideration by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the second part of the question is concerned, the declaration of Kakadu National Park arises from the Government’s response to the recommendation of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry that a major national park in the Alligator Rivers region should be established under the National Parks and Wildlife Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Acting Treasurer announced yesterday that approval had been given under the Government’s foreign investment policy for the Western Mining Corporation and the British’ Petroleum group to undertake detailed exploration and development of the Olympic Dam copperuraniumgold prospect located on Roxby Downs station in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision was reached after detailed examination of the proposal by the Foreign Investment Review Board in terms of the guidelines for foreign participation in new natural resource projects, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government considered that the arrangements satisfied the criteria established in the Treasurer’s statement of 10 June 1979 relating to the development of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects, although it recognised that that project was not exclusively a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was saying, the Acting Treasurer said yesterday that the Government’s approval was without prejudice to the rights of the Government to exercise control over the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources and concerns the dangerous, uneconomic and impractical proposals of the Tonkin Government of South Australia to market the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by-product of the Roxby Downs copper, gold and rare earths field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister note an editorial opinion in the  Australian  on Tuesday that ‘coal- not our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- is emerging as the wonder fuel of the 20th century’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that on the best possible estimates there will be a world oversupply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide for at least the next decade of as much as 20,000 tonnes a year by 1985? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it not prove difficult to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide even at that price which is one which would barely cover the cost of production in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these economic factors, will the Government now use its influence to persuade the Government of South Australia to support the recently expressed policy of the Australian Democrat Legislative Councillor,  Mr Lance  Milne, to mine copper, gold and rare earths at Roxby Downs and to return the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore to the ground as mine fill, as is being done elsewhere in the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition referred to by  Senator Mason  of somehow extracting the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and putting it back in the ground would be the most impractical proposition I have ever heard expressed in this Senate, and I have heard some pretty queer propositions from the Opposition as far as development is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a multi-mineral resource, of which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is only one part, and its development will provide a tremendous boost to the South Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development seen reports of further significant finds of minerals, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, copper, gold and rare earth, some 1,600 metres south of recent significant discoveries at Roxby Downs mine in South Australia, which have greatly increased what had already been described as massive reserves, larger than the area of the city of Melbourne? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not seen the specific warning by the Australian Labor Party spokesman to which the honourable senator has referred, that is, that that Party would not honour any contractual arrangements in relation to the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that companies may enter into in respect of the Roxby Downs area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am not surprised to hear that such a warning has been given, because it has been given on other occasions by the Australian Labor Party, in line with its policy of trying to prevent the development and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources aware that extraction costs of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia are lower than those of most of our known resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is said that at $30 per lb we have 25 per cent of the world ‘s reserves, but that at $50 per lb our share drops to 8 per cent and at $100 per lb our share is almost negligible because <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be extracted from the sea for less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the price of the fuel plays an important part in whether nations turn to the use of dangerous plutonium, will the Minister agree that this nation has a responsibility to supply the world with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a reasonable price to ensure that the use of breeder reactors is kept to a minimum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there are other responsibilities which we have as a government and a nation and which are expressed in the safeguards of one kind or another contained in our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator is correct in saying that radon gas is a breakdown product of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but that does not mean that open cut mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is more dangerous than underground mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the ore body of the Western Mining Corporation’s copper and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> field at Olympic Dam on Roxby Downs sheep station in South Australia extends for more than 30 kilometres inside the security zone defined by the United States and Australian defence authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To make the statistics complete, I also ask whether she will supply the statistics, as revealed in the report from which she was quoting, on the deaths of underground miners in Australia other than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners from 1968 to 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of this and other questions which have been raised since the Government produced its nuclear safeguards proposal, will there now be a reexamination to ensure that those safeguards are adequate for the health and welfare of people involved in the mining, processing and transportation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or yellowcake and particularly the health and welfare of those people who are presently living in the vicinity of the nuclear installation at Lucas Heights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are trying to stop nuclear proliferation, which I am sure is the aim of all of us, what we should be doing is not to waste time on the hopeless task of trying to control the availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but to concentrate on what can be done, that is, to control the process of enriching it into weapons grade material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we try to restrict the supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and artificially create a shortage, we will not stop countries from using nuclear power but we will force them into recycling their nuclear power plant wastes and extracting plutonium- a great danger to the spread of nuclear weapons- and going into fast breeder plutonium reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has seen reports that now even China and some other major trading countries are doing extensive research into the extraction of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the sea because, as has been stated, an independent and secured <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supply, even from exotic and expensive sources, is to be preferred to reasonably priced but uncertain supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not clearly show that many countries are very concerned about their future energy needs, and that Australia should do all it can to assist those countries by mining its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as soon as it possibly can? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have not seen the reports referred to by  Senator Young,  but it is well known that it may be possible to extract <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly indicates a very widespread demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and the concern that there will be adequate supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the world market to satisfy that demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know how India was able to overcome the restrictions put on its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Canada and produce nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I was in that area I had a look at the extensive total land clearing and other activities associated with the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine, where the No.l ore body is at present being exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every bit of spoil taken from that mine will go through the crusher and will finally end up carefully contained in a rock and earth tailings dam where it can be held because of the danger to the environment below it of the heavy metals used in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> processing, to say nothing of the possibility of some residual radioactivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been left out of the park because the Jabiluka leases and another large area towards the coast are where it is believed- I think quite reasonably- that there is a lot more <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and where further prospecting will take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the leases going to go through that whole area and will <span class="highlight">uranium</span> be mined for the next 30 or 40 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe- and I think many Australians would believe as time goes on- that with the falling market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the dropping price for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and with the damage which would be and is already being caused to the Arnhem Highway by mining operations, it would be a mistake for us to prejudice the Kakadu National Park, an enormously valuable national asset, which could be a world asset and which we have a responsibility to preserve instead of providing the few million dollars which would go mostly to the Getty oil company and to some other foreigners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Northern Territory Government has indicated its interest in taking over the Federal Government’s share in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mine at Jabiru, Northern Territory, to give that Government and the people of the Northern Territory a more direct share and participation in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Territory, and having in mind that the Federal Government is at present reviewing applications from overseas and Australian mining interests which wish to purchase the Federal Government’s shares, what is the present position in relation to the overall matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he seen reports that’ the Japanese Government is spending $6.7m on a project to extract <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from seawater? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this undertaking by Japan clearly support statements made by many realistic people throughout the world that if countries are really concerned about the future supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> they could obtain it from the sea at a price? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would not this later seawater project by Japan rather dampen the spirits of the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining group in Australia and make some of the more radical look rather wet behind the ears or all at sea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of reports that a research project is under way in Japan to recover and make use of the large amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contained at low concentration in seawater, for nuclear power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I understand that construction will begin in 1980 to install a pilot plant to recover 10 kg of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a year from 1983-84. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the cost of producing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by such means on a large scale is considerably higher than for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mined by conventional methods, it does indicate that countries requiring <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for their energy needs are prepared to incur high costs to obtain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This project demonstrates that the nuclear industry will continue to develop whether or not Australia supplies its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the international market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It serves to underline the fact that we should not hesitate to develop our own resources if our economy is to benefit from the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the land rights legislation was manipulated by the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies to reach an agreement which was less than fair to most of the Aborigines in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provinces of the Northern Territory garrulous statements were made by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber about what a fair deal it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some negotiation has already occurred with respect to three issues surrounding the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining plans of the federal government, namely: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In August 1977, the Commonwealth Government announced that it would approve plans for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, including, in particular, the Ranger and Nabarlek deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to adopt a position strongly opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, along the lines outlined in the letter drafted by  Dr Coombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to accept that the Commonwealth Government is committed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, and that the government would be prepared to enforce an agreement on the NLC in the absence of negotiations, and therefore to seek the best possible deal within the framework of reasonable’ negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the government has a commitment to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the technical knowledge and expertise that, to my knowledge, only the Atomic Energy Commission possesses, being applied to a more active extent in ensuring the safety of the increasing numbers of persons who are engaged in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even at Nabarlek, which is processing a very intensive ore body, in the sense that the assay shows a very high <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide content, the greatest degree of gamma radiation incurred by any worker was something like 480 millirems over six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> minesremembering that in others the assay shows a much smaller concentration- the question of gamma radiation although important, is not necessarily the most important consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From the discussions that I had there seemed to be no real monitoring, of which I could see physical evidence, of alpha radiation affecting workers in our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement was made that there was no mineralisation at that point, yet at another place in that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province I was told that especially close to the main ore bodies, there was no question of there not being mineralisation which might create a danger from alpha radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was made in respect of the treble damages suit which the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has brought against a number of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> companies, four of which are Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the fact that three major <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining projects are in operation, it is reasonable to assume, with all the welter of research which is being conducted, that that would be the time when crucial decisions may have to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In time to come, the money flowing to Aboriginals as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> royalties will lessen the need for special programs of assistance but it will not be for a long time yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that he saw fit to come down here a few days ago and lean on the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  in order to ensure that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly had total control under the Northern Territory legislation over the town site in one of the important <span class="highlight">uranium</span> provinces is in itself a pretty poor state of affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got the impression while in the Northern Territory, both from the Aboriginal people and those close to them, that there is a good deal of worry among them about the proposal to increase the amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Kakadu National Park region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned it with particular relevance because this whole question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the park and particularly the declaration of the second stage of the park, which is a sacred place and a place regarded as of great value by the Aboriginal people, is relevant to the degree of trust which we have as a people with the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it going to leave it until the whole region has been scarred and polluted by massive amounts of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government will have to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights Act to guarantee development of the Pancontinental Jabiluka <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following on the report of Justice Fox on the Ranger  <span class="highlight">Uranium</span>  Environmental Inquiry the Government embodied in legislation the proviso that if a mining interest had been applied for before June 1976 on land which subsequently became Aboriginal land then Aborigines could not prevent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining but could merely negotiate terms and conditions of that mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There again, in view of the impending over-supply situation for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, from the point of view of the Aborigines themselves and owners of this land, the Government must assure itself very definitely that there is going to be a financial reward in proceeding with mining at Jabiluka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to the profits which may or may not flow to the Northern Land Council in the event of further development in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province, T can only direct the attention of the Senate and  Senator Mason  to the fact that, under the Act, the terms and conditions under which mining would proceed are to be negotiated by the Land Council, acting on behalf of the traditional owners, with the miner concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the many technological and financial advantages accruing to the Australian community from the construction in north Queensland of an enrichment plant for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, can the Minister define any proven hazards from such a venture? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-78-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only note of caution, which unfortunately came to be prophetic, came from me when under the heading ‘Lure of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> threat to jobs’ in February 1 979 the following was reported: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor  Senator Ted  Robertson has forecast a worsening unemployment situation this year because of what he calls the ‘lure of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was to be the answer, no attempt was made- nothing else was done- to stimulate the economy and the Government has continued its sorry record of total disregard of the problems of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are perhaps attracted by the lure of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the predictions that I read out earlier, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has done almost nothing to help in the situation of Aboriginal unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> has not taken up the slack, as predicted by  Mr Paul  Everingham and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one talks of things booming one thinks of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When discussing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Rum Jungle some 25 years ago, information was given that the Department of Health had checked many miners in those days to see whether the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had had any effect on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a letter dated 2 November from the Minister for Health,  Mr Ralph  Hunt, who described the search of the archives for results of examinations of people who worked in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> field and how he sees the situation at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very heartening letter because it shows that if proper safeguards are implemented in the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, there is no doubt in my mind, having considered the information that is available, that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining can take place without ill effects on those employed in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the question you asked in the Senate on 26 September  191 9- (Hansard,  page 9SS), a similar question asked by you at the Senate Estimates Committee and your letter of 5 October 1979 concerning the examination of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners who worked at Rum Jungle some 25 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will recall that officers of my Department undertook to search archives for results of examinations of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in urine of these miners and this has now been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Samples of urine from the miners were sent on a monthly basis to the School of Public Heath and Tropical Medicine, University of Sydney for estimation of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the archival records of the School have been examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A careful scrutiny of all examinations done has shown that on no occasion the School expressed any concern on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> found in the urine specimen although, on some occasions because of what appeared to be contamination of the containers and wide variations in readings in a particular individual from month to month, some queries were raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information likely to be achieved from such research would not now prove of any significance as in the 23 years since <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining began in 1 956 a great deal more scientific knowledge has accumulated on the ways of measuring exposure of miners to radiation hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Radiation Laboratory of my Department has developed a personal dose meter which is now being worn by all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners in the Northern Territory and the results of these are read each month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not they also clearly show that many countries have decided to go nuclear and will be looking to Australia to accept its responsibilities to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to operate nuclear reactors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eleven tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ablaze released a vast cloud of radioisotopes from the melted fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that he has a funny feeling about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; that he feels that we have to go ahead and use it or the world will fall into disrepair or something like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was asked then to give an assurance that nuclear waste would not be imported for depositing in Australia back from countries which were using Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that if this Government is so concerned about its responsibility for the exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that we can assume that it has the same measure of responsibility if Central Australia proves to be the only place where nuclear waste can be satisfactorily stored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hope that the Government will be quite emphatic and that it will tell any user or potential users of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that Australia will not become a dumping ground for nuclear waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should like to point out that the lobby for the rapid development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia is a very strong one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very big vested interests are involved in it; the same interests that would promote the exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> indiscriminately are the same people who right throughout history have used human beings, have used people up to the limit, and have thrown them on the scrap heap without any responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the issue that we see here is a matter of blatant lobbying which is being carried out by honourable senators on the Government side for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> interests, these people who stand to make millions or billions of dollars out of this industry without the necessary basic preparation for the nuclear era and the accidents that are happening all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by  Senator Coleman  at page 363 of  Hansard  on 29 August indicates that right throughout the whole area of development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry and of nuclear power generation these accidents are happening, and there is a tremendous amount of basic work still to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also like to draw attention to the fact that because we are opposed to the immediate mining and processing of Australia’s vast <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits does not mean that we will always oppose the development of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are finding problems of stealth, of dishonesty, by the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> people who are trying to cover up when they know that this great problem exists and will not tell the public of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer more specifically to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributions that have been made in this chamber at different times have been able to refer glibly to injuries suffered in the past in underground <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, but presumably they mean the high incidence of cancer in former underground <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners at Radium Hill in South Australia when the mine was worked during the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great risk of radon gas associated with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in open-cut mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radon gas is heavier than air and tends to concentrate more heavily in the lower areas of the pit floor, and the long periods without wind and the temperature inversion experienced in the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industries will complicate these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to refer to a Department of Science and the Environment assessment report on the proposed Nabarlek <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project, dated February this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The code of practice on radiation protection in the mining and milling of radioactive ores adopted by the Commonwealth Department of Health sets the radiation dose limits for workers in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quoted just recently during the course of a debate in the Senate that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners receive a radiation dose far below the level where there are any detectable health consequences; yet recent studies indicate that the harmful effects of low doses of radiation may be substantially greater than estimated previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has been associated with a high death rate from cancer since the nineteenth century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These men will have left the industry and probably will have moved to other areas before the health consequences of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining become apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to commend the union for its concern for its members working at the Nabarlek and Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the recommendations of the Report, it seems to me to be absolutely essential that a central register of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> workers be kept so that their future health can be monitored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise these matters because of the attitude that has been taken by  Senator Young  and  Senator MacGibbon-  that this industry will go ahead regardless of the consequences to the human element associated with the production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the development of nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A loud word of warning should be sounded about those people who would advocate the helter skelter, go ahead regardless of the consequences policy that the very powerful financially well equipped <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobbyists are influencing so many people in this place to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As long as I am able to stand in my place and warn people against the hazards and dangers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and nuclear power generation, I intend to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to division 640.3.09 which covers the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council and contributions towards administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council appears to be a council set up by the Minister as a result of the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a council to represent the common people and to advise the Minister on the requirements of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its first annual report the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council complained that the Government did not consult it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes in Government policies relating to foreign investment in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects, reported by the Treasurer in June when he announced the approval granted to the Yeelirrie project is another example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has no knowledge of the long term effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of getting the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> started in the Northern Territory we are hearing quotations from  Mr Hunt  rather than, as I said in my speech, from sources within a State which has the longest history of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are dangers and I do not want to exaggerate them, but the figures suggest that we must move with caution, that we must examine everyone who has been in contact with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that at some time we must make a decision as to whether the risk to human health is greater than the profits we can get from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just ask this question: In future will the Government co-operate with and advise the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council on things that the Council wants to know about for the purpose of carrying out its duties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to division 640.3.06, involving an amount of $37m for the proceeds from the disposition of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> stockpile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will enable me to talk about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and to rebut the uncalled for remarks made by  Senator Young  when he introduced this subject this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The source of that report is Penelope Coleing for the Movement Against <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that in 1 964 at Wood River in the United States of America there was one death from radioactivity in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will say anything, but what we have to bear in mind is that when honourable senators opposite say that we should mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, they are interested only in the mighty dollar, as  Senator O’Byrne  and other honourable senators have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could not give two hoots for the safety of the personnel who live in this community and who have to work in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines or handle <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is using the very high unemployment rate that it has brought upon this community as a scare solution to con the people into believing that if we mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we will solve the economic crisis that this Government has got this country into and solve the unemployment problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that there is no employment of any magnitude associated with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we find repeatedly that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber say here and go out on the public hustings and say that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would provide a solution to the unemployment problem and to the economic crisis, both of which this Government has involved this country in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to dispose of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator O’Byrne  asked, what will be done with the waste if that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is sold overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory is not new; <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was mined in the Northern Territory back in the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They indicate very conclusively that the people who mined <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the open cut and tunnelling method some 25 to 30 years ago in the Northern Territory have suffered no ill effects and the people are still working in their various trades in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a case of the Government parties looking for dollars; what <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory means is jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is part of the future for the Northern Territory and for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In closing I mention this: I believe I heard in the media in the past few days that the unions have conducted an inquiry into the safeguards and the feasibility of workers mining in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that the person who has carried out that inquiry on behalf of the unions has said: ‘Yes, there is every reason for workers to work in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that was asked was that certain safeguards be observed, which naturally they will, and that there will be consultation between the workers and the authorities who are working the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Kilgariff  said, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> means a lot to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining means a lot to the Northern Territory; therefore, we should be somewhat hesitant about interrupting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the records in the archives relate to a time before the value of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was known and before it started to be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that  Senator Kilgariff  could draw upon to justify his claim that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is not unhealthy was a report of  Mr Hunt,  who said that he had held a Federal inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that those figures indicated that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining caused earlier deaths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say is that we should be hesitant about going ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we bring up other figures on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining from paper studies by people who have not been in the business, as South Australia has done, and say that my figures are wrong? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both honourable senators would know that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> question has divided this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an opinion poll were taken today or tomorrow I am quite convinced that the majority of people in this country would indicate that they want to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> remain in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that the people who want to see it extracted are those who hope to make personal profit out of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite who are the greatest proponents of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> probably have amongst their portfolios large numbers of shares in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the excuse offered today is that a lot more is now known about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and such devastation will not happen again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia certainly is rich in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fields and it ought to remain rich in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fields by keeping the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under the ground until we know how to handle it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major transnational oil companies today are becoming deeply involved in the exploration for and exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You allowed them to put over the pro-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> story. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest,  Mr Chairman,  that you might be one of those people holding shares in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You need the people to dig <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter refers to environmental regulatory studies in the Northern Territory pertaining to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply ask: Where, when and how is the Australian taxpayer to receive a return on that $4,713,000 which is being expended in the current 12 months to carry out environmental studies to try to assess what damage may be done as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources aware that extraction costs of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia are lower than those of most of our known resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is said that at $30 per lb we have 23 per cent of the world’s reserves, but that at $30 per lb our share drops to 8 per cent and at $100 per lb our share is almost negligible because <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be extracted from the sea for less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the price of the fuel plays an important part in whether nations turn to the use of dangerous plutonium, will the Minister agree that this nation has a responsibility to supply the world with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a reasonable price to ensure that the use of breeder reactors is kept to a minimum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves (reasonably assured resources recoverable at a cost of up to $80 per kg U) represent a significant proportion of total Western world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are estimated to be about 290,000 tonnes <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or about 16 per cent of total Western world’s reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the natural resources of Australia and in particular the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits of the Northern Territory should be exploited by companies which have substantial Australian interests so that the benefits accrue to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of a decision to sell the interest of the Australian Government in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining project, ensure that the sale of such interest be only to Australian buyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators and in accordance with an undertaking given by the Minister for Trade and Resources in the House of Representatives on 2 1 August 1 979, 1 present a report by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on the Aborigines of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-73">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  on the social impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on the Northern Territory Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Northern Territory as it relates to mining generally, and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this without setting aside the moral aspect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- I wish to make a brief statement on this report about the social impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not been able to study the report for reasons that  Senator Gietzelt  mentioned, but I note that in the statement tabled by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  he does not mention the potential effect on the diet of the people of the East Alligator Rivers region of unfettered <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senate, because it is the area which, for very good geographical reasons, must be used for discharge, drainage or seepage from the tailings dams of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> operations of both Ranger and of Pancontinental Mining Ltd at Jabiluka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The geological accident that nature has provided there in association with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits, I suggest, creates a problem of major proportions to which we must address ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe  Senator Missen  was the only member of this Parliament to raise the possibility that some sections of that Act as used to regulate the exploitation of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit were in contradiction to the sons of principles which should govern the peaceful exploitation of those resources for the development of energy concerns rather than, as at the time when the legislation was originally framed, for the provision of nuclear weapons materials for our allies, such as when Rum Jungle was the deposit being exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of instance where legislation comes into a chamber and the focus is on an element of that legislation- in that case the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits- and clauses to do with human rights and their infringement get lost perhaps in general argument on matters of more public concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Science and the Environment, refers to the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council and particularly to pages 4 to 7 of its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My understanding is that information is not withheld from the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council by any department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that as other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fields in the area are developed the township will be enlarged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of these policies is to encourage capital-intensive extractive industries such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and coal, under conditions which we believe are detrimental to the country as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did Mildren and Partners act for any objectors to the Alligator Rivers Land Claim which was heard during the course of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry; if so, who were the objectors, and what was the nature of their objections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In a hearing of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry  Mr Mildren  argued successfully that the Opitz (Cooinda) Enterprises ‘s leases were of a nature that precluded the leased land being treated as unalienated land; a similar argument in respect of K. S. &amp; C. J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kakadu National Park was declared under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 on 5 April 1979 following consideration by the Government of recommendations made in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Second Report <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Government require, at the time of the application, 75 percent of the ownership of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine to be held directly or beneficially by Australians; if so, what were the reasons for agreeing to alter that requirement <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Government’s present requirement relating to the amount of Australian equity in any existing or new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 10 June 1979 I announced that the Government had reviewed the foreign investment policy guidelines for new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects and had made certain modifications to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously, the guidelines had required that a proposed new project for the rnining and production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should ha ve a minimum of 75 per cent Australian equity and should be Australian controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the modified guidelines, a new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project may be permitted to proceed where it has not been possible to achieve 75 per cent Australian equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal by Western Mining Corporation to develop the Olympic Dam copper-gold-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> prospect at Roxby Downs in conjunction with the BP Group, with interests of 51 per cent and 49 per cent respectively, indicated the efforts it had made to find an Australian partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would point out that the proposal was examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board in terms of the guidelines for foreign participation in new natural resource projects, including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In announcing the Government’s decision to approve the proposal the Acting Treasurer on 9 October 1979 indicated that the Government considered that the arrangements satisfied the criteria outlined above (see answer to (2) above) relating to the development of a new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also pointed out that the project was not exclusively a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a project does not meet the Government’s guidelines in respect of the generally required level of Australian equity (50 per cent in respect of natural resource projects other than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and 75 per cent in respect of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects ) the Government may, where it considers it appropriate to do so, require that the level of Australian participation be increased to meet the guidelines over an agreed period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that this Government will now review its intention to allow sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to South Korea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will require the prior conclusion of bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and countries wishing to import Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under any future contracts . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Agreement incorporates all the Government’s nuclear safeguards requirements for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports and its provisions include proscription of military and explosive use; strict safeguards requirements including access by Australia to the conclusions of IAEA inspections in the Republic of Korea and sanctions in the event of a breach by the Republic of Korea of these safeguards or of NPT obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to allow sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Republic of Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable  Senator will  be aware of the announcement on 9 November by my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Resources, that Peko- Wallsend and Electrolytic-Zinc have, with the knowledge and authority of the Government, signed contracts for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the Korea Electric Company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Northern Territory Government has indicated its interest in taking over the Federal Government’s share in the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mine at Jabiru, Northern Territory, to give that Government and the people of the Northern Territory a more direct share and participation in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Territory, and having in mind that the Federal Government is at present reviewing applications from overseas and Australian mining interests which wish to purchase the Federal Government’s shares, what is the present position in relation to the overall matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not yet made a decision on whether or not to dispose of its interests in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>That, in the light of the Fox reports, the Federal Government should immediately initiate a five-year moratorium on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></li>
