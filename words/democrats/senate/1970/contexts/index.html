        <h2 id="contexts-in-which-the-word-democrats-was-used-in-the-senate-during-the-1970s">Contexts in which the word <strong>democrats</strong> was used in the Senate during the 1970s</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>-The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> congratulate  Senator Scott  on his election to the position of  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It seems from the announcement of membership of the committees that there is no nomination for membership from the minority party which terms itself the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received a letter from the leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in the Senate nominating  Senator Mason  to be a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to state so that it is in the record that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> find themselves in some mild dilemma in regard to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>  I  endorse the remarks of  Senator Carrick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worthwhile keeping it there so that we can have a debate in which all the gentlemen on the other side can demonstrate that they are not <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, that they are in fact totalitarian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the Opposition amendment but I did not think  Senator Gietzelt  went far enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will support the Opposition amendment but we wonder whether it goes far enough because this sort of clause, perhaps unwittingly, embraces the kind of activity which  Senator Georges  and his colleagues are undertaking in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have a position which they would like to indicate on that basis also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not believe that the legislation, as it stands, accurately reflects that report and the public comment on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply wish to acknowledge the support that has been given the Bills by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, and to thank them for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> did not bring forward this Bill as a piece of politicking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is for quarterly indexation of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to associate the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and those people who voted for us with this motion about this remarkable man, Earl Mountbatten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I confess that it is quite possible that I have misunderstood the situation because I am not a lawyer, but for the reasons I have outlined the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will support  Senator Evans’s  amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not really believe and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not really believe that we have anything other than a responsibility to ratify the Covenant because, if nothing else, it is a forcible example that this country can exert in its own region and in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I say on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> that if this cosmetic Bill- for it will be that if it does proceed without amendment and certainly it will proceed without substantial amendment- is to go through in its present weak and flabby form it might as well achieve its primary function, which is presumably a lead-up to the ratification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the amendment to the hilt and exhort and plead with honourable senators to support the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are very sympathetic with the purpose of the amendment moved by  Senator Colston  on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-102-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make some final comments on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on the so called Human Rights Commission Bill because we believe that the point needs to be clearly made that the Australian public is being sold a pup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Republican Party in America successfully copies a lot of what the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decisions which are sought to be made outside Parliament are decisions which <span class="highlight">democrats</span> ought to regard as having no validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Frank  Church, one of the Idaho <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, has made statements showing his concern about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those whom  Senator Mulvihill  and his colleagues; would describe as good social <span class="highlight">democrats</span>; - the members of the Democratic Party - are always outside American interventionists, while the ironclad conservatives, whom they would despise, who provide the management qualities around which the wealth of the United States evolves - the Republicans - are inside Americans who do&gt; not like committing themselves abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the real <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in Australia who can see both sides of the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please, will those great <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr John  Lindsay, the Mayor of New York, despite the fact that he lost the endorsement of his Party - the Republican Party - and was opposed by the party machines of both the Republicans and the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, was re-elected as Mayor of New York in the mayoral elections towards the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many prominent Americans who were Republicans or <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have been big enough men to realise that a basis for a successful Vietnam policy has not been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite are <span class="highlight">democrats</span> they will accept our challenge, grasp the nettle and go to the Australian people whom they are supposed to represent and whom we are supposed to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that the Government should go even that far but I am sure that it knows that the Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in Latin America - 1 mention this for  Senator Little’s  benefit - have gone a lot further than parties which are left of the Labor Party have gone because a climate of fear was created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the curiosities of present day politics in this country that the people who are patently <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and who are leading the people of Papua and New Guinea to a decision on selfdetermination are the members and supporters of the Government and that the people who are adopting the role of the patriarchal, patronising, erstwhile colonialists are the members of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want these people to be given every assistance and I want them to be educated, but I do not think that we can turn them into functioning <span class="highlight">democrats</span> overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators who do not believe me are, 1 would suggest, not <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned these matters just to show the hard type of bargain the socialist <span class="highlight">democrats</span> enforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be well remembered by many that the Suppression of Communism Act in South Africa, which has been responsible for the imprisonment and the suffering of many <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in that country, was based on the Communist Party Dissolution Act which was passed by the Australian Government in”  1950,  only subsequently, to be repudiated by the High Court of Australia and by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am staggered that the alleged <span class="highlight">democrats</span> on my right, whom I have heard plead in this place- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no need for anybody to apologise for those lads who find it necessary to act in the best traditions of Australia’s manhood and I believe that all <span class="highlight">democrats</span> will wish them luck in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have always preferred an honest conservative to a phony liberal and for that reason I think that the Republican administrations have had more intelligent, sensible attitudes to foreign affairs than have the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> who, despite their protestations of world peace, seem to have got themselves involved in more wars than the Republicans ever did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have a copy of the minutes of a European conference on immigration held in central Europe in April and attended by christian socialists, social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and communist trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘If a Liberal man here went to a Conservative group in Britain or if a Labor man here went to the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> should he be debarred from the Public Service?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, if we are <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, we agree that anybody at any time should be allowed to change his mind about politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">democrats</span> we have always subscribed to the referendum system with a view to obtaining the viewpoint of people on any controversial issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these people of the Australian Labor Party who are supposed to be <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and whoare allegedly anti-communist– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Swedish Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> could not have held Government continually for 40 years without a break, but for the fact that they had a fair and honest system of election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First past the post voting, the introduction of which is part of the long term program of the Government, is well worth looking at because those who advocate it have the infernal hide to stand here and claim that they are true <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, that they are concerned- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party have an infernal hide to claim that they are the great <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact 1 wrote an article for one publication and in it drew a parallel with the reforms of the Roosevelt era in the United States of America in respect of ethnic groups and of how those people flocked to the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and returned a long series of Roosevelt administrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable .senators, opposite are the <span class="highlight">democrats</span> they claim to be, would they not want to see both sides put? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Liberals, particularly  Senator Hannan,  will be happy when I say that the Mouvement Republicain Populaire, the Communist Party and the Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have to be allied with all the parties of the Right in France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an extraordinary thing that the so-called <span class="highlight">democrats</span> are now drunk with power on being elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it behoves any people who claim to be civil libertarians and who claim to be <span class="highlight">democrats</span> to raise their voices against the sort of repression which I am convinced is occurring in the Soviet Union at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, and having agreed among ourselves and having undertaken to do so, we will observe that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows in his heart that at that time there were a few people, not in the lower Houses of the various parliaments but in Upper Houses- I refer particularly to those people who masquerade as <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in the Upper House of Tasmania- who did not realise in a time of emergency that Tasmania had to get instant government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that 17 Canadian members of Parliament and senators representing the 3 major parties in Canada- the Conservatives, the Liberals, and the New <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> who are equivalent to the Australian Labor Party- have asked the Canadian Government to support a motion in the United Nations calling for humane treatment for and the ending of the torturing of and other indignities against all political prisoners in South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>If the Opposition is so confident that these are outrageous proposals and that they will get the deserts which the Opposition claims are their due, why do not honourable senators opposite as <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, who are anxious for us to go to the people, allow these matters to go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These great <span class="highlight">democrats</span>-  Mr Whitlam  and those whom he cites for his authority- who state that the Senate is trenching upon democratic rights when it interrupts the free flow of mischief by a government within its 3-year term completely falsify the situation because each House goes to the country for a decision by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen members of a party move through country areas telling country people for decades how disadvantaged they are and at the same time, in a parallel fashion and as a result, they have drawn that countryside down to a position where it has been ridiculed by <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, as I think  Senator Gietzelt  well knows, were people who initially supported  President  Allende into power and they were the people who, when they learned of the excesses in which  President  Allende was engaging, revised the initial views they held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot speak of what the Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have done in recent years but I do know that this particular Chilean Radical Party which the Labor Party is sponsoring is a party which has been outlawed and banned and that it has engaged in activities designed to overthrow the Government which this present Australian Government recognises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that not only the radical party but the other parties which were in popular unity are now being persecuted in Chile by the Facist regime- and I use the term quite deliberately and not in any loose sense- which includes the Christian Democratic Party of Chile, which is associated with the Italian, French and West German Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, who have engaged in similar solidarity with the Chilean Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> as we have engaged with the Radical Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 10 December 1977 the Liberal Party of Australia polled for the House of Representatives 38.1 per cent of the national vote, the Australian Labor Party 39.7 per cent, the National Country Party 10 per cent and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> 9.4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government, supported by Robin Millhouse, who is now leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in South Australia, argued that the Liberal Movement of which  Senator Steele  Hall was a member when he was elected to the Senate no longer existed and that it had been taken over by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could have elected a Labor Party member but to give the Premier his due his justification for the appointment was that he thought he was better expressing the wish of the electors at the time and the referendum decision to change the Constitution by putting someone from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It became obvious to me both as a senator and previously, when like  Senator Mulvihill  I was Assistant Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Labor Party, that the Liberal Party and the Country Party had financial resources which far outstripped the resources of parties such as the Labor Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be called fascist is an insult to all loyal Australians after 25 years of residence here; and that by a socialist party which has been described by one of its prophets, the great Stalin himself- on that occasion speaking of the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>- as ‘twin brothers of fascism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then, in making a most extraordinary alleged quotation from Stalin, said that Stalin had claimed at some stage that social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and communists were brothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no more committed enemy of the social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and of the principles for which the Australian Labor Party stands than was Stalin himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the only reference that I can remember about brothers- and it was certainly not the remark that  Senator Lajovic,  this latter-day Haldane, attributed to Stalin, that social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and communists are twin brothers- is the exchange that once took place between Otto Grotewohl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grotewohl said to Schumacher: Communists and Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are really brothers’, to which Schumacher replied: ‘Yes, like Cain and Abel’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are now with us and will be with us for a considerable number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator JANINE HAINES (South Australia) It is with considerable regret that I rise today to extend my sympathies and those of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to the widow and family of the late  Sir Robert  Menzies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from what she said I gained the impression that she interpreted the results of the past general election as indicating to the Senate and to the people of Australia that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> had something significant to say about the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall the Press discussion on the policies of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> at the last election, it was to the effect that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> had no policy, particularly in relation to matters such as constitutional reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could scarcely say that Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> come here with a mandate- if one can use that expression- on the basis that they have shown an interest in constitutional reform, because that is not so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I hope will happen is that in July when the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> come here in their full glory- I do not wish to detract from  Senator Haines  at all- they will argue the case for a popular convention to consider constitutional issues and not just for a convention which is confined to the sort of grey bureaucrats of politics, such as the Minister and I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend my suggestion to the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> as the desirable policy which they might adopt- perhaps the first they adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking at a public forum organised by the Territory Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on Saturday,  Mr Perron  said: ‘There can be no dispute that our election victory was a mandate to institute the changes now imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> Leader, Senator-elect Don Chipp today urged Territorians not to be ‘conned’ into statehood by Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe strongly in self-determination, but I, Chipp, as a national leader with 1 6 years of parliamentary experience holding 10 portfolios behind me, plead with Territorians not to accept it from Canberra until they have read the fine prim on funding, ‘ he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the principle, but all of the six States and almost every local government authority I have seen in the past 12 months say it’s the sweetest con job in federal history.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those meetings have been mounted by the Australian Labor Party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, various associations, chambers of industry and so on but not, unfortunately, by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All three recognised opposition parties, the ALP to the Left, the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> at the centre and the Progress Party to the Right, as well as representatives of the public servants, the biggest single group of employees and at least one major black organisation have demanded such a poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> I extend to you our very sincere congratulations and my personal congratulations, if I may. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the presence of a new party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, and the other is that you still have an Independent senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to make a statement concerning the leadership of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I advise the Senate that I have had the honour to be elected parliamentary leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and that  Senator Colin  Mason has been elected my  Deputy  Leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to associate the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> with this motion of condolence on the death of Pope Paul VI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel confident that if debate were to encompass the new members of the Senate from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and if in fact  Senator Harradine  were enjoined to vote on such an issue we could count upon an overwhelming viewpoint from this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have taken a vote on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are confronted now with the advent to the Senate of two Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the Labor Party feels that it would be wrong if it were to prevent in any way the inclusion of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in the committee system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think, for example, that if the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> were grouped with the sole independent senator probably, on a proportional basis, they would be entitled to one place on the legislative and general purpose standing committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer briefly to the remarks of  Senator Chaney  and  Senator Georges  that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> should have some modesty of aspiration in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 could not see any sense of value in any claim by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to be represented on many committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ participation in committee work should be restricted to work which can be done with some efficiency and preferably in an area of some interest and knowledge to the senator concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the number of votes received by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> equalled the votes of the National Country Party yet the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> were denied representation in the lower House whereas the Country Party has representation in that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion which has been put forward by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> may be dropped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was particularly gratified to hear the emphasis  Senator Mason  placed on the plight of the unemployed youth in our community, and I expect from his contribution that we will be able to look forward to support from  Senator Mason  and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in this place for active and effective measures to come to terms with the problems of youth unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the thrust of the Commonwealth Employment Service Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not refer to that matter because my colleague,  Senator Mason,  in his maiden speech, referred to the way the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> feel about unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had he given notice of an amendment for the protection of private enterprise in this sector, he would have had the immediate support of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have found  Senator Missen  and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, as three members out of a total of 64 members in the Senate, supporting that amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in this Bill is clause 6 (a), which appears harmless but actually states that one of the functions ‘of the Commonwealth Employment Service is to assist persons seeking employment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> Party are totally in favour of competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By stating that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are firmly in favour of competition and that the best form of competition is for the Government to compete with private enterprise- or the other way around- which prevents collusive tendering amongst private enterprise I think I have put our situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are a private enterprise party- not a socialist party- as I thought the Liberal Party was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that disturbs the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is that there seems to be less and less regard for the small business person in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are supporting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have been saying for 1 2 or 1 8 months is that the home building industry is the classic industry to stimulate for this reason: It is notoriously quick to respond to stimulus; after the injection of money at the right interest rates, it responds very quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is opposed not only by the Opposition and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> but also by almost every person and organisation concerned with this legislation since it was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looks relatively harmless, but the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not believe that it is harmless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument that has gone on is whether the subsidy arrangements which are proposed are appropriate and whether they will produce social effects of the kind that the Opposition and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> allege they will produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> could scarcely oppose this Bill because to do so would be to inhibit a proper consideration of the very important matter that is its subject, and because we also believe that this whole area needs basic rethinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> think this is quite basic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There again, whilst I would not oppose the Bill, the whole direction of this area of public policy worries the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that one great error of government is to tend to monopolise the area of social services or, more accurately, to allow specialised public servants to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators might or might not know, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in forming its policy in this area has tried to consult the community as widely as possible before our suggested policies are voted on by all our members in a secret written ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democrats</span> throughout the history of the world have not fought, and bled and died to overthrow the divine right of kings simply to see us fall down before the divine right of experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that yearly budgets are a disaster and that they are the very last thing that an economy and a society trying to look ahead to the problems that face us and the world need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> agree with the Victorian Employers Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that this does not go far enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> disagree with this system and we put forward two fundamental concepts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are making is that unless we have long term planning to remove party politics and point scoring from this sort of arrangement we will never solve those sorts of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that inflation and unemployment can be tackled simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst tremendous importance is placed publicly upon pure theory, in whatever field it may be, we as <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and free people- regrettably there are relatively few free people thoughout the world today- have to beware lest we become the slaves of some ivory towered conceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are not sure that Australians would be quite so ungenerous as to have only $1 assigned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion is taken pretty much from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> draft policy on electoral and constitutional reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not long after the formation of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> we made a sort of straw poll of nearly 2,000 Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were intrigued by that, and subsequent inquiries by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have indicated that there is a widespread feeling in the community that this question of funding should somehow be resolved, as it has been in many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ idea of things is that we should maintain contact with the electorate and with its feelings on issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If changes were to be made to this very deceitful and dishonest Budget, they could have been made only with the support of the 26 solid votes of honourable senators of the Australian Labor Party and with a couple of votes from the honourable senators of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, who, from the way in which they have asked questions and contributed to the discussion, could have been relied upon to support the changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same issue the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> had this to say about the Budget: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Darwin Branch of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> had described the Federal Budget as dull, unimaginative, and an admission of failure . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not oppose the 1978 Budget, nor could we support  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will not then be blockers purely for the sake of blocking and we will honour in this Parliament the pledges that we made before we were elected to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have no patience with doomsayers nor with the prejudices deriving from what we believe to be the 19th century ideologies of the Labor and Liberal Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are pragmatists and we are proud of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the dangers of this two-party system, of adversaries battling from the two extremes of the economic spectrum, that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> were formed a year  or   ago by 8,000 ordinary Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that is the reason for the presence of a third party- the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industrial relations policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is based on taking the heat out of this confrontation, getting it out of the political field, getting it out of the legal field, getting the disputes away from publicity and at a place where the parties, together with a team of conciliators on whom they can mutually agree, can discuss their problems until a solution is reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have many good trade unionists in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and every day we welcome more as members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe fundamentally in the necessity for a strong, honest and healthy trade union movement which benefits all workers- and I stress the words, ‘all workers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people, I suggest from the feedback we in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are getting, are fed up to the back teeth with this situation and they will not tolerate it any further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very many things about the Labor Party’s policies that are constructive- indeed, we in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> share so many of them- but which will never come to fruition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here are some of the points that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would like to see the Labor Party take up with the union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> mean by industrial democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point that might be clarified with the unions- and here again I know I am speaking in the same way as many other people, but in fact the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> I believe seven or eight months ago were among the first to bring up this point- is their apparent determination to keep tens of thousands of unemployed people permanently out of work by not reconsidering union attitudes towards permanent part time work and the abolition of weekend penalty rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> agree absolutely with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> agree with  Mr Bob  Hawke that the initial answer must be a conference of all elements in our economic and political scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will turn for an example in some detail to what the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> regard as an important possibility in view of the rapidly oncoming crisis in respect of our supplies of petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a higher octane rating and even when it is used at an additive to petrol, which is what the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> suggest should be researched first, it can reduce the need for lead additives and hence also the need for vehicle emission controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are great believers in consulting people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure  Senator Mason  that the Labor Party does not intend to take any advice from a new party such as the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> which was formed by a person who was more or less eased out of the Liberal Party of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the policies of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have been formulated by  Senator Chipp  who was a Minister in a previous Liberal-Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have the audacity to come into this Senate and lecture members of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Chipp  on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> today asked a question on this matter in regard to Victorian railway workers as though they are some son of unique group specially penalised by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will be pleased to support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will support the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Centre Party in Sweden been thrown out of office by the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on a pro-uranium issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are just like those good German policemen, good solid Liberals and Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> who carried out their orders from Hitler after 1933- people who would never have voted Nazi in their lives and who said: ‘Isn’t it shocking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would agree essentially with <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I wish to say that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will not oppose this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would agree entirely with the Labor Party on that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in debate in this place I disagree with my colleague from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it ought to be put on record now that the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>  (Senator Chipp)  said just a few moments ago that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are not going to oppose the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Government broken its promise but also the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is going to break a promise here today on the first opportunity he has to oppose a provision of this Bill which he stood most solidly for in the policy speech of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will have trouble voting with us on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite went to the people in 1975 with a policy speech on social security which no doubt was devised by the present Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>  (Senator Chipp),  and last year when  Mr Fraser  said that the Government would maintain twice-yearly increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I do not want to take up the time of the Committee by covering ground which has already been covered, I think it is worth stating the position of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to be a quite fundamental attitude for any modern society that makes any small claim to being civilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ought to add, too, that this policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> was adopted by our national membership in a secret ballot and that we are the only political movement in this country which does that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the mounting concern which has come to be expressed by <span class="highlight">democrats</span> around the world in recent years at the condition of civil liberty in West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator CHIPP (Victoria- Leader ofthe Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>)-  Mr Acting Deputy President,  I claim to have been misrepresented or misunderstood and under Standing Order 410 I seek leave to make an explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the statement of an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> member of the Legislative Assembly and a member of the committee which drew up the report which the Senate is now considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer I got was that the Independent senator and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether they are <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, but that is another point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim that if an Independent or a member of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is entitled to travel facilities which permit his staff to go anywhere in Australia during the recess, back benchers on both sides should be entitled to the same facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, and no doubt the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, do not have the facilities that both major parties have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course that benefit is not available to me as an Independent senator, nor to the members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that if there is a situation with a particular piece of legislation or a particular government policy which requires my staff member in Canberra- or the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ staff member in Canberra- to investigate in, say, Perth because the legislation affects Perth, then I would rather see him go there than me, not that I have anything against Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thrust of my argument is that if  Senator Harradine  and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are entitled to travel facilities throughout Australia for one of each of their staffs during recesses so too are back bench members of the Opposition and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government recognises that those three people are entitled to two staff between them- that is one for  Senator Harradine  and one for the two Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> senators- and they are entitled to travel facilities during recesses, why cannot the back bench members also be entitled to those facilities for their staff? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> say that the only long term solution of the problem is first to recognise that it is indeed long term, not just a temporary aberration, not just the result of Government policies- although they have contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that no solution can be found to this problem unless all parties get together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that manufacturing industry has to be assisted and protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> recently conducted a survey of department stores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are satisfied that the first requirement we have set down in our policy, that is the safe storage of nuclear wastes, has not yet been met although in some small ways some progress has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision, interestingly enough, was the result of a referendum arising from a citizen’s initiative, a civilised aspect of government that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe ought to be introduced by the citizens of Australia, acting on their own behalf and in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- The Opposition, supported by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, has used this Bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act as a vehicle to debate and to oppose the Government’s policy to permit the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were in fact supported by one Government senator, by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> senators and by the independent senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not accepted by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not complaining about that because the Opposition has been remarkably kind to members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> since we got into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, more people voted for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> than for the National Country Party of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my policy speech in 1977 it was announced that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> policy was clearly not for the restoration or maintenance of sixmonthly indexation of pensions but for quarterly indexation of all pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to break that promise is an act that is not to be commended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My thoughts and those of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on this matter are well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made that additional point which is pertinent to this debate, I repeat that we of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> pledge ourselves to support the Australian Labor Party in any moves it might want to make in conformity with the Standing Orders in an effort to force the Government in some way to honour the promise on which it won millions of votes in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are supported by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Centre Party in Sweden been thrown out of office by the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on a pre-uranium issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have, of course, had considerable feed-back from the Australian public on its disillusionments with parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the major reasons for the existence of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> offices throughout Australia that because of fairly widespread and increasing media and public interest in recent days in the subject there is already an accelerated pace in the addition of signatures to those petitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it certainly very democratic that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber, other than Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> senators, should present further petitions on this matter, and I confidently predict that that will be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have persisted with this matter and why we will continue to persist with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now make the point that it is just not members of the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> who are taking this petition around, but also a number of other organisations in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their members are actively interested and they are taking the petition about and getting signatures not because they support the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> but because they support the idea of citizen initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would only finally commend this matter to the Senate in the sense and spirit in which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> put it forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of a total future plan covering a reasonable time span is one of the most important economic measures so far established as the economic policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> as a result of debate within our organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not too much to say that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, on reflection, feel that this is an essential ingredient of any economic strategy of value or promise for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather baffling to the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> why none of the old parties- most importantly the Australian Labor Party- has not brought forward a motion of this kind, discussed it and tried to justify it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would agree with him absolutely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not under-estimate the difficulties that would be involved in such a conference and this is why it has been placed by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in a rather long time span. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that a good deal of careful planning should go into such a convention in consultation with those who will probably be involved, many of whom as we know are antagonistic to each other due to political colouring of so much of our social and economic life which results from the two-party system of which I have spoken before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, planning on the basis suggested by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would be a continuous process, with continued consultation between the major forces in the economy and society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe in enlightened private enterprise, and I stress the word enlightened’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> it is fundamental that if there is to be regulation it is much better that it be self-regulation imposed as a result of co-operation and consultation with the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are considering closely and we certainly will be raising it in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when one compares the facilities of the New South Wales Liberal Party with the New South Wales Labor Party it is rather indicative of the ALP’s plight and for that matter the present plight of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in trying to compete today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, parties like the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, the ALP, independents like  Senator Harradine,  and the gone but not easily forgotten Democratic Labor Party have to rely on a handful of dedicated supporters while the major Government parties can hire small private armies to help in elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example,  Senator Chipp  and  Senator Mason  might find it interesting that under a system similar to that recommended by the Houghton Committee, their party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, the newest party in Australian politics, would be eligible for a significant amount of state aid in the next election, having established that their party is a popular force and that it had considerable electoral support at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> find the views of  Senator Hamer  on this subject very interesting and refreshing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have not yet balloted it specifically because we have not got round to it, but I would be very surprised if our organisation and our people who are thinking about this area of constitutional and legal reform did not go along sufficiently with  Senator Hamer  almost to be induced to send him a membership form for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I can assure the Senate that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> membership and our policy forming areas will look at this idea and see whether we can formulate policy on the matters that  Senator Hamer  raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I say that I am disturbed to learn that neither the Liberal Party, the National Country Party nor the Labor Party is prepared to support the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those who read  Hansard  and to those who are listening to the broadcast of this debate, might I explain why the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that the reference of a matter as important as this to a Senate standing committee is so vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the operative word in the motion I have moved tonight on behalf of the Australia <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> concerning oil exploration in the Great Barrier Reef area is ‘ area ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he then went on to say- and this significant remark gives the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> great concern: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that it would be catastrophic to allow drilling that distance from the Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister wants that technical knowledge to be obtained, why has he asked his Liberal senators not to agree to the motion moved by me tonight on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are concerned, we believe that the Great Barrier Reef belongs not only to Australia but also to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are even more deeply concerned about some of the more outrageous statements of Queensland Ministers concerning drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of those statements I do not think that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, and those who support this motion, could be blamed for confessing utter confusion about the intentions of the Government or of the National Party on this question of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  amendment is totally unacceptable to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That editorial, more than anything else, eloquently sums up the position of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and the reason that we ask the Senate to pass tonight this motion which seeks to refer this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall speak to it only briefly in order to raise perhaps one question of importance to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> which  Senator Chipp  has not covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have information and knowledge, as I think any perceptive person would have, which indicates that there is a wide degree of concern in relation to this matter in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that we have the Australian public squarely behind us on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Australian <span class="highlight">democrats</span> are opposed to exploitation of the Reef area in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Chipp  has said, this matter is very close to the hearts of the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, as I believe it is close to the hearts of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise the concern of  Senator Chipp  and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I have tried to by sympathetic with the intent of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in moving this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sympathise with the general thrust of it and I hope that what I have suggested will go a long way towards satisfying the concern expressed by the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the intentions of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are honest but I believe that we have investigated the matter and already come to a conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that  Mr Nujoma  ‘s comments relate to differences within SWAPO but I am unable to comment on whether the position of  Mr Shipanga  of the SWAPO <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rude and dismissive response to  Senator Mason’s  proposal might be to say that this is just another example of that cheap, crude, two-bob populism which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have made so peculiarly their own; their tendency to confront complex problems with slogans and simplistic solutions and to do so wallowing in the luxury of the knowledge that they will never be in the position of having to govern, and confront these problems, in their own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I have said quite the opposite, that is, that the Australian media has been impeccably fair to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> since its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> regard the lack of energy policy in this country as one of the most serious problems facing us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in the United States there are <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and Republicans who have changed from being hawks to doves in respect of that war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak briefly to this motion to deplore, on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, a further step along a path the consequences of which we believe the Government has failed to consider in accordance with the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has frequently been put to me and to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> that we might as well sell our uranium because if we do not other people will sell their uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> say that this is a proper and responsible subject upon which the Government should consult the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> say: ‘Let the Australian people decide whether we export our uranium, and let them decide it soon’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that Solarcal is estimated to provide 370,000 new jobs a year up to 1990, so halving the Californian unemployment rate, and in view of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ confidence that the Government is really sincere in its stated intention to reduce unemployment in our country by all reasonable means- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good deal has been said in the Parliament recently about defence- the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> feel, for good reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have made a case for a least some consideration of missile capability in this class of ship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> applaud this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> ask seriously that the Government at least consider adapting five of these Fremantle class vessels to a ship-to-ship missile capability, be they Exocet or Harpoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> give general support to all of these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the purpose of the Bill but have the same concern as the Australian Labor Party about many provisions in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are anxious to speak to the report at this stage because it deals with a matter that is very close to our hearts as a political organisation and because we believe that certain matters should bc raised with the Government before this year’s Budget is framed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some $226m, rather more than half our aid in that year, went to Papua New Guinea, and the’ Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> agree that we ought to fulfil absolutely our obligation to assist Papua New Guinea to prosperous nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret in more ways than one that it falls to the lot of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to be the sole dissenting voice in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> understand also that during the intervening period of more than a decade no major funds are going to be spent on the maintenance of this building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on these grounds that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> oppose the new and permanent parliament house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have already had considerable feedback from the public on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give fair notice that we Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will maintain our opposition if this project- in our view, a quixotic and unrealistic one- is persisted with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government did not do this because the Liberals and the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> which comprised part of the conservative coalition baled out and decided that they wanted to keep the stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following consultation with the Opposition, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and  Senator Harradine,  I seek leave to propose a motion to discharge Orders of the Day from the Notice Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> concur with that view and with the exception of paragraph (j) of  Senator Button’s  amendment to the second reading stage of the Bill, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would largely concur with the views of the Opposition and will be voting with the Opposition on most of the amendments it puts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> take it that the Prime Minister was sincere in his statement yesterday that he wants an urgent review of airport security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not agree entirely with the view expressed by  Senator Evans  on behalf of the Labor Party about clause 8, especially sub-clause (2) of clause 8. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> suggest to the Government that it can strengthen this Bill by amending it to read that ‘the DirectorGeneral is subject to the direction of the Minister’, which seems to us to be a reasonable point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ argument is that if you leave it the way it is you are making it non-specific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, to whom such things are brought, have many cases on our records where people have felt- perhaps wrongly, perhaps unjustifiably- that they have not pursued their rights adequately because they felt they were unhappy about it, that they could be pressured and that somehow they must not run foul of the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> ask that the Government consider this very human situation where it is legislating for one man to have tremendous responsibility and authority and not providing any safeguards whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> extend our sympathy to his wife and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Carrick)  and supported by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Wriedt),  the Leader of the National Country Party  (Senator Webster)  and  Senator Chipp  as spokesman for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, that is like waving a red rag at a bull. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> senators had indicated their desire to proceed but I had not indicated agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the Labor Party’s attempt to salvage some rags of sense and honesty from the Committee stage of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that from the point of view of the Labor Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> there might have been a general bipartisan view of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> want an honest, useful and effective security organisation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the initiative of the Labor Party in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than the Attorney-General making critical comments about the motivation of the Opposition and about the contribution of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to this debate, I believe he should have looked more closely at what we are trying to do and should accept this responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, like the other parties, would like to extend our condolences to  Sir Charles’s  family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is a major breakthrough, a philosophy that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have been advocating since our formation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sympathy which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would share because, in our own small way, we have tried so far to make contact with Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously now the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are going to support not their own policies but those of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> take this opportunity to condemn the Government for its economic policies, the lack of long term planning and the ‘incredibility’- if I could use that word- of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will speak to those three points in turn and explain why the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> express condemnation of the Government’s economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned before and I mention again how disturbed the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are about the obsession this Government and the Treasury of this nation have towards the monetarists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that to cut back on expenditure at this stage is going totally and absolutely in the wrong direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For several reasons, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> choose the housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Chipp  has already said, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> approve, and in his speech today - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are concerned about the Great Barrier Reef in relation to this question of oil drilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are concerned because there are those in our community who are trying to appeal to the Australian society on several dishonest levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> commend the Government for the action it is beginning to take in this regard, particularly the action concerning the use of alcohol supplements to fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings me to my second point: Is it really worth it in cold economic terms- not aesthetically, not morally, although naturally the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support those values above all in this matter, but in sheer money terms? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Australian Conservation Foundation, supported by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, is that the entire continental shelf waters, from the Queensland coast to the outer extremities of the reef, are an intimately associated natural system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> find the Prime Minister’s assurances very welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of reassurance to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> that the Prime Minister has given the guarantee he has against the remotest possibility - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not advance the case of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> at all for its members to patronise us in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is what we all, including the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are particularly interested in the fact that certain plutonium at Maralinga is stored in salt in steel drums and covered by only a steel plate and a metre or so of soil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Chipp  is claiming that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> perhaps will win the fourth seat in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor will win three seats, the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will win the fourth and the Liberal Party will win the other one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of Government senators and members of the House of Representatives, as well as the Opposition, the independent senator and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, have spoken out against the change from six-monthly to once-a-year indexation of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are extremely keen about this move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a warning shot, house <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on Tuesday voted among themselves by almost two to one to block the president’s plan to begin lifting price controls at the end of this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, 66 Republicans supported the bill with the moderate Illinois congressman,  Mr John  Anderson, at their head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are on neither side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are inclined to support the Labor Party’s attitude in this debate and will signify that to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have the gravest doubts about the viability of the nuclear power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the foreseeable future, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> see few glimmerings of improvement on the horizon; rather, with incidents such as occurred at Harrisburg, we see more problems ahead for the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concern of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is with the policy of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> mean in this case about Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would like to see the Atomic Energy Commission transformed into an energy department so that the expert people it employs who are not specialist particles physicists can devote their efforts to other sources of energy that, although we have made some important startsand I must give the Government credit for that- we are still substantially neglecting in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not wish to go against government legislation unthinkingly or without any consideration, but we believe that the Government has got itself into a jam in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> for those reasons support the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opposition to this measure, which is apparent from the speeches of Labor senators and  Senator Mason,  who spoke on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, seems to come about because of a misunderstanding of the nature of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the view of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> the Commonwealth Government Employees (Retirement and Redeployment) Amendment Bill 1979 could have been a good Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, this Bill can be applauded because it is a beginning to certain things that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, at lest, have been saying for 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> agree basically with some of the principles in this Bill, certainly voluntary early retirement, which we think could well be extended to the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> feel a particular concern, as others do, about clause 7 (1) (b) (iii). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> oppose this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the concept of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will probably vote against the few other Labor amendments; but let me say, without scoring a point, that we in our party are in a unique position in matters such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would totally support this proposed new clause if it ended after the first sentence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are worried about the security of uranium oxide, which Australia proposes shortly to export in larger quantities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section of the agreement which worries the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is that which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> find that to be a source of concern far beyond that of the actual export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For what it is worth, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the thrust of the Bill and will support the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Chipp,  on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, has been critical in many respects as I understand what he said the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do intend to support the Government senators in giving this Bill a second reading, even though at the Committee stage there may be some opposition to some of its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will vote with the Government on this matter for the very reasons espoused by  Senator Rae  and which I stated yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> oppose the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will not have a bar of stockpiling uranium at Roxby Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe, that going to nuclear power and exporting our uranium is the ultimate insanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is that key life saving drugs should be free, but we could not support the principle involved in the Australian Labor Party amendment, that all medical prescriptions should be free, even to people who are disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I will foreshadow a submission from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> policy group in this area- a group which includes doctors and pharmacists- to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  which might suggest streamlined methods by which this major item of some $345,000 a year could be very much reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not respect those in the profession who do blatantly rip off the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will be waiting very anxiously for some sort of report from the Government on just what it is doing to control that appalling, atrocious situation, which by the way of course is leading substantially to the lowered public opinion of the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words of  Senator Peter  Baume and others on the subject of our hypocrisy and lack of positive action in such matters are very much shared by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can pledge the active support of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to any government that makes an honest effort to alter those hypocritical attitudes of government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> oppose the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would like the opportunity to second this amendment- if it were necessary to do so- because we certainly support it, very much for the valid reasons that have already been stated at some length by  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe that in a society which permits inflation- I believe I use that word ‘permits’ advisedly- the principle which maintains a parity of financial reward or compensation to all sections of the society is necessary as well as being equitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977, at the general election,  Mr Paul  Baker was the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> candidate for the seat of Paterson in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had certain literature printed for him, including a free newspaper which was headed: ‘Introducing Paul Baker, Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> Candidate for Paterson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that four page newspaper  Mr Baker  introduced himself and the policies of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, made some comments about the defeat of communism- there is an article in the newspaper entitled: ‘This is how close we are to Communism ‘-and exposed the appalling record of the Australian Labor Party when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided on the back of the newspaper was an elaborate how-to-vote chart which promoted  Mr Baker  as the candidate for the seat of Paterson and promoted the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> candidates for the Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That how-to-vote chart was headed on one side: How to vote Don Chipp and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and make your second preference Labor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other side it was headed: ‘How to vote Don Chipp and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and make your second preference LiberalNCP.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Mr Baker  declined to pay for the material which was published with his authorisation and on his behalf as a candidate and which promoted both him and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, this company, to whom a debt of $1,300 is a substantial debt, a potentially crippling debt, on 4 June 1 979 wrote to  Senator D.  L. Chipp, the Parliamentary Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, at Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It drew  Senator Chipp  ‘s attention to the fact that the company had printed two newspapers for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> candidate in Paterson,  Mr Paul  Baker, and that the amount which he owed the company was $1,375.95. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appealed to  Senator Chipp,  as Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, as to whether that party was prepared to honour the obligations entered into by a candidate who stood under the banner of that party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Mr Baker  stood as an Australian Democrat candidate in 1977, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are not liable for debts incurred by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a moral obligation on the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, as a political organisation and as a political party, to honour a debt incurred in terms of material prepared not only for the promotion of  Mr Baker  as a candidate but for the promotion of  Senator Mason,  who gathered together the 6.6 per cent of the votes that he received in the electorate of Paterson, in amassing the total of votes which brought him, as an Australian Democrat, into this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, they cannot afford to carry a debt of $ 1 ,300, which it appears that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are not prepared to honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the fact that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> as a party have not seen fit to honour a commitment or to assist my constituents to maintain a reasonable position in terms of electoral expenses incurred on their behalf, I use this occasion to make a public appeal to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to understand that this debt was incurred in terms of the election of people to this place and to see that this account is promptly and properly settled with people who are entitled to receive payments for services rendered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services whether it is a fact that certain threats from the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> were reported to the effect that following the next elections the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will challenge honourable senators taking their place in this chamber on the matter of electoral expenses if his personal requests on public funding are not met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is this approach by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> the most appropriate way of exercising a party’s voice in this chamber on the matter of public funding of political parties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates also to all members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> who are members of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will support the motion put forward by  Senator Wriedt  in this matter, but we will support it with some reluctance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would argue against that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that senators from the Labor Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> cannot find time to come into the chamber occasionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond that, I want to speak briefly about the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ concern for the whole area of conservation and the Government’s attitude to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> feel it is wrong and unfair that the attitude should be taken that these are groups of people who, for some weird reason, are concerned about the environment; that it is something they own or which is to their benefit and therefore they had better get out and raise some money to protect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> I would implore the Government to look very carefully at, firstly, altering this policy which has come in this year of dollar for dollar grants and, secondly, to improve and increase the amount of funding available for this important area and to look sympathetically at requests for relatively small $5,000 to $7,000 special purpose grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> approve of the basic sentiments expressed by the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  in this statement providedSenator Wriedt made this point- that those sentiments are supported by concrete facts; in other words, provided that the plan which emerges for the Great Barrier Reef is one which is definite and not merely, as so much of this statement is, an utterance of generalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement that the public will be extensively consulted is very welcome to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that suspicion is what has created the persistence with which certainly the Australian Labor Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> continue to attack this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been constantly abhorred by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that it was a lie was proven because the votes for a candidate for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>- a minority party- were counted and he was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the action taken by the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in Tasmania has frightened some politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the jumbo jet incident in Sydney,  Senator Mason  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> asked a question in this place on 5 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> naturally oppose this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be said very clearly- I am glad that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> take the same view and I hope that the independent senator will do likewisethat the issues are too big for us to be shovelling legislation of this nature through the Senate tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> could not possibly support this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard also the opinions of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> expressed by their leader  Senator Don  Chipp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> support the Australian Labor Party’s amendment for the obvious reason that if the Government in these days of continuing cost increases, is to provide the same facilities and assistance as it has in the past, it will have to increase any subsidy or benefit to an organisation which it wishes to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it most disappointing, and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> find it most disappointing, that in the meantime nothing has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this group of homeless young that we have to consider most of all, and that is the group that certainly concerns the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> most at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than being State employees, or going out wandering around doing up national parks on some sort of lower salary, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would rather see a contract with a group for certain work or some group of activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have no basic objection to what the Bill is doing, namely, extending indefinitely provisions of the three year program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On July 1 9th  Senator Don  Chipp, Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> had a letter published in the ‘National Farmer’ (circulation nearly 200,000). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to notify  Mr Osmond,  and am pleased to tell the National Farmer’ again, that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are totally committed to the equalisation of petrol in country areas; rationalising telephone charges, basing them on time rather than distance; reducing the sales tax on goods transported to rural areas, and introducing orderly marketing for all primary products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe it is immoral for farmers to be working for a negative wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 980, it is likely that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will gain the balance of power in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  explanation for having said that the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, whom he expects will hold the balance of power after 1980, will introduce private member’s Bills to do three things appears to be that, from the Bills that he proposes to introduce, the sections that actually appropriate the money will be omitted and therefore the Bills will not be disqualified by virtue of section 53 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he is really saying is that the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> propose to introduce meaningless Bills as some sort of a political stunt by which they hope to secure support within the country, without delivering the goods that they have promised to deliver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> welcome certain points of the Social Services Amendment Bill 1979 and would agree with the amendments put by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My views and those of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are well known on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter this debate simply to say that all that we have heard from the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  and what is in the minds of  Senator Robertson  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>  (Senator Mason)  simply justifies  Senator Webster’s  forming an alliance with the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Government appreciates the view that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have expressed and understands that those honourable senators will vote with it on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> say that the whole situation is a national disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have great pleasure in congratulating the Committee, especially its  Chairman, Senator Missen,  on the achievement of this report and the work it has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> this question of exemptions naturally is very close to our hearts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copies of the original interim report have been made available on a confidential basis to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  and to the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>  (Senator Chipp). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would not oppose this move if the integrity, the autonomy and the cohesiveness of the Federal Narcotics Bureau could be moved into the Australian Federal Police as a unit, with all its intelligence, its training and its back-up, and kept as a unit under the control of this magnificent man,  Sir Colin  Woods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the German Social Democratic Party, the fraternal party of my own Party, the Australian Labor Party, is illegal in East Germany, despite the fact that the parties which correspond to any of the other parties in Australia, whether the Liberal Party, the National Country Party or the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, are illegal within East Germany and are unable to function within East Germany and despite the fact that in West Germany all of the political parties are legal apart from those which actually advocate the policies of the former National Socialist Party, I do not believe that there is any doubt that many people throughout the world believe that somehow or other East Germany is more democratic than West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not spend a lot of time discussing the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ objections to this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I did want to make is that we in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> since we have been in this place- I think I can speak for  Senator Chipp  as well as myself when I say that we are perfectly qualified, perhaps by past experience, to pad out our speeches to our full speaking time- have made an attempt in most cases to use only a little of the speaking time allowed and just to say what we have to say and no more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mason  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> said earlier that many people outside the Parliament were worried about a notice of motion that he has on the Notice Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this struggle, I have always felt that we lacked a clearly defined charter which set out unambiguously the rights which we <span class="highlight">democrats</span> guarantee to our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will be reluctantly supporting the Government in respect of this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the view of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> on the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> concur with almost everything those honourable senators said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are very disappointed with the Human Rights Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the adopted policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is for the introduction of a Bill of rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> join  Senator Missen  in rejecting the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill unless it is substantially altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the merit of  Senator Missen  ‘s proposal, which is in similar terms to the proposal put forward by the Labor Party and endorsed by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, is that it may, along with the similar clauses in the Racial Discrimination Act and the proposed similar clause in former  Senator Murphy’s  Bill on Human rights, build up a practice whereby this Parliament is involved in the process of telling the international community that we will be bound in some particular manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I say that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> will be supporting the Government on this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is that the Minister has not done either of these things and, with great respect to Opposition members, they have not produced evidence that she has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, again with respect to  Senator Grimes  and  Senator Gietzelt,  the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not believe that the Opposition has sustained that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I will just reiterate that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, for the reasons I have stated, find absolutely no evidence produced by the Australian Labor Party that  Senator the Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> also support the proposed amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> are delighted with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> applaud the moderation of this view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> suggest that these matters have to be resolved in one way or another before we go into this sort of dangerous technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> view on nuclear energy is well enough known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> look forward to reading this report in detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> basically but conditionally support this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For reasons which I will deal with in the Committee stage- I will not take up time with them now- the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not propose to support the Australian Labor Party’s amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I said that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ support of this Bill is conditional, I meant that it is conditional on the understanding, which we believe we can reasonably assume, that neither the Minister nor the Government intends to bring forward further amendments in the near future to this Bill which might in any way limit the powers of the Northern Land Council to exercise a proper right of veto or otherwise over the question of the proceeding of Pancontinental Mining Ltd at Jabiluka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would like to put in on this subject a few words not unlike some of the comments that  Senator Evans  has made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> feel that it is quite unnecessary to have this extravagant Taj Mahal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would suggest that this is very much an argument against clause 17, to which we thoroughly object in almost every particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have made two points which we feel are relevant and to the point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- Certain news reports this morning have stated that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> failed to vote on a clause of the Human Rights Commission Bill last evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I apologise to the Senate, but would respectfully ask that in future the Government might pay the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and the Australian Labor Party the courtesy of informing us if the rules and times of sitting are to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) 1979-80 is that we of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> do not want this session to end without a reiteration of our view on unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have some positive suggestions to make on ways to overcome this which particularly concerns the appropriation of public revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Definite proposals which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would put forward- hard, practical and pragmatic proposals which could be carried out tomorrow and should have been implemented a month or a year ago because they are being carried out overseas- are these: Removal of sales tax, which of course has happened, on solar heating devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> want something practical done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be organised and got together by the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> if the Liberal-National Country Party is too lazy to doit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That too makes a point that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> believe we have a duty to do that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> say that it would be possible for us to get to M 15 within two to three years if we started now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would see those disincentives as involving high annual taxation on such vehicles, on a sliding scale, in addition to a fairly hot supertax at the time of first sale, so that if one wants to have a car like that one will have to pay through the nose for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> suggest also in this package that there should be a major public relations and advertising campaign based on the Life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the philosphy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are degrees even of Leftism; there are Trotskyites, other types of left, social <span class="highlight">democrats</span>- a whole gamut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter arises as a result of an article by Tony O’Leary in yesterday evening’s Sydney  Sun  which quotes  Senator Peter  Baume as referring to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> rather quaintly as a ‘damp squib’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> towards the Bill changed when several Liberal senators made a statement last weekend to the effect that they had withdrawn their significant and important amendments and that these amendments, which we would have supported, were no longer achievable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this outcry does come about when a <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> senator is absent for only a few hours even as a result of illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> number only two of the 64 senators in this place, at one stage - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there will be a second opportunity for members of the Liberal Party, for members of the Country Party and for members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, who voted with the Government in the vote which has just taken place and abdicated not only all responsibility to review actions of the Government but also abdicated the right to know the facts upon which they could base such a review of actions of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An opportunity will recur tomorrow for all members of the Liberal Party, all members of the Country Party and all members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to decide whether this so-called House of review will assert its right to know what are the facts in order that it may, should it choose to do so, review them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the main points that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> wish to make and we commend them to the Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is not unlike the view expressed by  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be very much in accord with the policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> if it did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is part of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>’ policy on education, and we would like to see the Government consider a tiny amendment which would include within the objectives of the Institute some relevance to education, and particularly the kind of education which would be recognised in this Bill as having multicultural backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that and having fought this long battle and lost ignominiously, I pledge the support of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> to the Australian Federal Police in their war against organised crime in this country and I wish them good luck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- I thank the Opposition and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> for their speedy consideration of what is, as they have conceded, essentially a technical Bill which simply tidies up the legislation which refers to the Commonwealth Police, changes the references to the Australian Federal Police and deals with some basically industrial matters about which there is no dispute within the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Needless to say, the Australian Federal Police represents the amalgamation of the previous forces and it is the job of the new force to improve Federal policing in Australia in a way in which I believe the Government, the Opposition and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would all wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></li>
