<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman knows that no Minister has any responsibility for any statement made by the leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is a matter for regret that sitting on that side of Parliament are men who call themselves <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem with people getting up and posing as great <span class="highlight">democrats</span> is that they are very rarely consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Playing cricket and rugby does not make people <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the present regime has outlawed the Communist Party, the Pan African Congress, the African National Congress and the Congress of <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and has caused the total disintegration of the Liberal Party, openly Fascist and antiSemitic organisations and individuals are allowed to continue with their activities unchecked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I hope the honourable member will rise again some time and speak on these matters because, like all <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, I do not want to see Fascism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you ever feel that you are <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and support the League of Rights, get hold of some of Eric Butler’s earlier contributions to Australian literature and read works such as ‘Voices of Hate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vietnam is a controversial issue, and it is a controversial issue among <span class="highlight">democrats</span>: among those who value and seek to maintain an ‘open’ and pluralist society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vietnam is u controversial issue, and it is a controversial issue among <span class="highlight">democrats</span>; among those who value and seek to maintain an ‘open’ and pluralist society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing that happened was the formation of the Christian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> which was fundamentally a Catholic party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why honourable members on this side of the House, as true <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, support the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the 1940 takeover of China by the Chinese Communists, he argued that the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> had lost China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are one of the few <span class="highlight">democrats</span> remaining in the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He used repressive laws to outlaw the Communist Party and then used the same repressive laws to destroy all other political parties, including the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States we find Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in both the Senate and the House of Representatives speaking out against this vile, immoral war in Vietnam, this inhuman, bottomless pit of human suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we have read reports from America on this system of committee use so far as their parliamentary government is concerned and many of us know that <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and Republicans vote on the same side of the House on given problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wc pride ourselves in Australia on being <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and on being the protectors and maintainers of democracy, yet I. would venture to say that we keep alive in this country a mere shadow of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Glynn  finished with this fine phrase - and I read it for the benefit of the Minister, the members of the Country Party and those Liberals who call themselves <span class="highlight">democrats</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its objective is to give to the Australian people truly representative government - and to give practical expression to the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln - which still echo down through the ages - and linger in the minds of all true <span class="highlight">democrats</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one of them has ever shown concern about our involvement in Vietnam - unlike the position in the United States of America, where both <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and Republicans are totally opposed to the war and where there is now a majority in the Senate opposed to America’s participation in this conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that in the United States of America Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> alike have opposed the war in Vietnam and have criticised it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliamentarians from both sides of the fence, Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> alike, have condemned the barbarism and the action of the United States Government, whether it be a Democrat or Republican administration, in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have honourable members opposite been so monolithic in their support when in the United States both Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> alike have opposed their Government’s policy, whether it be Democratic policy or Republican policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no disagreement between any of the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> in the United States and  President  Nixon on his proposed visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that Government supporters at least would examine their guilt, as members of Congress in the United States, both Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 cannot see why we did not have the one support price because it costs the same amount to grow a bushel of apples whether they are jonathans sturmers or <span class="highlight">democrats</span> or any other variety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 220 cartons of <span class="highlight">democrats</span> that were sent on the Rockhampton Star* to Rotterdam and Florence there was a return of 2,365 Danish florins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was for 220 cartons of <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next example that I give concerns a shipment of 373 cells of <span class="highlight">democrats</span> on the vessel ‘Greenland’ to Hamburg. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition are known as great <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States of America - I could talk about some Americans with great pride - Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> alike have had the courage to stand up against the war in Vietnam and against their own Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Republicans and <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> alike have criticised their Government for the crimes that have been committed in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the guise of <span class="highlight">democrats</span> it has destroyed every vestige of democractic representation in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the case put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in the debate on previous Bills and today is one that is unanswerable in the minds of all <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  expressed the phobia of honourable members opposite when he talked about the world being made up of communists and others, and he said that the ‘others’ were the <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet during that period of time the United States Senate - both the Republicans and the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> - voted by an overwhelming majority that the policies of the United States Government in Vietnam were wrong and that their troops should be withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite are the <span class="highlight">democrats</span> who talk about us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing that he is one of the few <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in the Liberal Party I hope he will vote with us on this motion because his electorate contains, amongst other things, a lot of people with savings - plenty of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member suggesting the reforms is one of those great <span class="highlight">democrats</span> who got 10 per cent of the Australian votes at the last couple of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently when the Labor Party, as the Government, introduces a reform for which most honourable members have clamoured - we know that the vast majority of <span class="highlight">democrats</span> wants representation for the Territories - we find it opposed by members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is like others on that side of the House; they are great <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in opposition but they were jackbooters in every sense of the word when they sat on the government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> when they are in opposition and jackbooters when they are in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not good to know that in the distant future when honourable members opposite may get to this side of the Parliament again at least we will have made them <span class="highlight">democrats</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We got home early on that occasion after the adjournment debate finished at 12.57 a.m. For the next 3 or 4 months the <span class="highlight">democrats</span> who now sit opposite disappeared into the wilderness and did not bother bringing the Parliament together in that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in Australia that prospect is frightening to the extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we have those people opposite who call themselves <span class="highlight">democrats</span> telling the Australian people that they do not even trust them to vote on the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are a notable bunch of <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather amusing that the great <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in the Government in Queensland stated - according to the ‘Courier Mail’ of 24 November - that they were angered because the announcement of proposed price increases was made prior to 8 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says: ‘We are <span class="highlight">democrats</span>’, ‘Let the people decide.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposals are rejected they will still have had the opportunity - something which the so-called <span class="highlight">democrats</span> opposite denied them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <span class="highlight">democrats</span> opposite object to that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is something that will meet with the approval of all <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in this country because legislation should not be allowed to be defeated merely by something that has not occurred before in the history of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that inspires me to see that Parliament gets a good go is not the Opposition but because on this side we are <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the great <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in the Country Party again want to deny to the people the right to express an opinion on that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen members of a party move through country areas telling country people for decades how disadvantaged they are and at the same time, in a parallel fashion and as a result, they have drawn that countryside down to a position where it has been ridiculed by <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian people truly representative government and to give practical expression to the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln, which still echo down through the ages and linger in the minds of all <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, namely: ‘Government of the people, by the people, for the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no obstructionism from the Senate if we are <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and recognise that the voice of the people can be expressed in 2 chambers each elected on a democratic basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here we have the Prime Minister claiming to have achieved an historic occasion, a Joint Sitting of both Houses, whereas the maudlin fact is that the Joint Sitting is necessary only because his electoral result left him in such doubt as to his differences with the Senate that it is necessary for us to come together and, as great <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, submit the life of the Senate to this miserable majority of three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not do so until it gained the seat for the Northern Territory, and then Opposition supporters suddenly became great <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members read the article to which I have referred they would be surprised to learn just how similar are the problems and the solutions offered by the conservatives on their side and by the social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> on this side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parliamentarians and <span class="highlight">democrats</span> have always been faced with the problem of the power that any government can give to a statutory corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because honourable members opposite are not <span class="highlight">democrats</span> that they do not want this kind of reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he were controlled by the ALP trade unions I would not mind it as much as his being controlled by the ones who do in fact control him because at least the ALP trade unions are <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the Parliament believe, as do all <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, that the value of a man’s vote should not depend on where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These social <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, these so-called protectors of the weak and poor, brought the highest unemployment to Australia since the great depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way as this Government has passed over any formal indication of concern for the dismantling of democracy over which it presided last year, it is now overlooking and disregarding issues which my colleagues and I have raised as <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and as people very concerned about proper representation in this House and responsiveness to this representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not expect them to take up, as <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, the suggestions in the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no one among the ranks of the 3 opposition parties- Progressive Conservatives, the New <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and the Social Credit Party- disputed his claim it was perhaps because members of all the parties in the House of Commons in Canada finally had a finger in the outcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Sweden there is no preference for any political party, although the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have been in power for more than 35 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation enacted by the Swedish Parliament gave no special benefits to the Social <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gave as an example the failure of the Gaullists in France, the success of the socialists and communists in local government elections in that country, and the failure of the social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in State elections in Western Germany, and the fear of the communists being elected to Government in Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me state again on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that, although we promote public enterprise, like other social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and democratic socialists everywhere in the world we see this promotion in the context of a mixed economy of private as well as public enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian Labor Party, in common with all social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> or democratic socialistsindeed, in common with many conservatives, too, in other parts of the world- reject that concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out in my speech the week before last, although there was some doubt as to who would become the United States  President,  there was no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> would keep control of both Houses of the Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that no honourable member opposite could hold his head up at a meeting of true <span class="highlight">democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">democrats</span> we had accepted that because, though one may argue about the electoral system, we respected the will of the people and we believed that in time the will of the people would give us the chance we sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we start to bring that practice into government- it is a very dangerous practice- we will have a situation such as the one that exists in the United States of America whereby when a new government takes over it brings in all its <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, Republicans and so on, and the reverse happens when the other party wins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one argued by social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> throughout the 1950s and the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to touch on some of these matters and continue to fight on behalf of all those people in Australia who consider themselves <span class="highlight">democrats</span>, no matter what party to which they belong, for electoral justice in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in this House- I think there are one or two on the other side as well- should be prepared to stand up for the basic democratic principle of freedom of association which is under attack by this left wing group of academics and their associates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some executives of the Cattlemen’s Union have resorted to threat and have attempted to blackmail members of Parliament by attacking them personally as not doing their jobs and by threatening to join Australia s latest and most formless political party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, in an attempt to take away our seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not seem to me that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> present any such viable alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would judge that most of those who have hitherto leaned towards the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> have done so in desperation, not supporting them in reality, but simply because there was no other way of expressing their dissatisfaction with both the main Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to know also, and I think the people of Australia are entitled to know, where the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> stand on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to join the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> but obviously a lot of people in the Liberal Party have joined the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>, as one can see from the polls that have taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a lot of those honourable members opposite who will lose their seats could well end up in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the issues on which the election will be fought are of significance to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> as well as to the Liberal and National Country Parties and to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons, of course, that an election has been called for the House of Representatives and half the Senate is that an attempt is being made to silence the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have already seen in New South Wales a desperate attempt by the Labor Party to destroy the small parties in that State, in particular the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was also a candidate from the Progress Party and another candidate from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It polled an almost similar number of votes as the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not really understand this situation let us look at some of the countries where the so-called social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> have taken over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If changes in the pattern of work lead to people being compulsorily retired at 55 or unemployable at 25, we should not be surprised if they turn to liquor, drugs, day-time television, the occult, introspection, boredom, emotional paralysis or the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Leader of the House that this year he ought to take the opportunity to write his way into the history books of this country and into the affection of all <span class="highlight">democrats</span> by doing something about parliamentary reform and giving back bench members, the private members, more opportunity to bring matters before this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House in his other capacity as Minister for Primary Industry may not be too popular with the farmers at the moment but at least he could be popular with the <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in this country if he got on with the job of ensuring parliamentary reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compliment the Minister for the Capital Territory on being flexible enough to see that there was a groundswell of opinion in both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party locally and also in the parties that are not represented in this Parliament by people from the Australian Capital Territory- the National Country Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>- to have the referendum held before Christmas and the election next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties running those countries adopt fictitious and high sounding names such as <span class="highlight">democrats</span> and socialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of democratic socialists or social <span class="highlight">democrats</span>- honourable members can refer to me in either of those terms- is to make our society freer, fairer and more enterprising and to recognise that enterprise does not have to be solely in the private sector any more than it should be solely in the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How the Liberal Party chooses its office bearers is a matter for it, but it must be a matter of deep concern to every democrat in the Liberal Party- there are some- and certainly to all <span class="highlight">democrats</span> in Australia when, bearing in mind the allegations against  Mr Urbanchich, Mr Urbanchich  stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We social <span class="highlight">democrats</span> or democratic socialists- in other words, we members of the Labor Party- believe that people do best if they operate in a mixed economy, that is, a private business sector operating in partnership with a government sector, in which the operation of market forces is controlled by the government either through legal rules or through direct intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we know that the current Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> is Leader of the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> and there is an effective, viable minority party in the form of a democratic party, because of the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the way that the former Minister,  Senator Chipp,  left the Government coalition parties as a protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody has found the magic answer that the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand have found- not the American Administration, be it the <span class="highlight">Democrats</span> or the alternative, the British Administration or any of the Western European administrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
