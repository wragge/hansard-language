<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As the General Assembly of the United Nations has designated 1971 as the International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination will the Government make an early statement on whether it will actively support this decision, which would be in line with Australia’s subscription to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to the adoption by the Third Committee of the United Nations of a resolution that Zionism is a form of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pretoria used the excuse thai he made political statements criticising <span class="highlight">racism</span>, lt is true that, as a Negro and a sportsman, Ashe has in the past said he thought it wrong that black athletes should be excluded from South Africa because of their color. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no room for <span class="highlight">racism</span> of this sort in international sport, which ideally provides a way for men to meet and test each other on their merits, without the intrusion of politics or racial inequality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that by doing so we encourage <span class="highlight">racism</span> inside South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recollect distinctly that  Senator Murphy  accused the Government of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>land tenure, unemployment, <span class="highlight">racism</span>, unenlightened urban planning, inequality of opportunity and reward . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can never understand what  Senator Keeffe  is saying, but I, think I heard him correctly because he is always accusingpeople of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and throwing, around allegations of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the question in view of the remarks made at today’s luncheon and also in view of the recent statement made by the Prime Minister that he and his Government abhor <span class="highlight">racism</span> and that the Government is giving $12,000 to a national committee being established to combat <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As much as I disagree, with those laws-and I take every opportunity to express my personal antipathy towards <span class="highlight">racism</span> in any shape or form- I say that any man who will run in front of a young girl who is unprotected in a- strange country which she is visiting for the purpose of playing in a competitive sport, and any man who would adopt a threatening attitude to such a girl and say to her that she was not to play because her government has a policy with which he disagrees, is not a man; he is a mongrel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That girl may be as conscientiously opposed as I am to <span class="highlight">racism</span> in all its shapes and forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have just described is what happens when such people seek to interfere in a tennis match because some young ladies playing in the tournament represent a country that has a policy of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a strange thing that these people do not interfere to the same degree with the Moscow Circus because of the <span class="highlight">racism</span> that exists in Russia.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the churches have to exhibit a much greater responsibility in relation to <span class="highlight">racism</span> than they have exhibited so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she is not such  a  person and if she is not an assisted migrant her deportation could be only on the grounds of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Executive of the Federal Council for Advancement of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders invites the General Assembly of the United Nations to appoint a delegation to visit Australia and examine the incidence and the charges of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination in many forms practised against the indigenous peoples of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has  Mr Ian  Spalding prepared for the Federal Government a report on instances of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in text books dealing with Aboriginal Affairs; if so, is it intended that the report shall (a) remain a secret document, (b) bc available on request, or (c) be presented to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ill will attaches to Australia throughout Asia because we are branded as a bastion of <span class="highlight">racism</span> for allowing the Springboks into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gair  who takes issue with me on this question of <span class="highlight">racism</span> interjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has  Mr Ian  Spalding prepared for the Federal Government a report on instances of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in textbacks dealing with Aboriginal Affairs; if so, it is intendedthat the report shall (a) remain a secret document, (b) be available on request, or (c)be presented to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report does not deal with ‘instances of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in text books’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There poverty, <span class="highlight">racism</span>, congestion, war, crime and a rising incidence of dissent
          are shaking the very foundations of that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was 1971 declared by the United Nations Organisation as the international year for action to combat <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action to combat <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination has been taken or is intended to be taken during 1971 by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s reply to  Senator Mulvihill  that assisted passage is granted only to Europeans and is unrelated to the skills required in Australia, is this not evidence of a policy of <span class="highlight">racism</span> of the worst kind in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to the Hitler type tactics of the Australian National Socialist Party, also known as the Australian Nazi Party, at an Australian Council of Churches conference on <span class="highlight">racism</span> held on the Gold Coast last weekend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>There is more <span class="highlight">racism</span> in some of those countries than there is in Australia and similar countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whichever way we look at this, it is <span class="highlight">racism</span> and it is discrimination because of colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">racism</span> for which we condemn the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the moment we try to amend something, to take the <span class="highlight">racism</span> out of our policy or to make any suggestion that this great white god of immigration can be touched, it is claimed that we will let down the floodgates, or that we will let all sorts of people enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that there ever was this <span class="highlight">racism</span> in the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that it is part of Labor’s policy to sponsor <span class="highlight">racism</span> in reverse in Queensland and other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the state of Aboriginal rights, health, infant mortality, life expectancy, education, training, employment, ownership, movement and democratic political advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples everywhere in Australia is unequal compared with people of European origin, whether migrating to or bom in Australia; and this constitutes a challenge to the Australian people on grounds of racial discrimination, <span class="highlight">racism</span> and even forms of genocide; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to recent events one could say that many crimes are being committed in the name of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the Minister consider that this is <span class="highlight">racism</span> of the worst order? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he tell me what has happened to the great body of knockers of Australia who are always accusing Australia of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, when this terrible display of <span class="highlight">racism</span> is being demonstrated in Uganda? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard  Senator Wood’s  question as a very thoughtful one which throws into relief the difference between political ideologies for party political purposes and genuine beliefs for the purpose of opposing <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this present Government genuinely opposed to all forms of <span class="highlight">racism</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the first portion of the honourable senator’s question is concerned, namely whether this Government is genuinely opposed to all forms of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, I give  a  very strong affirmative answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our thinking is towards a more independent Australian stance in international affairs and towards an Australia which will be less militarily oriented and ‘ not open to suggestions of <span class="highlight">racism</span>; an Australia which will enjoy a growing standing as a distinctive,, tolerant, cooperative and well ‘ regarded nation ‘hot only in the Asian and Pacific region but in the world at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree that the original ordinance was introduced in a spirit of opposition to the Aborigines, of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, or whatever other fancy terms are used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did it to explain our new attitudes - the fact that we were going to throw <span class="highlight">racism</span> off our shoulders at long last - and to make contact with these people before they met  Mr Whitlam  at Ottawa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy had a lot to say about <span class="highlight">racism</span>, the treatment of the black people in Rhodesia and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange and indicates a strange mentality that when <span class="highlight">racism</span> is mentioned by some people, white people always have to be involved in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are involved at all it is a clear demonstration of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a word about the fact that <span class="highlight">racism</span> has been practised by most African states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This same <span class="highlight">racism</span> has been practised in these African states almost to the extent of genocide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is the peculiar attitude of mind of some people- I think that  Sir Robert  Menzies referred to this-that in some way white people must be involved before <span class="highlight">racism</span> can be described as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, the General Assembly of the United Nations approved a program for the observance of 1 97 1 as the International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vigorous action initiated by the United Nations in 1971 was followed up in November 1972 by a resolution of the General Assembly in which it was decided to launch a Decade for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination and to inaugurate these activities on 10 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initiative was taken in 1971 by the United Nations Association of Australia which set up a Committee to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee and its constituent member organisations conducted an extensive program, including the holding of seminars, the issue of pamphlets and other publications and the sponsorship with the United Nations Association of a 3 volume collection of studies, under the editorship of  Mr F.  S. Stevens entitled <span class="highlight">Racism</span>- The Australian Experience’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The volumes on Australian <span class="highlight">racism</span> disclose various aspects of discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister explain the different attitudes of this Government to <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Russia and <span class="highlight">racism</span> in South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for this Government’s attitudes on <span class="highlight">racism</span> in South Africa, they are well known and in accordance with the strong statements which have been made repeatedly in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last election honourable senators opposite- not all of them- were going to make a great deal about <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the stand we have taken, because of the stand which the previous Government took and because of the things we have said about <span class="highlight">racism</span>, we believe it is time to vote for the expulsion of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that we in this Parliament stopped having <span class="highlight">racism</span> in this country and stopped giving preference to a certain section of the community over the other Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is about time that we stopped this <span class="highlight">racism</span> and stopped giving preference to one section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the subject of discrimination in Queensland, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and another senator in this chamber have said that Queensland provides an outstanding example of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequently, the United Nations designated 1971 as the International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination, and vigorous programs for the year were conducted throughout the world, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 10 December 1973, the Decade for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination was inaugurated by the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racism</span> is an unmitigated evil . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to say and mean that we will abolish <span class="highlight">racism</span> within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the United Nations Association of Australia set up an Australian Committee to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination, as part ofthe United Nations program for the year that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically the Australian Government’s policies on a number of issues such as colonialism, <span class="highlight">racism</span>, development questions and peace zone proposals are in essential agreement with those adopted by the countries of the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is only in recent times that we have had instances in which racial disharmony and <span class="highlight">racism</span> have been highlighted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the instances have been created by persons who claim there is a <span class="highlight">racism</span> which I believe does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they were in Opposition I can recall how they constantly, in this chamber and outside it- certainly, from my recollection, in this chamber- accused the Government of being racist because of conduct in which it was alleged to have engaged when those of us in government who were responsible for the decisions which were being taken knew that there was not a spark of <span class="highlight">racism</span> or race relations in that conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in  Senator Greenwood’s  comments one of which was that there is no <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been cases of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, despite what  Senator Greenwood  said earlier about there being no <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a bit more publicity in the ‘Canberra Times’ of 27 November last for Australia and Australians whom  Senator Greenwood  says show no <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find <span class="highlight">racism</span> the most objectionable and most obnoxious form of discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is significant that the perverse character who refused leave to  Senator Coleman  to table documents on <span class="highlight">racism</span> comes from the State that carried out a policy of genocide of its Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who thinks that words are stronger than deeds- those who deny the existence of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, those who talk about prejudice as if it does not exist, those who say this legislation ought not to be carried and those who are concerned to protect the guilty rather than the innocent victims of racial discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood has the temerity to suggest that this can be put in the same category as those philosophical propositions of communism and facism, that the question of <span class="highlight">racism</span> is part of a similar pattern and that it is in fact a philosophical position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators opposite say that they believe therefore that <span class="highlight">racism</span> did not have its origins in the superior race theories of Adolf Hitler and in some of those racist groups that operate within the United States which clearly are gaining in influence within our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at the propaganda from the Rights Committee that operates in the far north coast area of New South Wales and in Queensland to see that that organisation makes <span class="highlight">racism</span> and discrimination a cornerstone of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This material incites and fosters <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the problems are to be overcome by research and education programs such biased, emotive racially discriminatory material ought not to be tolerated if its effects are to foster <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this material does foster <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the word ‘race’, with all its added emotional connotations, has helped to create the racist myth which has in turn inspired the bizarre form of political <span class="highlight">racism</span> which the world has seen during this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very much aware of the very clear passages in the New Testament in which so-called <span class="highlight">racism</span> has no place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Words like ‘<span class="highlight">racism</span> reigns supreme in this country’ and ‘it is the major evil of the century’ and, as we heard tonight from  Senator Gietzelt,  ‘<span class="highlight">racism</span> abounds in this country’, are highly emotive words which I feel must be challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, I should like to draw attention to the far more dangerous form of <span class="highlight">racism</span> which is promoted today in the name of scientific progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So-called ‘scientific <span class="highlight">racism</span>’ is founded upon and finds its justification in evolution and polygenesis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This form of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, which is progagated in a variety of journals under different names, should be detected and effectively eliminated, in spite of the fact that it appears under the cloak of scientific respectability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I want to say that <span class="highlight">racism</span> is an expression of a particular philosophy of life by which the superiority of one human being over another is believed to be a legitimate form for a social order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe most firmly that it is not the ordinary man in the street, whatever prejudices he may foster, who is guilty of this kind of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in my opinion any racial discrimination Bill should include a reference to the immoral ideologies by which <span class="highlight">racism</span> is promoted at the expense of the dignity of humanity and all its individual members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the Australian United Nations Association set up in Australia a committee to combat <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We run into hysterics when dealing with some of these aspects, particularly in relation to <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I almost wept when I heard  Senator Gietzelt  talking about the great difficulty that some people have as a result of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been speaking of discrimination and <span class="highlight">racism</span> but let us consider where this exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To hear  Senator Gietzelt  and other honourable senators talk one would think that Australians were the worst in the world in relation to <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where do we have a deep division over <span class="highlight">racism</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as somebody who has travelled the world and who has studied recent history, I expect somebody to say that Australia is the weakest nation on earth because its inhabitants have very little <span class="highlight">racism</span> in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The pure blooded Aborigines practise <span class="highlight">racism</span> against fellows like Perkins and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The are practising a form of <span class="highlight">racism</span> against those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is able to fix <span class="highlight">racism</span> in all these countries, it is a wonderful government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People like that make us look like fools when it comes to <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would I be accused of <span class="highlight">racism</span> because I rang the police? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the seller is accused of <span class="highlight">racism</span> I understand the coloured man has to get the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do not let us get carried away with this <span class="highlight">racism</span> business to the extent that we think it is so deep that this country is divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think I owe a duty to myself, if not to my Senate colleagues, to illustrate in simple language, by 3 stories, the attitudes which I have taken, as a person, in the context of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill will polarise <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators do not believe that assertion it would be a good idea for them to obtain a copy of the report of a select committee of the House of Commons in Great Britain which has been looking at the problem of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of the report of that select committee is that the basic problem with regard to <span class="highlight">racism</span> is in the area of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must recognise the problems of the small 1’ Liberals who take a tolerant and progressive view on the question of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and other social matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate has ranged over many questions and there has been disputation about whether there is or is not <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have supported this Bill because the questions that arise continually are: Is there <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it is a fact that there are pockets of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia, not that legislation will cure it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislation will not cure <span class="highlight">racism</span> but at least it will give the opportunity for some attempt to be made to police it and to make it a breach when there is information that an action was taken which was detrimental to an individual only on the score of his race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I leave all that on one side, save to add that <span class="highlight">racism</span> became embedded in people’s cultural experience although the reasons which existed for <span class="highlight">racism</span> had long been abolished and, in some cases, forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 17 October adopted by a vote of 70 for, 29 against and 27 abstentions the draft resolution to have the General Assembly determine that Zionism is a form of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian representative on the Third Committee was instructed to oppose the draft resolution on Zionism, to make it clear in his explanation of vote that the Australian Government could not accept in any sense the determination contained in the draft resolution that Zionism is a form of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The representative said that the Australian Government believed that the attempt by the co-sponsors of the draft resolution to equate Zionism with racial discrimination was a distortion of fact, was unhelpful in the context of the search for a settlement in the Middle East and weakened the essential purposes of the 2 resolutions on the Decade for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several of us spoke in the second reading debate about the needs of people living in fringe areas of Alice Springs and I do not think there is any need to repeat them, but if Government supporters who spoke at such length about their concern to rectify the wrongs done to Aboriginal people and to make up to the Aboriginal people for the destruction of their culture and their traditional way of life meant what they said for one minute then I fail to see how they can refuse to support this amendment because it is those people, as Justice Woodward said, who have been moved away from their traditional land in camps around Alice Springs and similar places who are the worst victims of the <span class="highlight">racism</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
