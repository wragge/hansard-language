    <p>General of the United Nations of her programme and activities undertaken during this International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination (Hansard, 6th May 1971, page 2847); if so, what was the (a) date and (b) tenor of the information given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Bill that seeks to enact our firm intention to confront the evil of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we ought to realise just to what extent <span class="highlight">racism</span> exists in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am very happy to hear Opposition speakers say that they accept the fact that <span class="highlight">racism</span> reigns supreme in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a reply in Parliament by the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs (Queensland  Hansard  21 March 1979, page 359 1 ) criticising a report on <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Queensland by the Community Relations Commissioner as bias and provocative nonsense which will not alter one iota the proud record of Queensland in care for Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-59-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is covert rather than overt <span class="highlight">racism</span> for it often to pretend to be doing this by doing a little window dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for External Affairs aware that the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, instructed by the General Assembly, has addressed letters to all member states requesting them to participate in activities for 1971 which the United Nations has designated International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others are ready to hand if these issues were to pass out of the pages of history - everything from <span class="highlight">racism</span> to merino rams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to introduce <span class="highlight">racism</span> into the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most despicable part of the article, however, was the implication that all the talk about environment is really a front for old fashioned <span class="highlight">racism</span> and a desire to return to ‘Australian dreams of isolation and primitivism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen a growth in recent years of a lot of human group behavioural disorders of crime, drug taking and drug trafficking and <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet with its policy in ruins, there is no indication from the Government of any basic re-thinking of its policies and attitudes except, indeed, insofar as there are hints of a retreat to reaction, unreality and <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition loves to proclaim his hatred of <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition should define to us just what he means by <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the measure of our unconscious <span class="highlight">racism</span> that there is no revulsion when the people are yellow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing better confirms to coloured people the dormant <span class="highlight">racism</span> which they believe lies beneath the surface of many Europeans than statements such as the honourable member for Deakin made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formally proclaim 1971 to be the International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination and observe it as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to assure the honourable member that careful consideration is being given to a suitable programme to observe the year 1971 in Australia as International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this concern which led us in the United Nations General Assembly to vote in support of the resolution designating 1971 as International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the honourable member may be interested to know that the United Nations Association of Australia, along with other interested non-governmental associations has set up a National Committee to plan the effective observance of the year, named the Australian Committee to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an urgent need to study the causes of all human individual and group behavioural deviations, not only of crime in its conventional sense, but also of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, drug taking and war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr BRYANT (Wills) ,(3.34) - I want to speak briefly upon the subject which was the cause of the oration by the honourable member for Mallee..  (Mr Turnbull)  - <span class="highlight">Racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question to be faced is that of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, and how it affects people in their hearts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This issue of <span class="highlight">racism</span> has been raised as a particular question for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formally proclaim 1971 to be the International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination and observe it as such; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racism</span> is a mysterious piece of human psychology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the right honourable gentleman back up his expressions of a fortnight ago on his Government’s abhorrence of <span class="highlight">racism</span> by informing the Australian Cricket Board of Control that his Government does not approve of a visit of a cricket team from South Africa since the Government of that country has rejected a request by the South African Cricket Association that 2 non-white members be included in the team? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems significant, however, that this debate on law and order was introduced during Easter week, which commemorated the life, work and teaching of a leading dissenter, a Man who stood out against <span class="highlight">racism</span>, violence and discrimination against individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">racism</span>, according to U Thant, is the greatest single threat to world peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that we will not be able to carry out our obligations in 1971 which the United Nations General Assembly has designated as International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the (a) date and (b) tenor of the information which Australia has given to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the programmes and activities undertaken during 1971, which the 1970 General Assembly designated as International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">racism</span>, this fear, this sickness has to stop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And we must do all in our power to persuade  Mr McMahon  that Australia’s token opposition to South African <span class="highlight">racism</span> must be consistent and effective, that because of his mistake the world now sees Australia as permissively racist - and that would be the most charitable impression of us in the capitals of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how many of us here in this House have any idea of the emotions that are aroused when the subject of <span class="highlight">racism</span> is discussed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should not be done only because of the fact that they are the Aboriginal people but it should also be done for the betterment of people in the broader Australian community because there are problems of social tensions and <span class="highlight">racism</span> developing in inner city areas of all our great cities, including Brisbane, which result from bad housing for Aboriginal people and the complaints that we are getting now in increasing numbers from their neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These problems include such areas as resource recycling and substitution, population controls, better ecosys.tems management, better urban planning and design and problems within man himself such as the roots of disruptive human behaviour and <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could say that it is because quite clearly they understand the implications of <span class="highlight">racism</span> that are involved in this matter and now they are prepared to take a stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are constantly reminded in the Press, on radio and television of the horrors of war, pollution, <span class="highlight">racism</span>, alcoholism, abortion, drug abuse, conservation, the road toll, and one could go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are vitally concerned with the problems of world hunger, world illiteracy, the horrors of war, and <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to make a brief reference to the fact that in this year, the year designated by the United Nations to combat <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination, the Government has done virtually nothing through our school system to try to eliminate one of the great blights upon our society- - <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, we ought to get rid of any suggestions of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in our administration up there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is <span class="highlight">racism</span> in the administration of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is <span class="highlight">racism</span> in the payment of wages and in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the estimated cost of publicity and other assistance provided by Australian governments to combat <span class="highlight">racism</span> in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I announced in a statement on 22nd March 1971 to mark the International Year for Action to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination, the Commonwealth made a specific grant of$12,000to assist the Australian Committee to Combat <span class="highlight">Racism</span> and Racial Discrimination with its programme in connection with the Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its members gave a disgusting exhibition of <span class="highlight">racism</span> at its very worst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we cannot interfere in the internal policies of other countries, but an internal policy can become so notorious and divisive that it becomes an international issue, and when it becomes an international issue a country such as Australia must take  a  stand and sooner or later Australia will have to take more positive a stand on these divisive’ international issues of race and <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration who interjects, but who, without any conscience or without any sense of moral responsibility, has tried to inject crude <span class="highlight">racism</span> into the impending election campaign centred about immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been pointed out to me that some of those who talk most about <span class="highlight">racism</span> seem bent on creating racial conflict where none existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They operate in communities where there is much <span class="highlight">racism</span> and I pay tribute to some of my colleagues from those areas for having taken up some of these issues knowing that this will lose them votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also add that once again he has revealed his and his Government’s sympathy for toadying to and collusion with the <span class="highlight">racism</span> of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such is the taint of his sympathy for  Mr Vorster’s  <span class="highlight">racism</span> that he dared not and would not criticise it at the highest level available to him here, that is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, the resort of the Prime Minister to the Embassy for counselling and advice on what he should do with regard to Vorster’s <span class="highlight">racism</span> illustrates all too clearly that the foreign policy of Australia on this vital ma’ter was decided not by the Australian Government but by the representative of the Vorster regime in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister is the man who was so genuine in his protestations against the <span class="highlight">racism</span> of the Vorster regime that he could act only either in anticipation of a question that he knew the Opposition would fire or after it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Racism</span> and bigotry should have no part, and I feel this is something- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that it is part of Labor’s policy to sponsor <span class="highlight">racism</span> in reverse in Queensland and other States.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to give the lie, if I can, to the idea that discriminating in favour of the Aborigines in the way in which the Labor Party proposes to do it - in housing and other ways - will cause <span class="highlight">racism</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discriminating in favour of Aborigines by policies in this way is not only ensuring that problems of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in the long term are minimised but also making a great contribution towards the Australian community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has been damaged in the past by some who, for their own particular purposes, have laid against us recklessly, carelessly and without caring whether it be true or false the charge of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial prejudice, and a lot of them are on the Opposition side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are tired of a government that gets its policies from the gallup poll; that reacts to every test of leadership and statesmanship by playing on every prejudice and fear lying dormant in the community; that acts in every national or international crisis only in terms of the political advantage it can squeeze out of it - whether it be China, South Africa, Bangladesh or French nuclear tests, or whether it be poverty, industrial relations, <span class="highlight">racism</span> or rural depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I think I can say about the general matter which the honourable gentleman raised - I would like to praise him for his attitude throughout his life in this Parliament as well as outside for his many activities in this field - is that the Australian Government is resolved to press ahead by every constitutional method available to it - in particular since the 1967 referendum and under the external affairs power - to see that any traces of <span class="highlight">racism</span> in Australia’s legislation or administration are expunged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one considers the Nazi Party one has to take the view that it is hardly in the same accord or category of organisations as would be called political parties because it rests almost entirely on a principle of violence, <span class="highlight">racism</span>, anti-semitism, the repudiation of all democratic principles, the fuehrer principle and the negation of everything which the democratic principles reflect and for which this Parliament, for example, stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This could be done by making part of the curriculum an overt attempt to eliminate <span class="highlight">racism</span>- the sort of <span class="highlight">racism</span> that unfortunately is carried on from the family dinner table, from father to son and so on through the various generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will eliminate it in the textbooks of the schools and in the media by consciously making television and radio broadcasts and printing newspaper articles and so on in which the evils of <span class="highlight">racism</span> are explained to people- not just the evils of it but that it is wrong, that there is no basic difference between people of different colours, skins and religions and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether I can convince them that they are wrong but I genuinely believe that legislation used with discrimination, not used with the mailed fist, can be the framework for the next great push in Australia to eliminate <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 23 July 1975 the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Government had decided to initiate a special survey of Vietnamese refugees who had settled recently in Australia He announced that the survey would take approximately 5 years, would be conducted by  Dr Jean  Martin of the Australian National University and would encompass such things as the refugees’ reasons for leaving their own country; their social characteristics; their aspirations in their new homeland; what Australian Government assistance in maintenance and welfare they requested, or needed and received; the problems they thought they might have to face in settling in Australia and how these compared with the problems actually encountered; the problems of culture and language difference that they had to face; what happened to their cultural identity in the process of resettlement; and to what extent, if at all, they suffered from <span class="highlight">racism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But surely in the interests of racial harmony and of the acceptance of the Government’s program- it involves expenditure in excess of $3 5m- of the acceptance of the program of housing these people in the cities, it would be wise not to flutter a flag which could initiate or awaken <span class="highlight">racism</span> which may be nonexistent or dormant in the minds and hearts of white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the attention of the House to a scurrilous advertisement that appeared in the  Australian  of 29 October last, which sets out the most infamous resolution ever passed by the United Nations, whereby Zionism was said to foster the growth of <span class="highlight">racism</span> and racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first aspect is the chauvinistic nationalism which often leads to <span class="highlight">racism</span> and opposition to other countries, not on the basis of their policies but on the basis that they are Americans or Indonesians or Japanese or Russians or Chinese or Arabs or Israelis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have done it in great detail, not only in statements since I have been Minister for Foreign Affairs, but also in publications produced during 1 975 on behalf of the then Opposition indicating that the form of so-called ‘even-handedness’ pursued by the honourable gentleman’s Government, which led, ‘for example, to abstaining on questions such as deeming Zionism to be a form of <span class="highlight">racism</span>, was an even-handedness that we rejected and still do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in the mere fact that he has proposed an amendment to the Act, he also admits that differences do exist in the administration of Aboriginal communities and that of other communities and that it is the right of Aboriginals to maintain those differences so that they have some protection against intrusions, the incursions and the irresponsibilities and, indeed, the <span class="highlight">racism</span>, suppression and discrimination of which he complains in his speech on the ‘winds of change’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
