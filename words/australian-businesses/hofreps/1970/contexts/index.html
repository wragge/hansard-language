<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government of Fiji made any representations to the Australian Government concerning the activity of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> in Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was needed then was government support and incentive to encourage <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> to spend more on research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  pointed out that there has been a considerable display of enterprise by <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and exporters, but what did the Government do in those  10  years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the result of imposing a ban would be to throw Australians out of work and damage <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Robert  Jay, a reader in public accountancy at the Australian National University, said that <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> had not been taking advantage of inflation to boost prices and that a prices justification tribunal was particularly inappropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special attention will be given to encouraging individual enterprise and’ supporting smaller <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> in their struggle to compete with local and international giants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate on the Appropriation Bill is an appropriate occasion to say something about government and business in Australia as it exists under a Labor government because it is sometimes claimed that as many <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> have close associations with conservative parties and the Australian Labor Party has strong associations and affiliations with trade unions an Australian Labor government would be bad for business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden which this tax places on all <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> appears to have been completely disregarded by the Federal Government in its decisions on funding for the States and its decisions to make so many varied and substantial increases in company taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> are concerned, the Government has continued to apply the guidelines which were enunciated when the Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act was first enacted in 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no use appealing to people and saying that <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> should take over foreign owned com- panies if they could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill introduces legislation for the screening of foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and the prohibition of such takeovers determined by the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  to be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the legislation before the House represents only a partial response to the control of foreign investment in this country it will nevertheless enable the Government to examine all takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> by foreigners and to prohibit those that are considered to be contrary to the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it the Bui introduces legislation for the screening of foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and the prohibition of such takeovers as are determined by the Treasurer to be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is to limit the examinations to transactions which on rare occasions could result in a change in control of major <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> which would be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to recent cases of foreigners involved in <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> where the Government has no power under the existing Act to intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persons is defined as including foreign corporations-  control of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say ‘the private sector  I refer to the nongovernment sector of the economy, <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> small and large throughout this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These fully owned <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> each employing fewer than 100 employees are facing their worst crisis in Australian history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speculators by this time had got what they wanted- a 12 per cent gain on the exchange rates, high rates of interest on funds lent to <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and, in some cases, vast capital gains from rises in property values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for the screening of foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and the prohibition of such takeovers where they are determined to be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Royalties paid by <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> are a charge against the profits of the businesses for tax purposes and it is fair that they should bear Australian tax in the hands of the foreign recipient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Acting Treasurer any evidence to indicate to what extent the 40 per cent investment allowance has been accepted by <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau of Statistics reported a. fall of about 8 per cent in the real value of investment by <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> in the September quarter this year compared with the September quarter last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence in Australia of statutory protection for marks for services has significant consequences for <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> operating services in overseas countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> can thus be significantly disadvantaged in relation to those competitors able to obtain statutory protection for their trade marks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This significantly disadvantages certain <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> in their operation overseas until this Bill is passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975, the Government has made orders prohibiting proposed acquisitions by foreign interests of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> on four occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no better sign of confidence in the future than the willingness of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>, large and small, to take risks because the ultimate barometer of confidence in the business sector is the willingness of people to take risks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is not to promote booming unemployment in order to have booming profitability in <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
