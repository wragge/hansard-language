<ul>
  <li>
    <p>That figure would be drastically reduced to the point where many <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> would become uneconomic and would be forced to leave the industry with the resultant unemployment of the several thousand people who are now occupied in this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> in general have found a very sound economic climate in which to work in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it can impose an investment tax on overseas competitors of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special attention will be given to encouraging individual enterprise and supporting smaller <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> in their struggle to compete with local and international giants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill introduces legislation for the screening of foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and the prohibition of such takeovers determined by the Treasurer to be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appeared in the  Australian Financial Review  of 15 February 1975 and was the fourth in a series of articles by Trevor Sykes on the ownership of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the legislation one sees that it really is designed for the screening of foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and the prohibition of such takeovers when the Treasurer determines that it would be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also sounds a warning to foreign investors that no amount of money will buy control- I emphasise the word control’- of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and commercial ventures if it is against the national interest to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>^Senator Everett was somewhat critical of the attitude of the Opposition parties in earlier years to the takeover of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> by foreign companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put it to the Senate in this way: If it were possible for the unemployment situation faced by Labor at this time to be solved by a number of foreign corporations taking over flagging <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and assuring that within a year 200 000 jobs could be found, what would be the choice of Labor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill introduces legislation for the screening of foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> and the prohibition of such takeovers determined by the Treasurer to be against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has indulged in the practice of taking money from those in the community who are least able to afford it in order to feather the financial nests of the multi-national mining groups, the <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> which are mismanaged or suffering from poor management and the wealthy graziers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned to ensure that the cost to <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> of servicing the requirements of regulatory agencies should be reduced as much as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Royalties paid by <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> are a charge against the profits of the businesses for tax purposes and it is fair that they should bear Australian tax in the hands of the foreign recipient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government destroyed the structure on which <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> depended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Division is responsible for providing advice on matters relating to foreign ownership and control of Australia’s resources and industries including foreign investment proposals and foreign takeovers of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true, for example, that statistics will no longer be collected in the important areas of foreign investment and ownership of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around about that time- I think it was about the time of the 25 th anniversary in Parliament of the Premier of South Australia- he was reported as having said that we were going to move forward to become the centre of head offices for all <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>; that business executives and people who run business organisations throughout Australia would want to come and live in South Australia, particularly in Adelaide, because of its magnificent climate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence in Australia of statutory protection for marks for services has significant consequences for <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> operating services in overseas countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that over a period the Commonwealth and the States have been aware that, because of an oversupply of a number of minerals, overseas buyers have been dividing and conquering; that, indeed, a number of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> have sought to overcome being picked off one by one.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister accept that because Australian banks are in a monopoly situation they have been able to adopt lending policies which are so conservative that they are hindering the development of <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article gives another reason why South <span class="highlight">Australian businesses</span> have spent over $ 100,000 on an anti-Labor campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
