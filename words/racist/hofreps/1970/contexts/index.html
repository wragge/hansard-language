<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  in the course of his speech referred to me as a <span class="highlight">racist</span> because I had criticised the Australian Labor Party’s attempts to get money out of the Arabs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me assure him that my reference had no <span class="highlight">racist</span> connotation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how were they recruited, and is it the policy of the Government to employ policemen from a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country with the object of keeping ‘the natives’ in check? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard the honourable member refer to one newly elected Minister as a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But does the honourable member for Hunter, the member for safari suits, who called me a <span class="highlight">racist</span> but who went there as a guest of the  Speaker  of the South African Parliament <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple, blunt truth is that the Minister and his Government, and particularly its leaders, rubbish negotiations - whether they are ‘one-sided’ proposals from the Pathet Lao or, to quote the Prime Minister, these things called peace talks in Paris’ - because of an attitude of mind which represents a hankering for vanished supremacies, a nostalgia of a distinctly <span class="highlight">racist</span> cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision by the Secretary of State,  Mr Rogers,  to close down the American consulate in Salisbury reflects the strength of feeling among America’s 25 million negroes on this issue and on any issue involving the <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies of South Africa and Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his first speech as Minister, the honourable gentleman could not forbear to obtrude a reference to the new member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen),  who has dared to expose <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies and attitudes by certain Australians in Australia towards Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not attributing <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitudes so much to the Leader of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through our consistent support we have become identified as a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What disturbs me, however, is that it has never repudiated publicly those members within its own ranks who go past the Government’s official1 stance and actively campaign both at home and abroad for a closer relationship and who champion the cause of these regimes in every public or private forum available and who tend to confirm the view that Australia is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They added to their <span class="highlight">racist</span> doctrine, virulent anti-Semitism and formed an unholy alliance with Boerenasie - the Greyshirts an organisation that imitated in style and content the Blackshirts and Brownshirts of Nazi Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not on this occasion allow the discussion to be side-tracked on the <span class="highlight">racist</span> questions and other things of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, why does the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  accuse the Minister for the Navy  (Mr Killen)  and me of being <span class="highlight">racist</span> because wc go to see what is happening in South Africa, but say nothing about he honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  and a Labor Party senator visiting South <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard him called a <span class="highlight">racist</span> but I think it should be said - and, indeed, it was understood by all who were debating with him - that no man had more friends in Asia, South East Asia and Africa than he. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700818_reps_27_hor69/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr less)  has said, he was not a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700818_reps_27_hor69/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply to have visited South Africa or Rhodesia is sufficient to be labelled <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Jacob  Malik, a name not unknown to honourable members opposite, brands these <span class="highlight">racist</span> Fascist regimes as a threat to world peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all of this makes me a <span class="highlight">racist</span>, I am afraid you will have to class me as a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is talking like a Communist front, then I atn a Communist and the honourable member for Boothby can similarly be judged to be a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, it means that our policies and attitudes must be free of any <span class="highlight">racist</span> taint in alliances, sports and passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible to have fruitful relations with the Commonwealth of Nations - including Malaysia, Singapore and India and all those on the islands and shores of the Indian Ocean - if we persist in a nostalgic hankering for military collaboration with the <span class="highlight">racist</span> regimes of Southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s initiatives produced the Suez affair in 1956, an automatic Australian reflex action in defence of imaginary jugular veins, lifelines and vital routes without which our economy would be gravely damaged, demonstrating how deep in the thinking of the older Australian generation are imperialist and <span class="highlight">racist</span> assumptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of Ghana would regard such action by the British Government as a <span class="highlight">racist</span> alignment with South Africa and an  unfortunate  disregard for the susceptibilities of so many African States in Africa whose goodwill and friendship towards Britain have sustained the British presence in Africa over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the short term advantages the British Government might hope to derive from the resumption of sale of arms to South Africa or from any such conciliatory posture in its dealings with the present <span class="highlight">racist</span> regimes in Southern Africa  could  nol be compared with the long-term benefits which the British people might gain in their relations wilh so many other African States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his speech the honourable member inadvertently let slip his <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitudes of superiority when he stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do our neighbours whom we seek to impress at every opportunity think when they see how closely so many members on the Government side of the House feel for the <span class="highlight">racist</span> regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the nub of Britain’s desire to ingratiate itself with the South African <span class="highlight">racist</span> regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand we have the Aboriginal people who have been deprived for years; not on <span class="highlight">racist</span> grounds, generally speaking, but in fact they have been deprived and so it looks like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a demonstration was held in front of an Australian legation or consulate overseas and it was claimed that we were <span class="highlight">racist</span> or that we followed policies similar to South Africa, not only would we consider such statements wrong, we would also consider them offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth of the matter,  Mr Speaker,  is that this Government is so concerned with the dissent within its ranks, is so embarrassed by its close association with the Fascist policies of the <span class="highlight">racist</span> governments of southern Africa, so confused by the shambles of its administration - as manifested in the Fill fiasco, the plight of our pensioners and the depression of rural Australia - and so terrified at the prospect of running out of Communists that it has become paranoically pre-occupied with its own survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if they want the same privilege to protest against the treatment of Aboriginals or Vietnam or <span class="highlight">racist</span> sporting policies there is no way in which they can do so peaceably without exposure to penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation is unlikely to continue with controversial tours by sporting teams selected on a <span class="highlight">racist</span> basis about to visit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that Australia’s national reputation has been damaged because many of its policies are interpreted as <span class="highlight">racist</span> - I refer to those on immigration, Aboriginals and New Guinea, just to name a few - but primarily we believe that it is wrong to play sport against a team which deliberately excludes players of a different colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On three occasions recently Fred Daly, whom you have appointed as shadow Minister for Immigration, has given a <span class="highlight">racist</span> interpretation of Federal ALP policy on immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you intend to nominate him for this position …. in 1972 or would he become Interior and you will have a person in this position who will interpret it in a non-<span class="highlight">racist</span> manner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say at this stage that I have been grievously misrepresented and in the eyes of the Australian people I have been placed in a very unfortunate position, having been classified as <span class="highlight">racist</span> in character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In supporting the motion I want to make it quite plain that it is not my belief that my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> in any sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the United Nations Special Committee on Apartheid decide to appeal for the release of Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe who was detained by South African authorities for 9 years after inciting his fellow South Africans to defy unjust <span class="highlight">racist</span> laws and to demonstrate peacefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sincerely hope that the people of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Japan are sophisticated enough to distinguish between our Government’s real reasons and its public relations reasons; that the coloured people who are much more important to our future than all the Afrikaaner in South Africa can detect the difference between racists and political opportunists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And we must do all in our power to persuade  Mr McMahon  that Australia’s token opposition to South African racism must be consistent and effective, that because of his mistake the world now sees Australia as permissively <span class="highlight">racist</span> - and that would be the most charitable impression of us in the capitals of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will use the games team from the greatest of all <span class="highlight">racist</span> nations to create a false situation for his own ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this is a great problem as far as many Australians are concerned, though no Australian ever admits to being <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think Australians are <span class="highlight">racist</span>, but they are frightened their next door neighbours might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which needs to be emphasised and repeated again and again, until people from all oyer the world will realise that Australia’s immigration policy is not a <span class="highlight">racist</span> one bat, like those of most other countries, is a selective one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants an election fought on <span class="highlight">racist</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will come to its senses, because the last thing I would like to see in this country is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communist Party of Australia last year in the Tribune’ forecast, when it referred to a mass anti-<span class="highlight">racist</span> movement attacking apartheid and racial discrimination in both South Africa and Australia as being vital in the coming months, that this movement would be built up on militant mass action and would spread to support for the Gurindji and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communist controlled unionists, the so-called peace movements, Maoists, Trotskyites and left-wingers generally are hellbent on dividing the Australian nation on <span class="highlight">racist</span> issues, using the 144,000 part Aborigines and full blood Aborigines as a launching pad for their own motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not want a <span class="highlight">racist</span> society; it does not want apartheid, whether it is voluntary or enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, the LiberalCountry Party recently has been under very serious charges of infiltration from an extreme right-wing <span class="highlight">racist</span>, anti-semitic group known as the League of Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the League of Rights played on dormant <span class="highlight">racist</span> feelings in the community by its overt support of the South African sporting teams and it attempted to gain some political mileage over minor changes in the Labor Party’s immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not content with rubbishing his own Government in the strongest possible terms, he went on to reflect in a quite despicable and <span class="highlight">racist</span> fashion on 2 private citizens whose only fault was that they tried to give the Government a hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I would never suggest that they are <span class="highlight">racist</span> or racially prejudiced as a matter of party principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are to play a fruitful role in our region, if we are to have a secure place as a friendly nation among Asian neighbours, it is absolutely essentia] that neither by our policies nor our attitudes are we identified with <span class="highlight">racist</span> reactionary regimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not accidental that the only source of planned, systematic violence against persons in Australia is the <span class="highlight">racist</span> Right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been misrep-resented if it is suggested that I condone in any way or am prepared to do anything less than utterly denounce extermism of any kind that is based on <span class="highlight">racist</span> or political attitudes, especially those imported into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My experience is that these delegates almost universally had formed the view that not only are we not racists in Australia, but that we are one of the least <span class="highlight">racist</span> countries that they have visited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seemed to be something of a surprise to some of them because every time this kind of motion is launched by the Opposition, around the headlines of the world goes the suggestion from responsible people in Australia that we are racists, and then those who have not visited this country or studied our immigration laws get an impression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They come here with an impression that we are <span class="highlight">racist</span> and it is only when they visit this country that they find we are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he found we were not a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said - he had not consulted the Government - that it was only the immigration laws that were <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here was a Ceylonese who had been sold by our own responsible leaders on this type of rubbish that is talked about our <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one danger that we have to face - we could become a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country if we are not careful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the Australian Government have gone to functions where this group has held up photographs of its inspiration - Ante Pavelic, the leader of the fascist <span class="highlight">racist</span> government in Croatia from 1941 to 1944. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Croatian extremists - perhaps there are no more than 100 of them in Australia - are racists and are motivated by hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under the influence of 100 or so extremists it has become not only a movement for an independent government but for a government modelled on the Pavelic regime of 1941 to 1944, and inspired by <span class="highlight">racist</span> aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this church on 10th April every year a religious service is held to celebrate 10th April 1941, the setting up of the Pavelic fascist <span class="highlight">racist</span> regime which destroyed perhaps 800,000 people in Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether anyone here is consciously and deliberately <span class="highlight">racist</span>, but Government supporters are willing to tolerate them for political expediency because they want to win the votes of extreme right wing migrant organisations and others in Australia which are prepared to support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an attitude is not <span class="highlight">racist</span>, since it is based not on racial bigotry or superiority, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I want to deal with what was said by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  who made a ridiculous and <span class="highlight">racist</span> speech in the House today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister were in the United States of America his sort of <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitude would prevent his appointment to the Supreme Court of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not surprising, because  Mr Robert  S. Clark - who runs one of the most <span class="highlight">racist</span> organisations in this country, the Immigration Control Association, and who mainly specialises in helping the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  to beat  Mr St  John for representation in this Parliament - is a prominent member of the Liberal Party in the electorate of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and one of his most prominent helpers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in this one in relation to Germaine Greer there is undue sensitivity, I suppose, to matters pf sex which one does not always find in relation to <span class="highlight">racist</span> propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second event was the expulsion of the multi-racial Rhodesian team by a vote of 36 to 31 from the Olympic Games on the ground that Rhodesia is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a case of the Rhodesian team consisting of 37 whites and 7 blacks being expelled from the Olympic Games to suit the political aims of certain countries wanting to brand Rhodesia as <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the greatest <span class="highlight">racist</span> country of them all - Uganda - was one of the countries voting for the Rhodesians expulsion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only black African leader to protest against Uganda’s <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies was, to his credit, President Nyerere of Tanzania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The left wing in Australia has long branded South Africa and Rhodesia as <span class="highlight">racist</span> countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But neither South Africa nor Rhodesia, whatever else may be levelled at them, has ever expelled en masse people born in their countries as Uganda is doing - and doing on purely <span class="highlight">racist</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">racist</span> attack could well cause a diplomatic war here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again ask the Minister for the Interior: Was he correctly reported as saying that he personally believed the Australian League of Rights was doing a good job and will he dissociate himself from the views of this <span class="highlight">racist</span> and anit-semetic association? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a disturbing program on ‘This Day Tonight’ last night in which residents of the Northern Territory expressed attitudes that I think this Parliament would regard as <span class="highlight">racist</span> and undesirable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like it to be thought from anything I say that I object to the ABC allowing the expression of <span class="highlight">racist</span> views, because it is an unfortunate fact in Australia that there are persons who hold and express such views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to say that this meeting was <span class="highlight">racist</span>, as it was described in the Press, is not correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people at this meeting did not propose these terms of reference in a <span class="highlight">racist</span> manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we allow the attitude of these people to be described in the Press in northern Australia and to be portrayed to the rest of Australia - even to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs - as a <span class="highlight">racist</span> approach the Minister will find himself on a collision course with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members may say that I am a <span class="highlight">racist</span> because all the names are those of Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that this organisation has as its principal methods of operation the use of violence, intimidation and the creation of <span class="highlight">racist</span> anti-Jewish propaganda? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently he arrived in Katherine and decided that the town was a <span class="highlight">racist</span> part of Australia and he set out to produce his show to back up those ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was endeavouring to produce a set of circumstances which would convince the people of Australia that a meeting which took place in Katherine was a completely <span class="highlight">racist</span> meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But instead he endeavoured to describe this meeting as a white <span class="highlight">racist</span> meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he succeeded because a number of complaints I have received about that particular segment of that program have said that this man was really showing that there was this attitude in Katherine, that there were 500 or 600 people seething in a <span class="highlight">racist</span> manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will read some of the terms of reference of that committee appointed at the meeting to prove that those there were not at all <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  will be able to deal with such a <span class="highlight">racist</span> speech when he rises during the course of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole <span class="highlight">racist</span> structure was taken to such lengths that photographs were required to show whether applicants were light enough skinned to be welcomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, some of the leading articles in newspapers for whose views I often have respect even if I disagree with them, carried <span class="highlight">racist</span> assumptions that the child, in going back to her parents, inevitably was in the wrong place and would be ill-treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> assumption and it must not be allowed to be perpetuated throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be divisive and <span class="highlight">racist</span> in application to have 2 parallel systems of law in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anything came to an end on the anniversary of Austerlitz last year it was the demeaning of Australia in the eyes of the world as the country our predecessors had represented it to be: insignificant, <span class="highlight">racist</span>, militarist, sycophantic, a timid and unworthy creature of the great powers to whom it had surrendered its identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to them as having <span class="highlight">racist</span> antiAboriginal sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The charge was made that 3 Country Party ex-Ministers were <span class="highlight">racist</span> and anti-Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his emotional outburst the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said, as my 2 colleagues have mentioned, that 3 former Country Party Ministers for the Interior had shown <span class="highlight">racist</span> antiAboriginal sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it perfectly clear so that it is on the record that I am not a <span class="highlight">racist</span>, nor do I condone racism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gentleman, a guest in our country, said Australia was <span class="highlight">racist</span>, that its politics were <span class="highlight">racist</span> and that is why the 12 Fijians he was involved with personally were being required to leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is from this confusion that the motley collection of people, arrogant and selfish in their extremes, <span class="highlight">racist</span> in their attitudes, will fester - not honourable members opposite but people outside Parliament - while, the Minister continues with his equivocal statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under what seems to be a liberal exterior is the soul of a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions, far from being <span class="highlight">racist</span>, are determined to see that the skilled tradesmen who have not had the advantage of being born in this country and therefore who are not in a position to understand what their rights are under the law, are not exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without accusing the honourable member for Maranoa of being a <span class="highlight">racist</span> - lam sure he is not a <span class="highlight">racist</span> - or the honourable member for Wimmera, who spoke on behalf of the Country Party, of being a <span class="highlight">racist</span>, I must put it on the record that there is no doubt that basically the Country Party in Queensland is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that despite claims that the policy was <span class="highlight">racist</span> and represented white Australia, the undeniable fact was that it was a policy that was in the country’s best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I am shocked and dismayed that any Australian in public life would be so blatantly <span class="highlight">racist</span> in intent and words as  Mr Knox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his reported statements are true he wants an immediate restoration of <span class="highlight">racist</span> discrimination such as existed for the past 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may be regarded as <span class="highlight">racist</span>, but the White Australia policy was right and in the country’s best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obviously a call for the restoration of <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies which would align Australia with South Africa, apartheid, Rhodesia - I think it goes further than that; Nazi Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the honourable member for Bowman I say: I believe that  Mr Knox  has defiled Australia’s reputation by his <span class="highlight">racist</span> statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the bucket over Australia from our neighbours and the world if we return to the <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies of the past would drown us all as good neighbours for an entire generation, and I think that the bulk of the Australian people will reject that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring here to the <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitudes of the white majority in relation to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such Acts are a disgrace to the community and I look forward to the passing of legislation by the Australian Government to supersede such <span class="highlight">racist</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I speak on this subject no doubt there will be some people, even honourable members in this House, who will declare that I am a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that this article demonstrates that most social science textbooks now being used in schools develop and reinforce <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitudes in the students, and that the most effective way of reversing this situation is for the Curriculum Development Centre to undertake the task of preparing such textbooks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later on the gentleman who writes this vicious, <span class="highlight">racist</span> publication, one Robert Clark, under the heading ‘An Interesting Morning in Canberra’, states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its report the Australian Country Party described the League of Rights as having a disreputable and <span class="highlight">racist</span> basis, which it is now trying to conceal; declared the disciples of social credit, which Butler advocates, as sheer fanatics; quoted some of his writings on the communist conspiracy, which it then categorises as ‘the language of paranoia’; spoke of Butler’s violent opposition to parliamentary government, his long catalogue of hates; and stated that there is something breathtaking about lunacy on this scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Australian Country Party,  Mr Douglas  Anthony, has condemned the League as disreputable, <span class="highlight">racist</span>, anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is supposed to be secretary of the CAAC which at Government expense during this election campaign circulated letters on the notepaper of the Congress recommending to Aborigines that they did not support a certain candidate and suggesting that he was an ex-policeman who was known to treat Aborigines badly and belonged to a <span class="highlight">racist</span> party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Kooyong has already pointed out- I believe that all honourable members opposite share his view- that the Opposition rejects and deplores South Africa’s apartheid and <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a very old hat, unfortunate idea that a lot of people have that those who live amongst the Aboriginal people, whether they be farmers, graziers or townspeople, are antiAboriginal, therefore <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From the broadest construction of the term ‘<span class="highlight">racist</span>’, down to the inter-personal relationships between Aborigines and Europeans in Australian society, it is difficult to deny that prejudice exists and that this prejudice, over the years, has been erected into a functional system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For far too long our children have been fed in their schools, in their places of learning, a view of the Aboriginal that is inaccurate, <span class="highlight">racist</span> and discriminatory, a view that not only denies the Aboriginal rightful recognition of the contribution he made to the history of this land but also denies us as white Johnny-come-latelys access to the wisdom derived from 45 000 years living and working on this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that there are already in Australia over 1000 adult refugees from Vietnam and over 2000 refugees from Portuguese Timor, none of whom could have entered Australia under the <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies which the Government of the honourable member for Lilley, our predecessors, used to apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the office of Commissioner for Community Relations was established it was envisaged that it would play a vital role in the community, that it would deal not only with specific complaints of instances of discrimination but also would actively initiate programs to rid our country of discrimination and <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only other comment I would make in relation to the speech made by the honourable member for Grayndler is in respect of his suggestion in a Press statement he put out earlier this year that there was something <span class="highlight">racist</span> about the Government’s attitude towards immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to reports in the Press, in particular the Adelaide  Advertiser  of 20 July 1976, in which the Commissioner for Community Relations was reported as saying that the Federal Government was monitoring 23 organisations that it regarded as <span class="highlight">racist</span> and that 95 000 Australians were members of these organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the wide interest generated by the reports which the honourable member has mentioned I requested the Commissioner for Community Relations to indicate whether the newspaper reports were an accurate statement of what he had said, and also requested information on the 23 organisations which are alleged to be <span class="highlight">racist</span> and on the nature of the monitoring to which he referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The actions of the Papa Doc Duvaliers and the Idi Amins feed those racists because they say contemptibly: ‘Look at the black man in Uganda, Haiti, Guinea and elswhere; when they get power the abuse it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it fascinating to listen to the pro-Arab rhetoric of those who talk about Israel being a <span class="highlight">racist</span>, imperialist, fascist,  Zionist-  they use the term ‘  Zionist’  as an insult- and expansionist country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was one of 4 Australian Labor Party Federal members of Parliament who that year lost their seats in this House, but the only explanation he had was that he was the victim of a vicious <span class="highlight">racist</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>, I formally lay the complaint that  Mr Grassby  has made <span class="highlight">racist</span> statements reflecting upon the Japanese and detrimental to the country which gives him his $36,000 a year salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not going to suggest that the people of Australia are <span class="highlight">racist</span> in the sense that I think that the people in southern Africa are, but I do know that Australians place a heavy premium upon behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that I countered by reporting to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  under whose control the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  comes, the way that a Queensland lady felt following the claim of the Commissioner that in Japan the Japanese are taught that all Australians are <span class="highlight">racist</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem that the Commissioner for Community Relations is in the privileged position of being the only man in Australia who can go around making <span class="highlight">racist</span> utterances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most necessary that that change be made because many people in this country hold the view that  Mr Grassby  is the most <span class="highlight">racist</span> minded person in Australia and is most unsuitable to hold the position of Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What further steps have been taken since the change of government in 1975 to implement abolition of the <span class="highlight">racist</span>, feudal State settlement laws and regulations in Queensland- an action which was promised by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health and Community Welfare would be one of the most <span class="highlight">racist</span> people in any government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Queensland the most feudal and blatantly <span class="highlight">racist</span> policy still exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs claims that he is ever so much more enlightened than his benighted Queensland Government which keeps Aboriginals in a feudal and dependent state, frightened to make any decisions for themselves; which keeps them bound by regulations which were exposed in the second annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby;  which keeps them bound to ask permission before they can even ring for a doctor and sometimes forbidden to do so even in cases where serious medical and obstetric complications have arisen; which keeps them bound to get permission before they send a telegram, which is censored; which keeps them bound to get permission before they bring a visitor into a Government settlement or to go out of a settlement and come back in again; which threatens that they will not be able to draw out their money even to pay hire purchase payments if they do not toe the line of some of the <span class="highlight">racist</span> administrators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of responses which flowed from the actions of the Lands Commission seeking properly to discharge its responsibilities under law to Aboriginal people, that is, the action of seeking to purchase land for Aboriginal people in Queensland and of seeking a legal opinion about a <span class="highlight">racist</span> incident in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland Government in its policies on Aboriginal welfare has established a nasty <span class="highlight">racist</span> record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think we have to talk about the <span class="highlight">racist</span> expressions of Government supporters; all we have to judge them by is their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Kennedy really wants to know a <span class="highlight">racist</span> all he has to do is look at the State member for Kimberley in the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only is he a <span class="highlight">racist</span> by his acts but also he is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> by his comments which are recorded in court documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems absolutely incongruous to me that a person like that who is such a <span class="highlight">racist</span> and represents an area such as the Kimberleys can get back into Parliament with the majority that he achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to point out that the whole administration of Aboriginal welfare in Queensland by that State Government is infected with these <span class="highlight">racist</span> overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These thoroughly unacceptable and outmoded <span class="highlight">racist</span> principles have been enshrined in the legislation and policies on Aboriginal welfare of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed concern about racism and yet he erected fiscal barriers to ensure that the Land Fund Commission would not be able to protect the rights of Aboriginals in Queensland against the incursion of the <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies of that State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a great deal of the non-implementation of these things comes from the ready acceptance of the attack upon Aboriginal programs by people in communities who are envious, <span class="highlight">racist</span> or resent money being spent on other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is an excessively paternalistic and, quite frankly, <span class="highlight">racist</span> attitude, which assumes that Aboriginals do not have the capacity to decide for themselves what sort of lives they want to lead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
