<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In conjunction with other nations, notably the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, we wish to ensure that the people of South Vietnam have the right to live under a system of democracy, with free elections and all the freedoms that we in this country particularly enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem, as  1  understand it, is primarily a domestic one for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and the Canadian authorities to sort out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry been directed to a statement that  17  American senators have asked  President  Nixon to prohibit meal imports, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, that are being shipped to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> via Canada to circumvent <span class="highlight">United States</span> meat import quotas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Australian Government will not allow any such practices to develop which could disrupt our meat export trade to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has not the position of the Australian producer been further aggravated by previous imports of these peas from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under <span class="highlight">United States</span> meat import laws total arrivals of fresh, chilled and frozen meat in 1970 are limited to about 1,061 million lb from all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted recent experiments by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Coastguard Service using a giant rubber sausage to remove oil from a sinking or stricken tanker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is any of the Australian meat exported to Canada and later re-exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America taken into account as part of the Australian quota of meat allowed to be exported direct to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the training of pilots to fly Phantoms, 1 would say that it would normally take 4 months plus travelling time to and from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where they would be trained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister for Defence, during his time in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, shop around the American discount houses or used plane yards to see whether he can get a trade-in on the $200m equity that we have in the FI 11C aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Air seen a report emanating from Washington that the Fraser mission to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> leaves Americans confused as to what Australia really wants and that the Pentagon has made a major sacrifice in order to make Phantom F4Es available at short notice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be useful for the Senate to know that the negotiations between the Australian Government, represented by the Department of Civil Aviation, and the American airlines, represented by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> State Department, were officially concluded about 6 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Counter proposals were put to the Americans who have taken the proposals back to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to consider them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the broadcast today by  President  Nixon in which he announced that 150,000 <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops will be withdrawn from Vietnam in the next 12 months, and to his statement that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America intends to withdraw all its troops from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give the Senate an assurance that there will be no alteration in the Government’s promise that Australian troops will be withdrawn and our commitment scaled down as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> scales down the number of its troops in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is true that at about midday today, Australian Eastern Standard Time,  President  Nixon of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America made a statement to the effect that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will withdraw troops from Vietnam within the next 12 monhs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answerto the question obviously would involve a reference for the personal consideration ofthe Attorney-General.I am surprisedto hear it said that anyone is making the statement that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government signed the Geneva Convention of 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As did practically everybody in the free world, I read the statement made by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs agree with the statement of the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America,  Mr Nixon,  that the just peace we seek is in sight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my understanding that when abattoirs conform to the requirements of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America they will come back on stream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry, lt follows a question asked earlier about muttion exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister ask the Minister for Trade and Industry to make representations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration to have mutton import restrictions lifted as each export abattoir meets the health standards required by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confirm whether a team of Royal Australian Air Force members and officers of the Department of Air left or will leave Australia for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to evaluate the Phantom F4E aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne  makes his own judgment that there is something sinister in this and therefore we should start cutting off our trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the arbitrary action of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities in banning the import of certain Australian beef, veal and mutton on technical grounds, the motive for which could be open to grave doubt, will the Government give consideration to refusing the import of <span class="highlight">United States</span> automobiles, crude oil and other commodities in which there are technical faults, particularly the Fill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that recently a number of meat works lost their licences to export meat to the market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand the reason is that <span class="highlight">United States</span> inspectors walked into these works - which they have a right to do, and which they do from time to time - and found that certain facilities within these meat works were not up to the standards required for the market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Primary Industry was then requested to cease the exporting of meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> from these works until the complaints had been rectified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that this is a temporary measure and that as soon as the complaints are rectified the works concerned will be quite free to go on exporting meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should point out that about 20% of Australia’s export mutton sales is exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So although these works may temporarily lose their licences to export to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market there is no reason why they should not be able to go on exporting to other markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the meeting in Paris the Minister will visit Britain, Eire, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Malta, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada to discuss with the governments concerned problems and other matters relating to the immigration programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not received any reports yet from the evaluation team, if you like to call it that, which has gone to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Air received any reports from the team of specialists and other officers presently in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America investigating the proposal relating to Phantom aircraft and the failures of the F111 aricraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have they resolved in part any of the issues which remain between the Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> Governments including the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that some of the works will be restored to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> list fairly quickly, but at this stage it is not possible to forecast the exact time when that will happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to be restored to the list the works, first of  all,  must be inspected by inspectors from the Department of Primary Industry who must then certify to the inspectors from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Agriculture that the works are up to a certain standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recent announcement that some Australian meat export plants had had their licences to export meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America cancelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we have lost the propaganda war both here and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - because the people have not been taken into the confidence of the Government and properly informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have details ot the differences that may exist between the slaughtering arrangements in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and those in Australia, but 1 feet quite sure that the Department of Primary Industry has some information on that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discrepancy that is alleged to exist between the  standards of meat inspection in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the standards insisted upon by that country in countries which export meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall, the Prime Minister made a statement some time ago that a withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam would be made in the context of the overall situation, having regard to the decisions made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of  President  Nixon’s announcement that 50,000 <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops will be withdrawn from South Vietnam by 15th October can the Government now take this Parliament and the people of Australia into its confidence and tell us when Australian troops will be withdrawn from this futile and costly conflict? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Labour Government was in office in Great Britain at the time of cancellation of the TSR2 project, lt then placed orders in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for Fill aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen a statement by  Mr Averell  Hardman, former chief <span class="highlight">United States</span> negotiator at the Paris talks, to the effect that the Nixon Administration’s Vietnamisation policy was a programme for the perpetuation of the war and that the concept was dependent on an unpopular and unrepresentative government in Saigon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister, as I have done previously, whether he would now nol agree that parliamentarians who are elected and entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the affairs of the Australian people would command much greater respect and the confidence of those people if the whole of their income, including share holdings, were made available for public scrutiny - a practice which at present operates in many States throughout the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in Singapore under the Prime Minister,  Mr Lee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether his answer to the honourable senator in relation to withdrawals and the threat about the activities in Laos indicates some change of opinion by the Government; that it may not withdraw its promised quota of Australian troops from Vietnam, having regard to the announcement by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America that, despite the military difficulties, there will be a recognised withdrawal of <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  1 do not think it is right that I should say whether I believe the Canadian or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is unreasonable or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of food standards and the hygienic preparation of food is a public issue in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that negotiations are proceeding with the meat industry and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> veterinary services to have certain approved abattoirs here re-listed within a short period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that it was unreasonable for Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to place a ban on all mutton exported to those countries, whether the particular abattoirs conformed to the regulations or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining 18 of the total of 24 Phantoms leased from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America will arrive in Australia in batches of 6 on 19th September, 26th September and 3rd October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the problem of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and West German teachers and their educational beachcombing activities is a matter for those 2 governments and not for this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question refers to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> teachers Edward Blesch and John Smith, who claim they were assisted migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, has the Committee on Overseas Professional qualifications been asked to mediate in this apparent conflict involving <span class="highlight">United States</span> and West German teachers which makes the teachers virtually educational beachcombers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the records of the Australian Government show that 2.12 million kangaroo skins were exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America between 1966 and 1970? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that only recently the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government reallocated about 44 million lb of shortfalls in its imports of meat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government can penalise countries which fall short by redistributing their quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was why Australia was unable to reach its quota.I understand that under the <span class="highlight">United States</span> agreement there is no reason to suspect that a shortfall in a particular year would be used against a country concerned when arrangements for the following year were being determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that Australia’s exports of meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America have fallen short of the quota allowed for this year, is the Australian quota likely to be reduced in 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst revaluation of the Australian dollar has realised some savings in Qantas’ expenditure overseas, there has been a substantial reduction in the company’s revenue remittances on travel sold in other countries, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where currency changes have taken place in the past 12-18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The net effect of these exchange gains and losses on Qantas’ operating account has led the company to the decision that it would not be economically feasible for adjustments to bc made in international fares sold in Australia to take account of the changes in the value of exchange rates between the revalued Australian dollar and other currencies, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier this year the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  found it necessary to make a public statement about efforts in Australia to expose some of Australia’s most closely held secrets and to publicise allegations based on hearsay, or worse, to the embarrassment of Australia’s relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, our closest ally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in January 1975 the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, previously the major market for kangaroo products, imposed a ban on such imports under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Endangered Species Act, claiming that three species- the red, the western grey and the eastern grey- were threatened with extinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can inform the honourable senator that the view of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities conflicts with the scientific advice and evidence provided to State and Commonwealth governments and with the opinion of international organisations, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which body endorses the Australian Government’s view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1976 the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government advised that it would relax the ban if Australia presented to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> evidence of State kangaroo conservation and management programs developed in accordance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Fish and Wildlife Service’s guidelines and certified by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia duly provided the certification and documentation requested by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on kangaroo management and conservation programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite this, however, there was no <span class="highlight">United States</span> response to the Australian arrangements and no steps were taken towards relaxing the import ban, as had been undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1976 and again in October 1977 Australia made formal representations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> State Department requesting the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to take the necessary steps towards lifting the ban. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The representations informed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that the Australian Government did not consider the species of kangaroo previously mentioned to be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia was informed in December 1 977 that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was prepared to re-examine its ban on kangaroo product imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions on the matter are continuing between the Australian and State governments responsible for conservation and between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a report in the Melbourne  Sun  newspaper of 27 March which refers to the import ban placed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on products made from kangaroo hides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is it true, as alleged in the report, that the Australian Government has placed pressure on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to have the ban lifted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister any information which contradicts the belief of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Fisheries and Wildlife Service that red, eastern grey and western grey kangaroos are threatened with extinction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did the now-defunct Australian Meat Board allocate a special <span class="highlight">United States</span> export quota in 1 977, for shipment in late 1977 and early 1978, to Norwest Ltd, a company jointly owned by the Hooker and Project Development Corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and refer to the question I asked yesterday about the establishment of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence satellite communications system in the north of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it right that Australian citizens should first find out about the establishment of such a satellite communications system by reference to a <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee rather than from a statement made in the Australian Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science: Is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> delegation that came to Australia a few days ago to study the implementation of the InterScan system still in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In relation to the countries that are mining and exporting uranium, the advice I have in my brief is that Australia, Canada, France, Gabon, Niger, South Africa and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are in that category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister consider that the information provided with these products is sufficient to warn the average individual that in the opinion of the Environment Protection Authority in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America extreme care must be exercised in the use of this material, otherwise binh defects or cancer may well result? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I am making on the sophisticated approach is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Britain, if they can do so at any time, skilfully play off China against the Soviet Union in world politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should the future situation permit a further substantial withdrawal of troops - beyond those announced by  President  Nixon on 16th December 1969 - then in consultation with the Government of the Republic of Vietnam and the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, some Australian troops will be included, at some stage, in the numbers scheduled for such withdrawal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister succumbed to pressure from the new Minister for External Affairs  (Mr McMahon),  he succumbed to pressure from leading personalities in the Department of External Affairs who mounted their own Press campaign to twist the Government’s arm, he succumbed to pressure from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and he succumbed to pressure from certain people who describe themselves as left wing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted today with some perplexity that, in a question to the Leader of the Government  (Senator Anderson), Senator Georges  referred to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> withdrawal as some gigantic hoax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I really think that members of this new united - or disunited - Opposition should get together because I heard gloating questions asked by members of the Opposition, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy),  referring to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> withdrawal as a recognition of defeat by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But because of the military and political positions, and because of the success of the policy of Vietnamisation, fewer <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops are required than was formerly the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose if there can be one criticism of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> effort in South Vietnam it is that in the past it has placed too little reliance on building up the South Vietnamese forces and has made it a purely American operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A study of  President  Nixon’s speeches reveals that he has made it quite clear in the strongest terms that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is determined that aggression shall nol succeed and that his country’s objective in South Vietnam remains unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> today insists, 1 believe rightly, that the countries of South East Asia should do more to help themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is prepared to provide facilities to enable South East Asian countries to build up their own strength so that they are reasonably able to defend themselves, and only as a last resort will <span class="highlight">United States</span> forces, particularly ground forces, again be committed to serve in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Several years before becoming the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, in an article which at that time received a great deal of attention,  President  Nixon stated this policy quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said this, and having reminded the Senate that the grave danger is a loss of confidence, not only in Vietnam because of a precipitous withdrawal but also in other countries of South East Asia, I suggest that the objective of North Vietnam today is, as it has always been, to destroy the will of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> people to resist aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main sources of the investment were the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A comparison of research and development engineers shows that in Australia there are very few for every 10,000 people - far less than the ratio of 25 for every 10,000 in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, 22 for every 10,000 in Sweden, 12 for every 10,000 in Japan, 1 1 for every 10,000 in the United Kingdom and 7 for every 10,000 in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Fulbright’s  statement that while the Australian Government professed to see a threat in Vietnam, as did the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, its response was grudging and minimal and designed to earn American gratitude rather than influence the prosecution of the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government was obviously more concerned with pleasing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> millionaire investors than with saving the lives and future welfare of thousands of young Australians who have been conscripted to fight in a war condemned by all nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Supply, refers to the recent visit to Australia by  Dr Paine,  who is the Administrator of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and his published statement that Woomera may become a centre for a space shuttle service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only several months ago - I think it was during the great vacation - the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  spoke of an outstanding migrant,  Dr Doxiadis,  who is probably one of the most notable architects and city and regional planners in the world and who has been responsible for the replanning of some of the great cities of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as well as conducting universities in Athens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt appears to me that great damage will be done if, in the publicity which flows from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia in the future in regard to a pulling out of the forces which are fighting in Vietnam at present, the view is conveyed that we are no longer interested in ensuring that there is sufficient support for a country which wishes  to be  free from external aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are indications in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that the boom of recent years is losing its intensity, in the event of which the buoyancy of world economic conditions will diminish for the time being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not correct that the overseas firm Unilever Pty Ltd has the patent rights for the manufacture of what are known as Surprise peas and that this system of manufacture is being used in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in New Zealand and even in the United Kingdom for peas exported to Australia, which exports are certainly damaging the Australian industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The specific question of whether patent rights belong to Unilever in respect of the processing of Surprise peas in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and New Zealand is a matter upon which I gave the honourable senator detailed information last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister tell us why, in view of the fact that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America it is considered important to publish the birth dates to ensure that there is no nonsense about the selection, the Australian Government refuses to publish these dates but keeps them a secret from the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall take the earliest opportunity to verify the prescribed methods and procedures adopted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in regard to the drawing of the birth dates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the former Minister for Defence,  Mr Fairhall  - now  Sir Allen  Fait hall - journeyed to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America last year and attended a handing over ceremony at Fort Worth, Texas, on 5th September 1969, where he formally received and accepted the first F111C aircraft on behalf of the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that  Sir Allen  Fairhall, as he now is, who was Minister for Defence at the time, visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and, at a ceremony, received nominally an aircraft in connection with Australia’s F111 project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept, and I am sure that the Government does not accept, that this will in any way inhibit the discussions the present Minister for Defence proposes to have with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government when he visits that country in the near future.I am not in a position to give the figure the honourable senator seeks or to give an answer to his imputation in regard to that figure, which is, of course, a different matter again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Vietnam war is the only war in history which is being lost by superior forces with complete charge of the air fighting against enemy forces which, according to <span class="highlight">United States</span> official figures, have been wiped out at least twice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does not the Government owe to the people of Australia, particularly to relatives of servicemen in Vietnam, an explanation of the rise in casualties there in recent weeks, Does not the Government realise that the people of Australia will not accept lightly a steadily rising rate of Australian casualties at a time when <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops are withdrawing from Vietnam and US casualties are declining markedly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>ls  the prolongation of the talks, occurring in the face of the often expressed willingness of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to withdraw its troops from South Vietnam if North Vietnam will desist in its aggression, due to North Vietnam’s unwillingness to so desist? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, is not the current tactic of North Vietnam, its apologists and supporters directed to weakening the resolution of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia and other countries in South Vietnam supporting the South Vietnamese Government to maintain the security of that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you couple that with the recent statement of the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America with respect to a projection of America’s intentions internationally, it is obvious that we as a nation - a European nation in an Asian sea - will have to find ways and means of fending for ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim was to release air from between the outer skin and the seed, as it had been shown in earlier work in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Britain that this air slows the loss of moisture during drying, and its take-up during reconstitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that, the committees enquiring into air and water pollution were set up only because former  Senator Denham  Henty, a great Tasmanian - he was Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Supply - visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and through his official work there came to realise the great problems facing Americans because of air and water pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cavanagh  and  Senator Georges  have said that in some way - whether they mean Australia or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is never made clear - we denied the free elections, or the eleotions which were supposed to be held under the Geneva Accords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By getting out into the streets and demonstrating against the war in Vietnam they were able to excercise influence on the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> so that for the first time in the history of that country a  President  had to resign his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the total quota was not reached - for 1969-70 the wheat industry brought in quotas totalling about 357 million bushels - people in the industry appreciated the problems associated with surpluses such as storage and potential markets aggravated by vast surpluses of wheat in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the early 1950s there was an enormous surplus of wheat, especially in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By 1960 and up to 1965 stocks were at a low level as a result of restriction on acreages in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the large purchases made at that time by China and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not profess to prejudge but it is necessary to refer to some companies or persons to show that the laws are inadequate and that there is a good case for a securities and exchange commission along the <span class="highlight">United States</span> lines, adapted to suit our own experience, our own conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figure which 1 gave of $20m was taken from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Budget, a copy of which I have here and will make available to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are really proceeding through a period which was peculiar to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> prior to the commencement of the 20th century, when it had a series of bank crashes, with disastrous results, and it found it necessary to take on substantial power to control their banking institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">United States</span> passed through that first period from the end of the 19th century into the 20th century and struck the great depression in the early part of the 20th century, there began this intense interest of the investing public in investing equity capital in public companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The boom of that investment culminated in 1929 in the collapse of the stock exchange and the tremendous consequences which flowed, not only to individuals and the nation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but also throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was as a consequence of that, no doubt - -because significantly it happened in 1933 and 1934 - that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> introduced the legislation to which  Senator Wright  has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is now reaching that second position, lt is reaching in 1970 the situation that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> reached in 1900 when there was this tremendous equity investment by the general public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the cease-fire negotiations between South Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, on the one hand, and the Viet Cong and North Vietnam, on the other, still continuing; if so, is it a fact that the talks have made no progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the prolongation of the talks, despite <span class="highlight">United States</span> willingness to withdraw if the North Vietnamese will desist from aggression, due to North Vietnamese unwillingness to do so; if so, is the current tactic of the North Vietnamese and their apologists and supporters directed towards weakening the resolution of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia and other allies to maintainthe security of the South Vietnamese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister whether he has had brought to his notice an article in the ‘Canberra Times’ of 6th March 1970 which refers to a speech purported to be made by Averell Hardman, the former chief <span class="highlight">United States</span> delegate to the Paris peace talks, in which he said that the  President  of South Vietnam,  President  Thieu, had pulled the rug out from negotiations several times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major trends in world affairs with which I propose to deal are: Communist policies; the reduction of British influence east of Suez aud in particular the withdrawal of British forces from Malaysia and Singapore; the dramatic growth of Japan with the promise this has for greatly increased influence in the world at large and in our own region in particular; and the comprehensive doctrine enunciated by  President  Nixon concerning the world role of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some honourable senators may smile at such a suggestion, but when it comes to planning I think the views of honourable senators are much more important than those of the boardroom czars in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Britain or, for that matter, Australia’s Broken Hill Pty Co.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate in his capacity as Minister for Supply and as Minister representing the Minister for Defence, ls he aware of Press reports to the effect that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department will not agree to transfer any of the $200m-odd which has been paid by Australia for the FI 1 1 aircraft towards the purchase of another aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the attitude of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government., is it not time that the Australian Government put its cards on the table, informed us of the present position and allowed us to have a debate on it so that, irrespective of any bungling that has occurred in the past, the matter can be thrashed out here and Australia’s representatives can go to the negotiating table without having one hand tied behind their backs and see to it that we get a fair deal and are not done out of the $200m which we have paid- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As everybody including the Leader of the Opposition knows, the Minister for Defence is in Washington in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America at the present time, having discussions with the Defence Department and the manufacturers in relation to Australia’s acquisition of the Fill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would be quite unreal and quite absurd to suggest that whatever the views of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government were they would be reflected in a Press comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the honourable senator’s question arose out of the trouble incurred by Pan American Airways in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of our arrangement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is such that it is not within our competence to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Australia is the main supplier of raw materials to Japan, does the Government hopefully anticipate that Japan will become our military protector if and when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America withdraws from Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourthly, are they aware that as the shamrock will grow only in good Irish soil it presents none of the dangers to Australia which  Mr Quain  says derive from thistles from Scotland, rabbits from England and cactus plants from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it correct that there are no reciprocal arrangements for enforcing in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> alimony or maintenance orders made in Australia such as those which exist between Australia and a number of other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Government explore the possibility of making such arrangements in order to assist those women who have obtained orders in Australia but are unable to enforce them because their husbands or ex-husbands have gone to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government at present is considering reciprocal arrangements with several countries for the enforcement of such orders and will include in its consideration the suggestion that it should be extended to the various States of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service know whether it is correct, as alleged by a South Australian trade union secretary, that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has, under its new president, invited certain Communist unionists to visit this country; that the ACTU proposes to spend union raised funds to finance this visit; and that no such invitation has been issued to non-Communist unionists from the United Kingdom or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Negotiations with the United Slates Department of Defence have resulted in a policy designed to encourage the opportunity for Australian industry to seek work from <span class="highlight">United States</span> firms engaged on defence contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall earlier arrangements whereby a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence procurement officer was located in my Department and a post of Trade Commissioner, Supply, was established in Washington. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee of Departments will have the task of developing and carrying out a co-ordinated programme of work to promote increased overseas sales of Australian built equipment and components; to encourage co-operative research and development projects between Australian and overseas industry; and to encourage firms to take on work in Australia for overseas firms wishing to build up the Australian content of items offered for sale to the Australian armed forces and to seek sub-contracts from <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence contractors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America there is not a total exclusion of the conduct of foreign affairs between the  President  and the Congress because there are inside the Congress, and particularly in the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, certain constitutional proprieties which the Senate particularly is charged with observing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate has a constitutional entry into the area of foreign affairs and defence through its own placita, if I may use an Australian word in the context of the American Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do not want to embark on an enlargement of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional powers in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators wish to ascertain the truth of my remarks they have only to examine some of the proceedings of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What makes it worse in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is that, as Americans live in a highly libera: society, events which are supposed to be heard within the privacy of a committee are enlarged until they become public property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, enormous penalties are imposed upon the conduct of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> may be able to live with this fact, but at the present juncture in Australia we cannot live with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I wish to say in this context - and I say it quite humbly as a senator who has sat on this Committee for some years now - that I do not think that as a nation we have reached a level of maturity where we can consider foreign affairs matters in the glare of publicity in which they are considered in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would much prefer the Commonwealth or State system of distributing relief to the system which was in force in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America at the turn of the last century when, to be quite blunt about it, it was left to the political parties to buy votes by giving people coal in the winter and ice cream in the summer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable .senator can point to one statement from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - a country which he has delighted in abusing in this chamber time and again - which is critical of Australia and which supports the statement made by  Mr Whitlam,  we on this side of the chamber would be most interested to hear of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But how can the Labor Party possibly justify its association with this motley collection of no-hopers who have assembled to establish or set on foot this Moratorium, which is a miserable imitation of what has been already organised in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and, having damaged its reputation, proceed to an election and ask the people to vote for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been great moratorium demonstrations and Vietnam mobilisation demonstrations throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and they were supported by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Communist Party, in the same way as our moratorium in Australia is being supported by the Australian Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although  Mr Agnew  and the extreme people inside the Republican Party - I regard them as the worst people inside the Republican Party - have attacked a number of people inside the peace movement, inside the Vietnam moratorium and inside the Vietnam mobilisation, they have not had the audacity to accuse  Senator McGovern, Mr Lindsay, Senator McCarthy  or Professor Galbraith, a former <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador to India under  President  Kennedy, or  Mr Moyes,  a former special adviser to  President  Johnson and one of the national organisers of the Vietnam mobilisation and the Vietnam moratorium, of in any way being treacherous or subversive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least, the people within the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the leadership within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the people within Congress, when they know that their colleagues within Congress are actively participating in a great mass movement like this, are prepared to accept the right to protest as a democratic right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It Is understood that the Minister for Defence would be reporting to the Government the results of his exploratory-  and I underline the word ‘exploratory’ -  discussions, having ascertained the views of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Defence on a number of issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not achieving its territorial or military ascendancy, but it is relying upon a relentless propaganda campaign which distorts the situation in Vietnam, which ignores the fact of aggression from North Vietnam in South Vietnam and which publicises and stresses the horror of war - the horror of all war - and puts all the blame for that horror on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in order to weaken the determination of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and its allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Thursday in answer to a similar question I went into some detail as to why I could not, at that time, make any announcement as to what had taken place during the discussion that the Minister for Defence had with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been informed of some discussions that took place during their visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but as the Cabinet has not been informed of these discussions I think it would be unfair of me to make any further comment at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ aims and objectives have often been misquoted I refer to what  President  Nixon said in his State of the Union message this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following a review of the progress in the situation in Vietnam which led to the earlier <span class="highlight">United States</span> decisions to reduce the level of its forces by 115,000 by the middle of this month,  President  Nixon yesterday announced his decision to introduce a new and long range programme of <span class="highlight">United States</span> troop reductions involving the withdrawal of 150,000 men over the next 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the outstanding <span class="highlight">United States</span> Generals, General Matthew Ridgway, in his subsequent writings, was most emphatic that he did not want to see the <span class="highlight">United States</span> involved in any lengthy military entanglements on mainland Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we are talking about world affairs and the question of security, I might do no better than quote from a lengthy article by  Mr John  P.

    <p>I think that the Minister’s statement implies that, if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> lapses into pre-World War II isolationism, it is to be regretted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that one does not get very much material from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Possibly the <span class="highlight">United States</span> realises that it did back some losers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may emulate some of the more independent eastern European countries which do not go all the way with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If Australia has the temerity at any time - whether it be at the United Nations or at a regional conference - to take a view that might be slightly different to that taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that will not jeopardise our security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be argued that Canada, as a next door neighbour of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, can manoeuvre a little better than we can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  President  Johnson’s declaration was debated here in the Senate I made the observation - I have continued to repeat this observation - that, as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is our ally and we are involved in responsive obligations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and as it can ask for the return obligations from Australia, it was perfectly safe - indeed, it was proper and strategically in terms of grand strategy it was of paramount importance - that we should advance in a forward disposition into the South East Asian area because at that time we were protected in our advance positions by an alliance with the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second’ one is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, has decided that it will withdraw from the Asian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, originally decided to embark on an intrusion into the Asian mainland - we all’ remember the events following the Gulf of Tonkin incident when  President  Johnson decided on a partial disposition of American) forces on the Asian mainland, both he and  President  Kennedy having been urged by intellectual eggheads from the various universities in America who provided the advisers which both of those Presidents sought - it seemed to me to represent an abandon,ment by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of its historical1 strategic role, in defiance, I believe, of the armed forces advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those whom  Senator Mulvihill  and his colleagues; would describe as good social democrats; - the members of the Democratic Party - are always outside American interventionists, while the ironclad conservatives, whom they would despise, who provide the management qualities around which the wealth of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> evolves - the Republicans - are inside Americans who do&gt; not like committing themselves abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there has been on and off  -  I exclude from this categorisation General Eisenhower, am ironclad conservative and Republican - very little in the nature of adventures outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is when the eggheads start to be noticed that we find the <span class="highlight">United States</span> involving itself in outside adventures, or what a lot of people consider are outside adventures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think I am drawing the long bow when I say that there was great opposition inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, by the armed1 forces in particular, to the intrusion upon the Asian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been fundamental in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> strategic concept of the Pacific area that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should never intrude upon the Asian mainland but should maintain its strategic capacity, to hold the ring as it were, in the Pacific Ocean basin - that is the north and south Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what is now known, or is coming to be known, as the Guam &lt;doctrine of  President  Nixon is no more than a repetition of the general political attitude of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the global responsibility that it assumes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be clear what the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from the article by  President  Nixon - or  Mr Nixon  as he then was - in Foreign Affairs’ in 1967, and from his Guam Press release, that he believes the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should withdraw to its historical area, which is in mid-ocean, and that it should retain its strategic flexibility and options by doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has come to the conclusion that the various countries in South East Asia should do something to help themselves militarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, I assume, that inside the special relationship between the Republic of the Philippines and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the Philippines should do something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that this is the region about which the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no apologies to make for speaking as an individual here in my place in the Senate as to the change that must take place in Australia’s foreign policy and Australia’s defence because the concepts on which defence and foreign policy were directed in the 1950s and 1960s has disappeared with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from east of Suez and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> retreat - not retreat but retirement - to the area where it can exercise its greatest strategical flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the last occasion on which I spoke in the Senate on matters of foreign affairs in this particular context I explained that I thought we probably were able to help the <span class="highlight">United States</span> persuade the Government of Japan to sign the treaty, and as soon as Japan signed it we signed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in the terms that are often used, Australia must have a shield, and the shield is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we accept the shield of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, as I believe we must, then it is proper for the shield bearer to ask something of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">United States</span> asks of us is that we play some part in attempting to create an area of stability in the South East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that this should be so because in global terms in the area in which we live the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the great strategical power with a global capacity, is the only nation which basically has the same interests as we have in terms of how society conducts itself and lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, that is an additional reason why we should cleave to the treaty obligations that we owe to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> must convey to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a global power there are circumstances under terms of nuclear blackmail, for example, in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could conceivably say to Australia: “There are circumstances in which we must ask you to release us, temporarily at any rate, from an undertaking that we have given to you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of our commercial relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and north west Europe we must be able to maintain our trade routes to the north as well as across the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Precisely the same situation exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite repeated requests that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government produce evidence that the Government of South Vietnam invited the American forces into South Vietnam, that evidence has never been produced because it does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason was that we were pressured by the government of the day in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to take part in the war in Vietnam because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government badly needed as much support as it could get - moral support - for a cause which it had adopted in Vietnam but which it was experiencing extreme difficulty in selling around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if one were to read through the conditions which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government imposed on South Korea in regard to the dispatch of a second contingent of South Korean troops one would almost disbelieve that any government would impose such conditions upon another government of which it calls itself an ally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the South Vietnamese Government did not sign the Geneva agreement, nor did the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia, Britain, Russia or China because the agreement was not drawn up for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows beyond any measure of doubt that the South Vietnamese were in fact committed to the agreement and the 8-nation declaration, and the same applies to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know, of course, that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did not sign the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> did not even sign the 8-nation declaration but it did in fact issue a statement to the effect that it would not interfere with the agreement that had been reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote again from the statement which was made by  Mr Bedell  Smith, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> representative, in which he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself should have been sufficient to indicate that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did have obligations towards the agreement which had been reached but should  Senator Greenwood  or any of those who support him wish further evidence it is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not sufficient, perhaps the words of  Mr Bedell  Smith himself when he returned to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are surely evidence of the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did in fact feel itself committed to this agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no reference to the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was not committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not taking part in violence by the Vietcong but we are involved in the violence that is being committed by <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops and perhaps by some of the forces serving with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, amongst other things, that it would be a matter for extreme regret if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America sank back into the condition of isolation which pertained prior to World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, that much maligned country, has poured billions of dollars into Western Europe, Japan and South East Asia since World War II in order to rehabilitate and stabilise those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shudder to think what condition the world would be in today but for what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has certainly been a great bastion of democracy, the last one of consequence left in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> sinks back into isolation, that position will have been very largely contributed to by the people in this Parliament - who, incidentally, pleaded with the Americans 20 years ago to come and save this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America pulls out of South East Asia - and goodness knows the Americans have had their fingers burnt sufficiently - they have been the object of demonstrations and abuse all round the world because of their attitude and because of their attempt to carry out a guarantee that was given by Eisenhower, which was given by Kennedy, which was inherited by Johnson, which was inherited again by Nixon- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he be like his predecessors and call upon the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to come to our assistance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would not the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America be justified in saying: ‘We came once before when it was far from your doors and we tried to stop it, but you would have hone of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who malign the United Stales of America for trying to stop something that is coming right towards us, which is a direct threat to us - we are right in the line, and the people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are not in the line - leave me appalled as to their mentality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and to our own forces, we did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me tell you this: Had it not been for honourable senators opposite and their counterparts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the war in- Vietnam would have been over by now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a few years lime, when the situation in Vietnam falls into its proper perspective, it will be clear and plain that the attitude taken by the Labor Party, the Communists, the misguided Ministers of religion and others in this country, and their counterparts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, started the tragedy that eventually ensued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to the continuing reports from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America about the progress of tests of Fill components which are subject to fatigue cracks and other failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Minister whether the specialist air force and defence teams presently in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are continuing their investigations into these matters or have their investigations been suspended? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice that  Mr Whitlam,  the Leader of the Opposition in another place, said that in many law schools in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is a post-graduate course in legislative drafting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister whether the talks between the governments of Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> relating to the entry of American Airlines into Sydney are still deadlocked, as the newspaper reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the governments of New Zealand and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have agreed on  a slight  enlargement of the air traffic between the two countries, Air New Zealand being the carrier for the New Zealand Government and other airlines being the carriers for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This military disadvantage was endured with great forbearance by <span class="highlight">United States</span> and South Vietnamese forces - for even though the neutrality of Cambodia was being violated by the Communists, the allies continued to hope that the protests of the Cambodian Government might lead to a cessation of the North Vietnamese invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new military threat, increased in gravity, has led to South Vietnamese and <span class="highlight">United States</span> forces taking action to protect themselves by crossing the border into Cambodian territory occupied by the North Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The action taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and South Vietnam was action to protect the servicemen against attack by an enemy which was increasingly occupying a neutral nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What Australian troops and <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops originally went in to Vietnam to achieve was a support for the South Vietnamese Government against an insurgency which was backed and directed by North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think it is of shame to the Senate if the hilarity which occurred whenI referred to the fact that the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and his predecessor had engaged themselves in every diplomatic activity they could employ in search of peace and a beginning of negotiations to establish the freedom of South Vietnam came from the floor of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having the door closed firmly against him about 12 months ago the  President  then declared that a limited withdrawal of <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops would be made which would enable the campaign to be sustained by South Vietnamese forces and <span class="highlight">United States</span> forces to be brought home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to her purpose in South Vietnam and the cause to which she has committed herself there - the defence of a small nation against violent aggression - I would have thought that the gratitude for assistance in the past would earn respect for the present alliance and that, so far from disparaging the cause of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, no responsible person in the Commonwealth Parliament would denigrate her cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there are many people listening to him who were not born at that time and whom he might mislead, but the fact is that the alliance of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was welcomed as the saviour of the British Isles, and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was welcomed as a decisive ally of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We call for the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam because we believe that a continuation of Australian participation in this war is wrong, first of all because of the bloodshed which is taking place as a result of our intervention, secondly because of the hypocrisy with which every action of this Government in this struggle has been tainted, and thirdly because of the total stupidity of this Government and of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration in the policies which they have followed in Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Aiken  said was this - and I think it is something that ought to be repeated: As nobody knows what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is trying to do inside Vietnam, the best course for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration to follow would be to declare that it had won the war and withdraw all the troops immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The account of the origin of it appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald’ of 5th March which reported that Professor Medlin of Flinders University, South Australia, announced after a meeting of peace groups in Canberra last November, that ‘the Moratorium would be held in Australia in April or May and would duplicate the Moratorium held in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> last year’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cambodia, another part of the former French empire in Indo-China, has been ruled with brilliant but erratic skill by Prince Sihanouk, the king turned politician, but towards the end of 1963, the prince seemed to have decided that in time China was going to rule over everybody anyway, and asked the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to drop its aid programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since nearly all South East Asia’s Communists are inspired and helped from outside the area, and since the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and other Western powers have tried to counter their progress, South East Asia–  as we all know -  has become one of the world’s major theatres of the cold war - indeed the area, above all others, Where the cold war, in reality, has been ‘hot’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume that the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry is aware that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has put a ban on the import of mutton from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the latter part of the honourable senators question, I made some inquiries from the Department of Primary Industry this morning and was informed that  Mr Anthony  was told by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary for Agriculture,  Mr Hardoin  that there was deep concern at the high rejection rate of Australian mutton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost 1,000,000 lb had been rejected in the middle of April indicating that much of the mutton shipped by Australia was not meeting <span class="highlight">United States</span> standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Secretary subsequently reported that it was inevitable that there would be a decision to place a temporary ban on the import of mutton from Australia until the general standards of hygiene and of mutton inspection in Australia came up to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> decision is that mutton produced in Australian meatworks after 15th May will not be eligible for export to America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This restriction will remain in effect until the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities are satisfied that Australian procedures comply with American standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have any doubt that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is entitled to place certain standards on the quality of mutton it imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 refer to the very strict conditions which are applied in regard to the type of cattle suitable for the meat trade in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the flag of the Vietcong may have greater elevation than that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am brought into this debate by the extraordinary statements which have been made by  Senator Cavanagh  and  Senator Georges  to the effect that they find greater respectability in the Vietcong and, presumably, North Vietnamese flags than in the flag of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> launches attack after attack on the sanctuaries - on main supply routes and supply bases - the action becomes one of aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more respect in the world than the flag of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by reminding the Senate that in  1960-61,  long before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was involved,  6,000  South Vietnamese village leaders, teachers, medical personnel, people who exercised some authority, were murdered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand it applauds the intervention by America in Cambodia an action which, incidentally, has been condemned by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate Committee as recently as yesterday; and on the other hand, the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr McMahon)  is urging upon the countries which will attend the conference in Indonesia the need to set up inspection in Cambodia and Vietnam if that is found to be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason and because of the interest of the Vietnamese people in the National Liberation Front in areas of South Vietnam that the NLF has controlled for up to 15 years, the Government cannot cope with the situation and is relying on its friends - the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and ourselves - to hold the position by military means, which finally we will find will be incomplete and unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear references to the Vietcong flag being more highly regarded than the <span class="highlight">United States</span> flag in some parts of the world, it seems to me that such remarks are better not made, when we are dealing with our allies and we have been very proud in past wars to fight alongside them and to work with them under their flag and our flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it suits you, and if you do not like another nation’s philosophy, and if you have control of the industrial and military complex that is astride the world today, centred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, you just go to war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that the presidents of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, such as former  President  Johnson and present  President  Nixon, are not in control of the machinery of government in that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no war if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government was influenced by peace seeking people, but there would be an enormous repercussion on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> economy, which would bc thrown into a state almost of major depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the suspension of the sitting I was pointing out that it had appeared as though the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had become severely divided within itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  President  Nixon claims that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is the strongest, the greatest and the most powerful nation in the world, a nation which is divided to the extent that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is divided, I would suggest, creates a precedent the like of which has never been understood or realised before in a nation of such strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But here we see a situation in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is fast losing its credibility in the light of what is claimed by the  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration must realise that every time there is a demonstration against the United Slates in the national capital of that country, throughout the world <span class="highlight">United States</span> credibility and status is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we suggest that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Hag is losing some of its popularity throughout the world we are accused of being subversive and of being all kinds of nasty people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation has become out of hand because the industrial and military people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have taken the administration out of the hands of the Parliament and virtually out of the President’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the tricks and techniques of the Germans have been followed holus-bolus by this complex in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and there is no doubt that it has lost nothing in its interpretation of the philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many millions of dollars profit are being made through the perpetuation of war and wherever it is occurring throughout the world the smutty finger of the industrialists and militarists of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> can be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This helps the military and industrial economy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to get rid of its surplus arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without the need for vast industrial armament industries, the like of which the world has never known, not only would there be the present rate of unemployment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but also there would be an unemployment rate more than twice the existing rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the number engaged in these industries to supply countries, not only where the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has military representation and a substantial number of troops but also other countries, their unemployment rate is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that they import our bulls because hamburgers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are almost the staple diet of the average American. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ever wanted to see that agreement work so that there would be an election, within 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time President Eisenhower of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> said that if an election were to be held within 2 years 80% of Ho Chi Minh’s supporters would vote for unification and would vote for a government suitable to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we ever survive the present trend in world affairs, when the history of this war is written we will find that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was the focal point on which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was talked into being committed to the Vietnam war by the military and industrial complex advisers and also by the secret organisation, the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a supranational organisation, which combines the American military, spy and intelligence systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My purpose tonight is to report on the results of the recent mission which I led to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to discuss with Secretary Laird and his  Deputy  Secretary Packard and other Defence officials, problems concerning F111 aircraft and the need for Australia to get into its inventory a strike bomber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that subsequent to discussions I had with  Dr J.  L. McLucas, the Under Secretary of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of the Air Force, in December last year and taking account of further unanimous advice provided to mc by the members of the July 1969 Bland Mission to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; the Government decided and 1 announced on 5th December that we were sufficiently satisfied that we had protection in regard to the wing carry through box problem and that we would be reactivating our 24 FI 1 1C aircraft with a view to bringing them to Australia at an early date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, 1 was directed by the Government to pursue these questions in direct negotiation with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My discussions were wide ranging and, in addition to Secretary Laird and his Deputy Secretary Packard, 1 and members of my delegation negotiated with Department of Air Force Secretary Seamans, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force Chief of Staff General Ryan, Lieutenant General Glasser and other officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members who studied these documents closely will be aware that their broad intention was that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force should specify to the contractor, and control the development of, an aircraft with a very high operational capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time we were confident that the aircraft would satisfy Australia’s requirements because those requirements were fully encompassed by the capability then being pursued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will also see that the practical effect of these documents was that, taken together, they gave the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the overriding authority to modify or downgrade the aircraft’s specifications if for some reason it felt that it became necessary or unavoidable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It followed that, when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities did this, Australia was bound to accept any aircraft delivered in accordance with such downgraded specification, provided of course similar aircraft were accepted by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had confidence in the ability of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - with its unsurpassed achievements in aeronautical science and technology - lo translate the design concept into an aircraft of uniquely high performance entirely suitable for Australia’s needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> view has been that both governments went into the development of this new aircraft together and that we should each be responsible for our own investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, if General Dynamics failed to produce an effective aircraft, we would lose our Australian expenditure without remedy beyond any which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could pursue on behalf of both of us with the company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This then was the Australian position and the extent of our rights as they existed prior to my visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was pleased when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> saw fit to stop fighting the battle with one arm behind its back, when it went into Cambodia to attack the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He yelled to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to come to our aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prime Minister, but a Labor Prime Minister who called to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt would be the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that, just as in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America at this time, the majority of the Australian people are opposed lo Australia’s participation in the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that his hopes are doomed to be dashed in this matter because even the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has said that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> intends to withdraw its troops from Cambodia approximately 7 weeks from now at the latest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has no intention of staying inside Cambodia for any long period - certainly not until such time as the Government and people of North Vietnam have been defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other argument which  Senator Wood  raised - an argument which we have heard frequently - was the argument concerning the insurance policy which we were supposed to be obtaining from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America by sending forces into Vietnam; the old argument has been that if we were to do something for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> now the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be so impressed by our 3 battalions of conscripts that whether or not its national interests appeared to demand it the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would come to our rescue at some time in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this argument was put forward first it was pointed out that it was palpable nonsense, that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would come to our assistance only if it believed that it was in its national interest to do so, and that it would not come to our interest in some future conflict if it did not believe this to be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration and every national leader in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have made it clear that, whatever the outcome of the present conflict in Indo-China may be, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> does not intend to participate in future conflicts of this nature in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very cheap insurance policy whereby we hoped to obtain the support of all the armed forces of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America by sending a couple of battalions of conscripts to Vietnam has been cancelled already by the insurer before anybody has made any demand for the payment of damages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has made it perfectly clear that in no wars of this nature in future will it become involved in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to be said that because members of the Australian Labor Party are opposed to the American intervention in Cambodia we are treacherous and we are subversive, the Government will have to concede that a majority of the members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate also are treacherous and subversive because the viewpoint of the Australian Labor Party - the viewpoint of honourable senators sitting in opposition in this chamber - on the American intervention in Cambodia is the same as the viewpoint of a majority of members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sena:or WHEELDON- If  Senator Young  wishes to say that a majority of members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate are traitors and subversives, he is entirely at liberty to do so but 1 do not think this statement would be taken seriously by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told - and  Senator Wood  repeated it tonight - that we are fighting in Vietnam and we are supporting the invasion of Cambodia by troops of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America because we stand for freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969 he applied for a visa to re-enter the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in order to give another series of lectures, but his visa was refused when objection was taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Justice Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 know that  Senator Greenwood  will now think that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has refused him a visa we should do the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Justice Department was condemned by the New York ‘Times’ as well as by Professor J. K.

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry in a position to say whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America’s ban on Australian mutton has been imposed because export inspections are below standard or, as suggested in some quarters, is it merely political because of pressure by what is known as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> meat lobby? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the latter is the case, will the Government make strong representations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and even consider retaliation in kind regarding some American imports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe it would be quite wrong to make assumptions that the reason for the ban on the export of mutton to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is anything more or less than what it purports and sets out to be - that our Australian killing conditions do not come up to American requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that we must meet the American requirements if we wish to sell meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s question is based on the assumption that the ban may have been imposed because of political lobbying in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the current position in relation to accommodation charges for each of the Fill aircraft in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, a storage charge having been struck at the time when the aircraft was found to be faulty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the cost to Austrafia of the various specialist and scientific parties which either visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or had to attend investigations into particular failures of the aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A close examination is to be made by the Department of Air of the methodology of pricing with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force to determine the agreed methodology for final pricing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Can the Minister say whether there is in existence in Washington what is known as a paid meat lobby consisting of persons whose principal function is to induce the Administration to reduce as far as possible the amount of meat imported into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must accept the position al its face value until it can be shown that our abattoirs meet the <span class="highlight">United States</span> requirements, at which point - and here I refer to the question asked by  Senator Bull  - they may recommence exporting to America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry yesterday that the rejection rate of Australian mutton exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had amounted to about  1  million lb up to the middle of April and that Australian meat was not meeting the standards necessary for entry to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, refers to the question asked earlier by  Senator Lillico  and the answer given in respect of the employment of lobbyists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I said was that political lobbies are part of the political scene and political life in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask again: Is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> insisting upon the payment by Australia of charges for storing <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these amounts which the Minister has mentioned include also the cost of the special visits to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of scientific and specialist teams which were investigating the aircraft or are they separate payments charged to the Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of charges for storage in which the honourable senator and his colleague  Senator Toohey  have been very interested for some months is still under negotiation with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Defense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the cost of specialists going to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, this figure is not known to me at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask for permission to incorporate in Hansard an extract from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional Record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not expect  Senator Wright  to make a judgment on this, but my motive is to have incorporated in Hansard a summary of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation on endangered species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point 1 like about it, among other things, is that it consistently uses the words ‘after consultation with the affected States’ and then goes on to say how the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of the Interior can work in tandem with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only major country which has not declared itself on this issue is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and there an official study regarding increased metric utilisation is in progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had initially from  Senator Cavanagh  the bald statement that the Vietcong flag has more respect than the flag of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been scenes witnessed in Melbourne in the demonstration outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> consulate never before experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think arguments such as that might suitably have been addressed to the old-time vigilantes of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> because when people take the enforcement of the law into their own hands and outside lawful authority in an endeavour to create what amounts to a substitute police force they take another step which can be used by those who desire to utilise such forces for unlawful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This may explain, he said, why despite our success in developing small units of defence like the Ikara missile and exporting it, we must depend on countries like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to develop our major items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister take action to protect Commonwealth meat inspectors from being blamed for the results of an American tactic to use health measures to erect a barrier against <span class="highlight">United States</span> imports of Australian mutton? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry know, or has he any means of verifying, whether reports that I have read are correct when they say that the slaughtering and inspection facilities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> do not reach the standards laid down by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities for Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the claims that have been made by the Government, that one of the primary reasons for our sending troops to Vietnam was to raise the estimation of this country in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, does the Government consider that the refusal by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration to admit Australian mutton to America is an indication that the insurance policy which we were allegedly taking with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is paying off? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government consider making representations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration, suggesting that in view of the sacrifices that we have made in Vietnam in order to obtain American friendship, the least the <span class="highlight">United States</span> can do is to import our mutton? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial part of  Senator Wheeldon’s  question is completely unrelated to the final part which refers to the import of Australian mutton into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Kingdom of Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, the Kingdom of Laos, the People’s Republic of China, the State of Vietnam, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were represented at that conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> which did not sign the Accords produced a statement of its own, a unilateral declaration, in which it said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only countries which have agreed are the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This claim was generally considered to be reasonable until doubts were raised in the minds of members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dear  Mr Secretary:  As you know, questions have been raised, from time to time, concerning the circumstances under which <span class="highlight">United States</span> combat forces were first sent to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was blown up for the sake of getting the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives and the Seriate to approve this mighty expenditure which actually brought the <span class="highlight">United States</span> so heavily into the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know, of course, that we are there at the request of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That justifies what  Senator Cavanagh  said, namely, that the bigger percentage of the people of the world today would rather see the Vietcong flag flown than see the <span class="highlight">United States</span> flag flown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it hurts Government senators to hear this because they have been supporting the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which is undeniably the most violent country in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that it is having its effect not only on the Government in Australia but also on the Government in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been reports that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate is considering discontinuing the finance necessary for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to participate in the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over 1 million people have been killed in Vietnam since the intervention there of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told in the early stages by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> general in charge of Allied forces in South Vietnam that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> increased its military commitment by another 50,000 troops the war would be over very quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another 50,000 <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops were committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> increased the number of its troops in South Vietnam to about 500,000 but the war continues without any end in sight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So <span class="highlight">United States</span> planes bombed North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now obvious that the escalation of the conflict by the invasion of Cambodia by <span class="highlight">United States</span> troops, supported by South Vietnamese forces, will not bring the confrontation to a close any more quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the majority of Vietnamese, poor peasants in the defoliated countryside and destitute workers in the city slums, it is what they have been witnessing for a long time: the search and destroy missions; the ‘free zone’ strikes; the BS2 saturation bombings; the Phoenix operation which from December 1967 to December 1968 killed 18,393 civilian Vietcong cadres; the Song My (‘Pinkville’) type of breakfast massacre in which an American infantry unit allegedly shot down some hundreds of men, women and children in  a  captured village in the early morning of 16th March 1968; the atrocities regularly described in national <span class="highlight">United States</span> magazines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are trying to pretend that we are in Vietnam at the request of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but our only purpose in being there is to save face with America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> intervened in Vietnam it was the only country which invaded Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only recently I read a report of a hearing of the Special Sub-Committee on Sea Power of the Committee on Armed Services of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives, in which reference was made to the tendency, even in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, continually to recondition old vessels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has reached the stage at which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities are extremely concerned about the fact that they have a Navy which is essentially an old Navy, and that the expenditure of vast sums of money on so many of their old units simply has not paid off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 shall read from an article in the October 1969 edition of the ‘<span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Institute Proceedings’, which describes in some detail the sinking of the Israeli destroyer ‘Elath’ by the Russianbuilt missile boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the undermentioned payments to the sterling area and non-sterling area would be predominantly for material of United Kingdom and <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America origin respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was with this imported foreign quota arrangement that these countries were able to get their Canadian films and British films effectively on to the world markets, particularly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia can never make films’, and that the business of film making is- ‘best left to those countries (meaning the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America who can do it better than we can”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In correspondence he has exchanged with me he has suggested that to be able to run a viable film industry Australia should have a home production of not less than 10 feature films per annum and that these should all be produced in colour because the eventual residual rights for television programmes, particularly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, demand the use of colour and are too valuable to ignore here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 considered that we were suffering, if that is the right word, from the fact that we are an English speaking country and that both the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America have nourishing film industries in the English language and that, therefore, a country with u population the size of ours and with the need to develop in so many directions could not possibly afford to develop this industry in competition with either the United Kingdom or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overproduction of primary products is occurring in the European Economic Community, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and in most other areas in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of quotas operating in the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America anil shrinking markets in other parts of the world, the prospects of selling this surplus are remote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary industry: ls it a fact that there is a professional meat lobby in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America paid for from the resources of the Australian Meat Board? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it part of the responsibility of that organisation to promote the interests of the Australian meat industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What advice was received from that body that plans were afoot to impose import restrictions on Australian mutton on the pretext of failure to meet <span class="highlight">United States</span> hygiene requirements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now wish to inform the Senate that I did refer the report of the parliamentary delegation to the Australian Tourist Commission on 23rd September 1969 for its consideration and after consideration of the matter the Tourist Commission advised that it was not appropriate to participate in the Montreal Exposition mainly because the area is one from which comparatively few visitors are derived for Australia and also because the Commission was then mounting ‘the largest promotional and publicity exercise ever attempted in North America, concentrating in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America that we see today that is pouring so much investment into this country, in relation to which there seems to be some opposition, was built up through people bringing money into the country and investing it there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That indicates that British investors were in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to a very great extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I still think that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - and I believe this to be correct - there is still a lot of money which has been imported from other countries and which has been invested which is helping to develop the <span class="highlight">United States</span> even further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much in the background of any of these discussions is the reference to the system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which over and over again is held up as a very good example of how a committee system works in a total legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as every honourable senator knows, has a congressional system, which is sometimes described as a ‘committee system’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our system is a parliamentary system which is essentially a Cabinet system with Ministers and leaders selected from the elected representatives of the people, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the committee system has been going for a long lime and over a period of years the committees multiplied to such an extent that a few years ago a legislature reorganisation Act which reduced the number of Senate committees from 33 to 15 and the number of House committees from 48 to 19 was introduced because the system had reached the stage at which the com.mittees were usurping the power and the right of Congress and of the Senate, which comprised elected people who were entrusted to carry out particular duties within the framework of the established congressional system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the Government should not rely too much on getting from overseas suppliers, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, large machines, parts for those machines, smaller machines and various types of aircraft which we could manufacture in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aircraft industries in countries such as the United Kingdom, France and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are much better geared to volume production than we could ever hope to be at this stage of our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that in more recent times we entered into an agreement with the General Aircraft Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to build certain parts in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contractual arrangement with this company depends upon certain things being done in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America before we begin to build the airframes and parts that are to be made in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Currently the situation persists in which a local series of programmes produced on budgets of between $14,000 and $20,000 must compete unaided with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> series produced at from $150,000 to $200,000 per episode but sold in Australia for as little as $5,000 per episode. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the statement also mentions that $2,000m will be invested in synthetic meats in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the near future will the Minister take steps to see that the subject of synthetic meat is put on the agenda for the next meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council so that a suitable policy on the subject as between the Commonwealth and the States can be formulated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for Defence, in the statement he made following his visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, said that $US252m was the amount which had been authorised for this project, but at the same time he hinted that there could be further costs which have not been taken into consideration at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even at the design stage, which would be 3 or 4 years prior to the aircraft being put into the air, there would need to be  a  prime market for this aircraft in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Europe or some other place for the proposal to be viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If GAC entered into an arrangement with a substantial <span class="highlight">United States</span> manufacturing company for the production of the aircraft we would naturally seek to re-negotiate the contract which we hold, under which wings and nacelles were to have been manufactured in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the history of national health schemes in Great Britain and New Zealand as well as the counterpart national health scheme in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of Amenca, known as Medicare, will show that constant high level guerilla warfare has existed between the authorities and drug companies concerning overcharging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime it may be premature to take action as suggested, particularly as the limit for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> passenger is related to economic circumstances in the USA and would be excessive as a general rule in Australian conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Qantas Airways Ltd is operating in countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where the value of awards is very high as opposed to those awarded in the less developed countries where the amount likely to be awarded to an insured person would never be  s  15,000, let alone $30,000 or $52,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have discussed with various people concerned with the administration of the airlines in Australia the question of the press the button insurance tickets which are available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and it seems that there are many undesirable elements in relation to that type of insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr Odgers  and the Standing Orders Committee in its report prepared for us have reminded us, many legislatures in the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and New Zealand have adopted, in ways to suit their own conditions, the committee system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks parliamentary approval to borrowings by the Commonwealth of up to$US100m for the purchase of general defence equipment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the Loan (Defence) Act 1966, the Commonwealth arranged borrowings of $US450m to assist in the purchase of defence equipment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those borrowings were almost completely committed by orders placed up to last December, and the Government wishes to make provision under the present Bill for further borrowings to finance orders placed from the beginning of this year for additional purchases of defence equipment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The loans arranged under the 1966 Act were all with the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expected that the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will provide the loan funds to be raised under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">United States</span> youths cannot be forced to fight in what they conscientiously believe to be an unjust war, why should Australian youths have been imprisoned and why should 50 more be facing prison sentences because they object to fighting in the Vietnam .war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The books which have been prohibited are not only books that offer a critical analysis of Australia’s position in Asia and of Australia’s position inside Vietnam in particular but also books  which put forward a view which supports that of the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in respect of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an article in today’s ‘Australian’ regarding a statement by the Secretary of Defence in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America,  Mr Laird,  to the effect that he was not committed to buying another 40 Fill aircraft and a statement by  Senator Charles  Percy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in which he described the FI 1 1 project as a disaster aud said that the money involved should not be added as another strain on the economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But how can it be retained when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada are selling wheat at 10c a bushel below the arranged price? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see any Country Party in Canada or in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but apparently the effect of the wheat problem has spread to those 2 areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The picture in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is much the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At 30th June last year the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wheat surplus was about 800 million bushels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the legislation proposes the borrowing of some $US100m from the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for the purchase of defence equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The type is not specified - in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now putting the aircraft under wraps in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and it will be there until 1973 or 1974 when one hopes that all the problems associated with it have been ironed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we can learn from this legislation is that it is expected that the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will provide the loan funds to be raised under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot be sure that it will be possible to borrow this money from the ExportImport Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the second reading speech makes abundantly clear, we intend to go on the market to borrow $!00m, and it is expected that the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will1 provide the loan funds to be raised under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this is a myth because we have had in Australia a higher level of employment in manufacturing industries than exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the consumption of apparel wool in 1969 reached the lowest level since the war; it went to 9% be:ow the figure for 196S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handling costs from the wool grower’s store to the point of entry in the importing country were $28.1.2 for each bale of wool exported to the United Kingdom, 523.83 to Japan and $30.20 to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cited an amount of about $28 as the handling cast of a bale of wool shipped to England and about $30 for a bale of wool snipped to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the most famous example of this doctrine concerns the treaty making power in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> gives an undertaking that a treaty will be entered into by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that has always been understood to mean that it is subject to the necessary advice and consent being given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some countries they have collective bargaining - in Great Britain to a degree and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government consistently has complained about the use of the strike weapon - a weapon which is freely available to trade unionists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government imitates the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America so far as the Vietnam war is concerned but certainly not so far as its labour policy or its standards of civil liberties are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it was by interjection that North Vietnam was raised when I was referring to the industrial law of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which bears upon section 109a of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That section is completely contrary to the trade union law of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that  Senator Greenwood  could have understood me very well because the point I was making was that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, there not being compulsory arbitration, there is no  president  or anybody comparable to the  president  to whom industrial disputes can be referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is no compulsory arbitration machinery and for that reason there is no counterpart of the  president. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether statistics are taken in relation to the duration of industrial disturbances or whether the aggregate working hours lost are taken, it will be found in the main that strikes are not as long in duration as in Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator expressed to me earlier today his interest in obtaining information as to the amount of meat being exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America under the quota system, so I have obtained the following information for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In setting up a standing committee of the Senate it is necessary to impose a time limit system in order to avoid the situation that has developed in the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where standing committees of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate use the system of standing committees to bottle up legislative processes, according to the dominance of the party that holds the greater numbers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the view of one of the members of the legal Opposition in South Vietnam - that far from the consequences of <span class="highlight">United States</span> intervention being the defeat of Communism - if that is what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is striving for in South Vietnam - the consequence of the continued American military presence will be at the end of 3 years the total Communising of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find that history, to which the Prime Minister referred in his statement, has now pushed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> so far that even  Senator Barry  Goldwater finds it necessary in the interests of his country, as he sees it, to join forces with  Senator Hatfield  in proposing a Bill to abolish the draft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mayor Lindsay has said repeatedly that not only is he opposed on moral grounds - on grounds of international sanity - to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy in Vietnam, but also that American participation in the war in Vietnam is completely corroding and demoralising the life of America itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot see any reference by responsible Americans interested in social questions to the growing problem of crime or to the growing problem of drug addiction in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> without sooner or later seeing reference to the problems which have been brought about in that country through the divisive, corrupting and brutalising effects of American participation in the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He says this about the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and I believe that it applies to the position in Australia to the same extent as it does to the position in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would not do this alone but in conjunction wilh other powers such as the United Kingdom and France, which has some interest in the Indian Ocean area, and perhaps the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which is showing an interest in the area although not a very strong one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally, as a Department we are confronted all the time with increasing demands from international air carriers - particularly those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America  -  to fly into Australia, lt does not therefore appear to us that the charges have inhibited Australian opportunities in aviation in any sense at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, if it had not been for the massive demonstrations of dissent in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and, to a lesser degree in Australia, in regard to our participation in Vietnam we would not be as far advanced in the matter of withdrawal as we are at present, so do not let us underestimate the value of dissent and of demonstrations of dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gives me no pleasure that this country is so grievously divided on the question of our participation in Vietnam, lt should be a lesson to us, as it has been a lesson to the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that no country can fight a war unless its people genuinely believe in the cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps Government speakers will explain why Linus Pauling was allowed into Australia in 1964 from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America perhaps to speak on an antiVietnam platform, why General Hugh Hester was allowed in in 1967 from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to speak on an anti-Vietnam platform, why Doctor Connor Cruise O’Brien was allowed in in 1968 from Ireland to speak on such a platform, why Felix Green was allowed in in 1968 from the United Kingdom to speak on such a platform, and why Professors Schiller and Whittaker were allowed in in 1969 to speak on anti- Vietnam platforms, and yet  Mr Dick  Gregory has been prevented from entering Australia in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether we like it or not, it is a plain fact of life that the siphoning off of an excessive amount of money for expenditure in South East Asia has contributed to the inability of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Treasury to meet some of the urban problems that have racial overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If supporters of the Government want to be so sensitive about Vietnam, I ask them to ponder on this: If you are going to disparage the role of Australian servicemen in South Vietnam, if you want to look at it in that way, why do you not have a go at <span class="highlight">United States</span>  Senator Fulbright? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I venture to suggest that someone who has the reputation of having done a great deal to ensure that there was no recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and did not meet the just requirements of public order and the general welfare in a democratic society is someone who may well be not admitted to this country to carry on in the way in which he obviously has carried on in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will concede that  Mr Gregory  is a person whose freedom of movement is affected, but he is a national of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Australian Government has no obligation to promote the freedom of movement of nationals of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be reasonable to expect that when members of the Government parties and the DLP were supporting a proposition which denied the rights of a particular individual, a citizen of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, to come in to this country, very cogent arguments would need to be presented as to the character, behaviour, and associations of that man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A number of people with convictions have been admitted, but as I understand it, the convictions which  Mr Gregory  has received during the course of his career were imposed on him because of his activities in the civil rights movement in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly  Mr Walter  Reuther, former  President  of the United Automobile Workers of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, who suffered convictions during the labour troubles of the 1930s, should not have been admitted to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might give some indication of the manner in which  Mr Gregory  conducts himself if I were to refer to part of the judgment of  Mr Justice  Hugo Black of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court, which was delivered on 10th March 1969. lt refers to the episodes which took place in Chicago at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would take it from listening to  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Rae,  whom 1 find it very difficult to mention without a feeling of very strong distaste, that all of those persons in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who over the past 10 years have taken part in that great civil rights movement, that great movement to liberate a depressed minority of the American people, should be prevented from coming into Australia if they wished to visit this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I read the facts, countries like Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France have shown a tendency, in the gathering of revenue, to move towards the principle of indirect taxation, the principle of the user paying the tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not also true that in the face of such an unequivocal indication of intention any total withdrawal of <span class="highlight">United States</span> and allied troops from South Vietnam before South Vietnam is able adequately to resist this aggression would simply be to ensure that Communist aggression must succeed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister agrees with  Senator Greenwood’s  contention that forces of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia must remain in Vietnam until such time as South Vietnam can stand on its own, can he say how long the Australian Government is prepared to accept such a commitment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making that recommendation the Committee is not seeking to emulate some  ot  the revolutionary governments in South America, lt is emulating the State of Maine in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where a small levy of 3c has been imposed on every barrel of oil from a refinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to anybody who claims that there is no need for a national approach, or a uniform and co-ordinated approach to overcome this problem, that he should study the <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience over the last 50 or 60 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the past in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in other countries and in Australia a completely fragmented approach has led to a complete failure to overcome the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not a lack of legislation, a lack of money or a lack of will, but it was a lack of uniformity and of coordination which caused the largest part of the problem which is besetting the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because so many towns in the west of New South Wales are practically dependent for their economic survival on being able to export mutton to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, will the Minister take steps to ensure that the inspections carried out in Australia by the 5 American inspectors are conducted fairly and not capriciously, and that the inspectors do not exceed their authority in regard to the overall general standard of hygiene? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has been a pioneer in the sphere of social welfare and social services oyer the years, it introduced a comprehensive system of age pensions long before either Great Britain or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, 2 countries with which we frequently have been compared and on which we are frequently modelled in all broad areas of social advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was any doubt about what many of us said before that campaign it was made quite apparent by the Moratorium itself because on that day in the various capital cities of Australia we saw processions and marches under Vietcong flags, under Communist flags and under the flag of Red China, but a <span class="highlight">United States</span> flag or an Australian flag was scarcely to be seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Vietcong banners, the adulation of the North Vietnamese, the denigration of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia would be more easily tolerated if there were balancing demands for North Vietnam to halt its aggression and for the Vietcong to halt their slaughter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that in most places where forces of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are stationed to keep the peace war breaks out which invariably involves other nations that are tied - mainly on economic grounds - to the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the situation in Europe today, the really great factor in the recovery of Europe after the War was the help that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government gave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I saw the article - and I have not had a chance to read it in depth - I accepted it on the premise on which the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America made it and that is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and to the peace of the world is probably the most significant contribution of any nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The business to business work done by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Post Office, through letters and telecommunications, consists of about 75 per cent to 80 per cent of its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>..fs the Minister aware of reports that suggest that earnings of airlines in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are falling drastically? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>ls the Minister aware that, whilst a situation exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in which the volume of traffic carried last year rose by more than 10 per cent, earnings showed the greatest decline in the airline industry’s history? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yes,  I  most certainly am aware of the very dramatic fall in profitability of airlines in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, particularly those engaged in the domestic traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  think the honourable senator probably will find that this is because of what 1 would describe as excess capacity in airline business in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Air seen a report in today’s Press to the effect that yesterday the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives approved of the payment of certain moneys for 40 Fill aircraft which have completed severe tests and been found to be structurally sound for use by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister also seen the reported comments of the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House Armed Services Committee,  Mr Mendel  Rivers, who was formerly a critic of the Fill aircraft, to the effect that he has taken a 180-degree turn following the successful testing of the aircraft and now fully supports it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have informed the Senate previously, technical and scientific officers of the Department of Defence and the Department of Air, are monitoring both in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in Australia the testing programme of this aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to remind .the Senate and the honourable senator who asked the question that when the Fraser mission visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in April the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of Defence agreed to meet the specified operational and technical requirements which we believe are necessary if this aircraft is to perform a strike role in the Royal Australian Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a statement in the ‘Australian’ of today’s date attributed to <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate Republican Leader Scott that the present Administration has been eminently successful in winding down the war in Vietnam and in assuring the American  people that America’s involvement in this tragic venture is quickly coming to an end, as well as his prediction that a major favourable announcement will be made by  President  Nixon in the next few weeks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Air aware of the reported decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives yesterday approving the payment of $283m for 40 Fill fighters which the Defence Department said had been found ‘structurally sound’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister for Supply relates to 2 comments which the Auditor-General has made in his last 2 annual reports - no doubt they have been brought to the Ministers attention - about the purchase in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of 307 amplifiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the amplifiers do not meet the specifications of the Australian Army they are presently stored in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army Stores Depot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it result: from incorrect specifications being set down by Australian purchasing bodies, or from faulty manufacture in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the recent withdrawal of participation by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in the communications system known as Project Mallard., which was to have been a global military communications scheme involving an overall cost to the countries involved of $ 1,000m, can he say how much has been expended by Australia and the British and Canadian Governments who are partners in the project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONrt is true that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has indicated its intention to withdraw from the Mallard proposal which, without being too precise at question time, is a proposed communications system, [t is true that Australia is playing a very modest part in the scheme which, of course, has plenty of pluses for Australia because of the application of technology studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the serious disruption that Ls being caused to meatworks throughout Australia by the withdrawal of licences for exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in view of the particular effect of such withdrawal on works in northern Australia, which are almost solely dependent on the export market, will the Minister do all he can to ensure that uniform and continuing standards of hygiene requirements are drawn up with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that some countries have been banned completely from the meat market of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America because their abattoirs did not meet the required standards and because their inspection services were not of a sufficiently high standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> was enforcing a policy of federal registration of American abattoirs trading across the State border and, as a result of domestic pressures, was being forced to ensure that imported meat came only from the abattoirs which were of a standard at least equal to the federal requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The circumstances in which exemption will be allowable are to be prescribed by regulation, the intention being that they will parallel those in which exemption is currently available to <span class="highlight">United States</span> and British servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister say if standards set by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America authorities for hygiene and up-to-date slaughtering facilities have shown variations over the past several years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of new abattoirs being built - this is mooted in Tasmania - anywhere in Australia in accordance with the present conditions laid down by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, could the people responsible have any confidence that those standards would remain consistent and not be so changed as to negative their venture? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Senate again that all Australian meat works exporting to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are subject to periodic inspections by <span class="highlight">United States</span> veterinarians to see that they comply with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Meat Inspection Act and meat inspection regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt he has seen Press reports about a presidential panel advising President Nixon of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America that the call-up of youth in that country is costly, inequitable and divisive as a means of recruiting men for the armed forces, and introduces needless uncertainty into the lives of all young Americans? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, in every modern society - in West Germany, France, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or Australia - governments are forced to seek the bulk of their revenue from consumer taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities have applied conditions to the slaughtering and processing of beef that, in my view and in the view of many people in the industry, have been far beyond reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While in some quarters this has been interpreted as an attempt by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to limit meat supplies from Australia and thus protect producers in that country - and indeed there may be some justification for this interpretation - I think there is ample evidence to support the <span class="highlight">United States</span> action as a health precaution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in the situation where a successive number of Bills have been introduced for borrowings in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> related to credit arrangements with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills have authorised a part of the borrowings necessary to purchase equipment from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly dealt also with the wider issue of purchasing <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence equipment in this period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition opposes the Bill also because we consider that it is not necessary to purchase all of these items from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, a very important argument relating to these purchases is whether Australia should continue to bc so dependent upon <span class="highlight">United States</span> suppliers for this equipment much of which can be produced in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the position has not changed much since August 1969 when, as honourable senators may remember,  Mr Fairhall,  as he then was, tried to make this an issue in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> when he was visiting there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(4.7) - In reply - The Opposition has indicated that it will oppose the second reading of this Bill which seeks parliamentary approval for borrowings by the Commonwealth of up to $US125m for the purchase of defence equipment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate for defence loans is determined by the cost of money to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government at the time the loan is negotiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the head of my Department only recently returned from a visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and to Europe, and one of his prime functions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was to seek a flow back of offset orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In connection with the relative limits of liability under the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the proposed Australian legislation dealing with marine pollution, I am informed that the position is that the maximum liability in each case is on a par, to all intents and purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment all that we are doing by having a rate of interest 2 per cent or more higher than that prevailing in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is to create the situation such as that outlined by  Senator Wilkinson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also it is a continuation of the age long battle for superiority of the executive over Parliament or the Parliament over the executive, the lower house, the upper mass news media I see it is spoken of as being some new phenomenon, but if we look at the history of parliamentary government throughout the world - in the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and all other countries with parliamentary governments - there has always been a battle between Parliament and the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have borrowed something from each, here are, of course, many similarities between our Senate and the Senate of the United Slates of America, lt is rather interesting that in the very early days of discussions on the American system of government, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> founding fathers saw the need for Senate committees as a part of the game of checks and balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have examined in some detail the system of committees operating in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in some regards 1 think it works excellently but on many occasions the committees have been used as a means of holding back vital legislation that should have been passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great dangers that has arisen in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America with the committee system, which has functioned well in some fields, is that it has been used as a means of delaying for long periods action by the Congress on vital and important matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today in a country such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America it is possible to train a team of people to travel to the moon and to tramp upon it, but it seems that in our associations with other nations, through the United Nations, nothing practical has been done to rationalise this problem of lack of communication because of language barriers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The gist of my complaint was that after talking to both the ETU and  Mr Rudd  I was under the impression that the employer, after negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy, had been able lo get a 100 per cent increase on his original tender price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when the Minister peruses this letter from  Senator Kennedy  and the other one from the Assistant Secretary of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy he will agree with the view I expressed in my original letter to  Senator Kennedy  that the Australian employer was actually a free rider at the expense of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen reports that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> division of Proctor and Gamble, the international soap and detergent manufacturers, has decided to reduce the organic phosphate content of their detergent products, and that this action has been taken because of the polluting effects of phosphates in effluent waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In referring to the then Minister for Health perhaps 1 should have referred to the Department of Health, because I addressed my question to the Minister who was then representing the then Minister for Health, f ask: Was the then Minister unaware that British, <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian reports have all stressed the need to ban cigarette advertising on television? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am quite sure that my predecessor would have been aware that cigarette advertising on television has been banned in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> since the beginning of this year, in the United Kingdom for the last 5 years, and is also banned in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This review follows from the policy stated by the then Prime Minister in April 1970 when, in announcing the withdrawal of one Army battalion, he said that should the progress of pacification and Vietnamisation succeed as the  President  (of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>) hopes and believes that it will, then at some stage during the 12 months period we will consider phasing additional troops into the planned withdrawal’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is changing its course, and changing it rapidly, Australia apparently is unable to perform its manoeuvres sufficiently dextrously and is being made to look sheepish in the eyes of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A thaw is starting between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This dropping  of  the guard, collapse of the wall or the bamboo curtain - whatever fancy term may be preferred - could easily be influenced by the fact that the other great giant, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, is starting to move out of this zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the western world or, if you like, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, other countries and certainly our own country have refused to recognise Red China - or the People’s Republic of China - for the last 20 years Ls simply that before we exchange embassies or recogni- lion with another country three things have to be in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must bear- in mind, because of ‘ what has been said by various senators in this place from time to time about the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, that in the roundabout way in which international relations are sometimes conducted for at least 10 years the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been in almost constant consultation with the Warsaw Embassy of the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding what has .Been said, there has been a quite strong line of communication between the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Government in Peking, but there has been very little give by either side, one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on then to refer to the establishment of a strong bargaining position with the 2 super powers, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the USSR, and the rejection of their influence wherever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step is on the one hand to weaken proposed areas of support that some parts of the world would accord to the USSR, and on the other hand to weaken support from various countries who owe some allegiance or support to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: As far as the Australian Government is concerned, where is the change of attitude by China which has, for example, enabled us now to follow the lead of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and send a ping-pong team to China and engage in diplomatic relations of this sort? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia did not think of sending a ping-pong team to China before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> decided to send one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government sits down and listens to the newscasts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in order to find out what policy it will adopt with respect to the other nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that Australia was following the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, by sending a ping-pong team to China and that because a <span class="highlight">United States</span> ping-pong team went there we had to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not a case of Australia following the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 16th April he said that it was premature to anticipate any change in <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy of recognition or representation in the United Nations, and that that was very much in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China issued a clear warning to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that if American forces crossed the Yalu River and thus threatened China it would send its forces to North Korea, and it did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a very mild reaction compared to that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in such countries as Cuba in which there were no foreign forces at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cuba has no border with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, yet the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has said that it is entitled to decide the type of Government for Cuba. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not until November 1933 that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> under the late President Roosevelt recognised the Government of the Soviet Union as being the Government of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The foreign policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the 1920s was part and parcel of the same mentality which led to the Palmer raids and the red scares in that period inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government refused to recognise the Government of the Soviet Union as being the Government of Russia was not that it did not realise it was the Government but that it wanted to use the fear of Communism for domestic consumption to frighten people into voting for it when polling day came around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that the abattoir mentioned by the honourable senator was one of those de-listed late last year following an inspection by an American veterinarian because they were not up to the standard required by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for exports of meat to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate noted that a <span class="highlight">United States</span> presidential commission yesterday recommended that the People’s Republic of China be admitted to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Commission say that the admission of that government might be awkward and discordant but that there was more hope for peace in its interaction in the organisation than in its continued isolation from the United Nations and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it true that, although the Government has refused to make public the range of the Fill fighter-bomber, information was displayed publicly on a notice board at the Fairbairn Royal Australian Air Force base during the visit of <span class="highlight">United States</span> Fills that it is 3,150 miles with full bomb load? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether the former Prime Minister or the Government generally was aware that there was a possibility that Australian journalist Francis James would infiltrate the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Central Intelligence Agency to satisfy his own curiosity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Australian Government then responsible for leaking that information so that Green Beret methods would be used to eliminate Francis James, or alternatively, was the information supplied to agents of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Central Intelligence Agency in the People’s Republic of China in order to ensure that Francis James would be detained indefinitely in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Like so many acts of this Government, its action in introducing this Bill, as has been its whole behaviour in running a campaign on the question of law and order, has indicated a desire to imitate the less desirable features of life in the contemporary <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be remembered that during 1970  Mr Spiro  Agnew, the Vice-President of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and  Mr Reagan,  the Republican Governor of California, entered into an intensive campaign of law and order directed against the civil rights movement and against those people who were demonstrating in the streets against the continuation of the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> of America at the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vice-President Agnew was the star performer in the campaign for law and order and he campaigned very vigorously against people such as Adlai Stevenson III, a former Marine Corps officer who was the Democratic Party candidate for <span class="highlight">United States</span> senator from the State of Illinois; against  Mr Tunney,  the Democratic Party candidate for the Senate in California; and against many other eminent Americans who have been opposed to the Vietnam war and who have supported the civil rights movement in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of the law and order campaign in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was a repudiation of the policies which have become identified’ with the name of Vice-President Agnew, to such an extent that the Republican Party analysts have now concluded that, in those States where Agnew went with his law and order campaign, far from benefiting his own party he benefited the Democratic Party, so that even in the conservative State of Illinois the seat which had been held by the former Republican leader in the Senate,  Senator Dirksen,  was won by a liberal Democrat, the son of the former Democratic Party Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt all of these things should be preserved, but how different is that approach from the principles which are safeguarded in the Bill of Rights of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems that this Government imitates the politics of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> only when it wishes to be repressive and not when the opportunity exists to follow the great democratic principles enshrined in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the abnormally protracted negotiations between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments on the release of land on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour for park purposes’ be attributed to either the failure of the New South Wales Premier to reply promptly to a request from the former Prime Minister or the high selling price of the land that has been determined by the Commonwealth, which is in contrast with the practice followed by the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in its relations with the various States in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry been drawn to a paragraph in a leading article in an Australian newspaper of today’s date to the effect that there are justifiable fears in the minds of the Japanese Government and of exporters that any foothold they have established in a particular segment of the Australian market can be capriciously closed by Australian vested interests - often <span class="highlight">United States</span> or United Kingdom owned companies - and the closure justified on the spurious ground of balanced development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In part these arise from a lower than expected rate of expenditure under the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Credit Agreement and as a result of rephasing of and lags in both orders and deliveries of defence goods; and to agreed reductions in Commonwealth expenditure in response to the request of February 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that this is due to certain factors, the main ones being the unusual weather experienced in Queensland, the prohibition - now lifted - on mutton shipments to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, shipments of beef to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the lower level of stocks carried forward this year compared with last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only thing I can add is that in- answer to a question recently I pointed out that to increase the demand representatives of the trade in New Zealand, Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had decided to set- up a committee to, in effect, promote mutton by trade education and  consumer education in an effort to encourage the consumption of mutton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In doing this I would like to refer again to the judgment of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Black in the case of Gregory v. the City of Chicago which was heard in the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, first of all - this is what he referred to first in his judgment - that the First Amendment to the Constitution of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the Bill of Rights does guarantee freedom of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established the principle that freedom of assembly is guaranteed under the law of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the law then must look at what restrictions must be imposed upon freedom of assembly so that the undesirable consequences, such as those which were referred to in the part of  Mr Justice  Black’s judgment which were quoted by the Minister could not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of his judgment  Mr Justice  Black and other members of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but in particular  Mr Justice  Black, used the phrase ‘meat axe ordinance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, he wants to take issue with something which he believes I fairly said last night in regard to what  Mr Justice  Black said in the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He quoted him again in order to equate the provision which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America Supreme Court was considering with the provision which is before the Senate at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>American provisions and seeking to make some comparison with precise Australian provisions, but because  Senator Wheeldon  raised it let me indicate what that provision was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in Australia we have the idea that we are different to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada and that if we do reach the kind of situation that we have had in some instances the law is incapable of handling it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, because of the heavy influence of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Central Intelligence Agency no arrests were made amongst those who were provoking the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spent about 4 months in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and I would not like to have reared 4 sons to live in a community such as I saw there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to read very quickly an extract from a statement on the international air transportation policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which was approved by the  President  on 22nd June 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect I make the point that the comment made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  is more valid for a country like the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which has a huge aircraft manufacturing industry - I think an over capacity - and an airline industry which is in substantial over capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the private ownership of land upon which railways were built created tremendous problems and a great opportunity for individuals to cash in on public moneys spent in the development of railway systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made inquiries to determine whether this information was sufficient to make him acceptable for enlistment  in  the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Late in June - I am not sure of the date - he went to the office of the local Federal member and made a telephone call to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned, the final result was that he scored sufficiently well to qualify for entry into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  advice was to report for national service and, in so doing, show that he was willing to co-operate with the Australian Government and then, when he received word that he was accepted for enlistment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy, to arrange for a transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Private X said to the lass concerned that he would co-operate with the Australian Government, that he would present himself for national service and that he would apply for a transfer when proof of his enlistment qualifications came through from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He “received a telegram from Canberra by ordinary mail stating that his AQT was to be held in Canberra and that he should make arrangements to be tested at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Embassy in Canberra He showed the telegram to one of his superior officers and asked whether he could take his 4-day stand-down -in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 3rd September 1970, which is only a few weeks after he had actually been inducted he received a letter from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy Recruiting Detachment at Sangley Point stating that he had made a qualifying score in his AQT test but that he had to make his own way to Sangley Point to be enlisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Broadly, the effect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station (Civilian Employees) Act 1968 is to extend to civilian employees employed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy in connection with the station the terms of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act as if they were employees of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also gives to these employees, or to another person, in the event of an injury or disease causing the death of such an employee, the right to recover damages at common law from the Commonwealth, and again as if the Commonwealth were the employer, in the event of damage arising from injury, disease or death suffered directly as a result of employment with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy, subject, of course, to the usual requirements concerning negligence being met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is, firstly, to make amendments to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station (Civilian Employees) Act 1968, which in Part II of the Bill is referred to as the principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Bill provides, in Part III, consequent upon the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1971, for the application of the provisions of that Bill to certain civilian employees of the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America employed in connection with the station, whether within or outside the territorial limits of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment to section 3 of the principal Act will make clear that persons employed by an instrumentality of the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in this instance, the Navy Exchange, whom it was always intended should be covered by the Act, are civilian employees - within the restricted meaning that that term has in this context - for purposes of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other amendments to the principal Act will enable the principal Act to be applied to civilian employees who are employed, either within or outside the territorial limits of Australia, by the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in connection with the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the principal Act was being prepared it was not clear whether any civilian employees of the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be employed outside the territorial limits of Australia and the application of the Act was limited accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Association, which was formed on the initiative of the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, is to provide loans to developing countries which are not in a position to borrow money on the world market at the normal rates of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They depend on money which is made available by wealthier nations such as Australia, and more particularly, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, to allow them to bridge the gap between their capacity and what they would like to do and, I am sure, what we would all like them to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, out of a total of SUS2,428m, is asked to produce $US960m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first amount that I mentioned is to be borrowed from the Export-Import Bank and the amount of $US30m will be borrowed from a number of banks in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, including the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York] The purpose of borrowing this money, is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be of interest to note that in the 11 years prior to 1968 the Commonwealth has been the borrower of approximately $US289m from the various banks in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in order that aircraft could be bought by Qantas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the most remarkable thing is - and I have never blamed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for protecting itself - that the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, on behalf of Boeing, has said: ‘There may be some mechanism in these planes which we believe other countries have not got and which we want to see they do not get.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  said that the purpose of this Bill is for the Parliament to approve borrowings by the Commonwealth of $A26.4m from the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Boeing Company, and $A26.8m from a syndicate of <span class="highlight">United States</span> commercial banks led by the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York to assist in financing the purchase of 4 Boeing 747 aircraft and related equipment, spares and services estimated to cost $A125m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is the tenth or eleventh occasion on which parliamentary approval has been sought by the Government for a borrowing by the Commonwealth in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on behalf of Qantas Airways Limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Qantas has an option for 6 of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> supersonics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the page headed ‘International Agreements’ where it states that Qantas carried some 700,000 passengers last year compared with 14 million on <span class="highlight">United States</span> international airlines, 9 million on United Kingdom airlines, 5 million on French airlines and 3 million each on the Canadian, German, Swiss and Italian airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I referred to the answers given by the Minister recently relating to charter flights generally and the application made to the Minister by World Airways Inc. in connection with charter flights between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the application of World Airways Inc. is based on the proposal for15 charter flights into Australia which would not detrimentally affect existing services of Qantas Airways Ltd to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost all internation airlines, with some exceptions and apart from the countries behind the Iron Curtain, are flying substantially the same limited types of aircraft - Boeings, perhaps Douglases and some other British planes - the great bulk of which are manufactured in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>8m is to be borrowed from a syndicate of <span class="highlight">United States</span> commercial banks, with which the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York is associated, and the $2 6.4m is to be borrowed from the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> under loan agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be well advised to pay some attention to this because even if the Government is not resenting the fact that these provisions are contained in Bills, the Opposition is, not only in this chamber but also in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wants to produce a relationship which will be conducive to proper and continued fair dealing between the countries it should pay some attention to seeing to it that these provisions which are resented and which the Opposition regards as an indignity, are taken out of these Bills and agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has some Act of Congress which says it has to be done in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wants to do business with us, and it does because it wants to sell its aircraft and we want to buy the aircraft, it should give consideration to taking these provisions out of the arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wants to continue selling goods to us and to continue lending money as a means of facilitating sales - it does let there be no doubt about it - these provisions should come out of the agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that I do not think this is a very satisfactory way, from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to be dealing with us, and the sooner the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wakes up to it the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a lot better if that is what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be very difficult to see how the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could have a treaty obligation, except with us, that would affect us in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government says there is some such thing let it tell us, but I find it difficult to conceive that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could enter into a treaty with somebody else which would affect its relations with us in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not be put in the position of a subordinate or second rate country in dealing with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, there is a certain national dignity to be maintained and if year after year the <span class="highlight">United States</span> persists, through its agency, in offending that national dignity by insisting that as a condition of borrowing some money from it - which we will be paying back after all - we have to enter into terms which some of us here consider to be degrading, it is going to affect our future relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that not only the Treasury but also the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities will take that into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities ought to understand, and our Treasury ought to make them understand, that resentment is arising in Australia because of these clauses in the agreement which have no real purpose but are degrading to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is necessary to include them because of <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should consider that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is reasonable that in view of our comity with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the American Government ought to be put on notice that clauses are being included in agreements which are certainly offensive to a considerable number of members of the Australian Parliament, on no other ground than that they are inconsistent with the dignity of this country and are degrading to our sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take this theme to its logical conclusion we would have to consider the history of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> over the last 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope I do not upset the decorum of the Senate by saying that I remember reading that on one memorable occasion when the creation of a massive bureau in Washington was being discussed, Harry Truman, the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, who was a very earthy man, listened to what was said for a while and then said: ‘That agency will be about as much use as the male nipple’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it true that so far Australia has paid $228m to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America as a deposit on the 24 Fill fighter bombers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to this matter last week in answer to a question by  Senator Bishop  when I explained that I would be sending officers to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to make inquiries concerning the progress towards meeting our operational technical requirements as laid down under the Laird-Fraser agreement in May of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact’ that a serious difference has arisen between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australian governments over the supply of agricultural machinery by Australia to Cuba? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government indicated that it will take action to deter further exports of such goods by Australia to Cuba? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While it may be true that Japan spends only 1 per cent of its gross national product on defence, as the Prime Minister announced in the House of Representatives, is the Government aware that substantial contributions to the re-arming of Japan have been made by the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America since the end of World War II? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate of the total amount of <span class="highlight">United States</span> contributions to Japanese rearmament since the end of World War II? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has made substantial contributions to the Japanese economy, as well as to the defence of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the amount of <span class="highlight">United States</span> contributions for the purpose referred to by  Senator O’Byrne,  he would not expect me to have that knowledge without reference to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the terms relating to the use of the FI 1 1 aircraft have yet to be negotiated, will the Minister see to what extent the servicing and overhaul specifications and the work which has now apparently been sent to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America might be let out to Australian manufacturers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the presidential governmental system a Secretary of State, say, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, is required to administer his department and perform other duties of that character whereas under the Westminster system the same gentleman is required to represent an electorate - or a State if he is a senator - to run his department, to appear in the House and answer questions, to present legislation for his department and to present, defend and explain the estimates for his department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the Constitution of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, whereby an attempt was made to separate the power of the executive and the power of the Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is prepared to enter into negotiations with other world producers and consumers of tin to fix the price at which that commodity shall bc sold on the world market but then reserves to herself the right to stand outside the agreement, which she is capable of influencing, and to buy tin on the world market at prices less than the international agreement price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the terms relating to the use of the F111 aircraft have yet to be negotiated, will the Minister see to what extent the servicing and overhaul specifications and the work which has now apparently been sent to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America might be let out to Australian manufacturers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To illustrate the point I am making, I should like to include in the record a list which shows some of the matters under the administration of various departments in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard an extract from a publication produced by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of the Interior called ‘Assistance for Outdoor Recreation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, there have been 18 crashes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has fitted too neatly into the defence concepts established by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is evident that he and his specialist groups that travel to and from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have been very careful and are not satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to our commitments with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to purchase the F111 aircraft and our arrangements to lease Phantom aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> 18 F111 aircraft have crashed and this has occasioned our specialists to give definite consideration to whether the order should be cancelled, as a result of which Australia would stand to lose a great deal of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to us that in relation to aircraft acquired from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the Government and the Minister could say: ‘Well, we have sent special teams to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to see to what extent we could get offset orders’, but the fact is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider, the magnitude of the expenditure, totalling about $500m, on importing aircraft from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, we realise that Australia is getting only small bundles of orders to a total value of $4m or SSm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further statement was made on 25th October 1966 by Secretary Hicks of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government when the Australian Government was attempting to alter the arrangements which had been entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there is also evidence of a wide disparity between the estimates of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities and our own Australian advisers as to the comparative costs involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>According to the same report the cost of the 24 aircraft estimated by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force as at April 1967 was $237.7m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reminded the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government of our acute dissatisfaction in Australia with the project, and said that Australia did not consider that our order of 24 aircraft created a joint project in any real sense; that, on the contrary, this was essentially a <span class="highlight">United States</span> project . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Malcolm  Fraser said that in regard to this highly technical area he did not learn anything in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America - and now I quote him - ‘which, to my mind, casts doubt on the expert advice given to me . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the United Kingdom Government years ago cancelled its contract and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy also cancelled its contract, the Australian Government has not had the courage to face up to the fact that eventually it will have to decide to do the same thing or, alternatively, if we ever get the aircraft, find ourselves involved more and more deeply in further expenditure on the aircraft and probably the supply of tankers as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that last year the then Minister for Defence, together with officers of my Department, went to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and spoke with the Minister for Defence in that country,  Mr Laird,  before coming back here with what is now called the Fraser-Laird minute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The chief technical officer of the Department of Air has gone to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to determine exactly What is the situation at the present time in regard to these technical fatigue tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another factor is that in Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America lighter fibres have become more fashionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that time there were swept away from the Scottish Highlands, the Irish lands and the Welsh hills, thousands of people who eventually found their way to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada or Australia and sought to reestablish themselves on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This happened in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where a whole generation was driven off the land after the 1914-18 war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have a new situation in regard to the American-Australian-Cuban situation relating to the supply of farm machinery in that the South American republics which are members of the Organisation of American States are pressing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the circumstances for the rescission - or apparently that is expected - of the Australian sugar quota on the American market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister any intention of replying to the loud-mouthed Yanks, both <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government spokemen and the Press, who have been very vocal against Australia in  so  many fields over the past week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he inform them that in addition to our troops in Vietnam, without foreign or Marshall aid the balance of trade between our two countries has favoured the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by over $2,400m during the past 5i years - this excluding the Fill transaction and the huge profits made by American companies investing in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator may take it that in matters of trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or with any other country Australia prosecutes its natural self interest to the best of its ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly true that the trade situation with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has, through the years, improved progressively in favour of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and therefore Australia ought to have increased trading opportunity in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for many things that we produce and that we think people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should have a chance to buy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister for Civil Aviation refers to previous answers by the Minister and further publicity about an application by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> charter operator, World Airways, for 15 charter nights to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact, as the Minister said in reply, that the application was for control by World Airways of the charter services to and from Australia, or was there an agreement or a proposal that consideration would be given to 15 reciprocal charter flights from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister is aware of a recent announcement made by  Dr Linus  Pauling, the eminent <span class="highlight">United States</span> scientist, twice winner of the Nobel prize for his work, to the effect that a copious intake of vitamin C will act as a preventive shield against the common cold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister taken steps to inform the American senators and the American Government of this fact, particularly as there could be great damage to the sugar industry of Queensland if the quota of sugar supplied to America is cut or eliminated because of the stand by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is indeed serious, as I indicated in a question I directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  this morning, that large blocks of the equity holdings of finance companies which are attracting overseas, investment should be in the hands of banks in Hong Kong, <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Great Britain and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator mentioned many countries, including those in most parts of Europe as well as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in which legislation of this type has existed for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not, perhaps, by accident that legislation of this character comes to this country many years after similar legislation has been in effect in other countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Great Britain and certain continental countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which I suppose must be regarded as the home of free enterprise, the practice under the old Sherman Act - I call it that for lack of a better title at the moment - was that where a company had 35 per cent of the market it was not allowed to fix its resale price maintenance figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is evident, though, from reading an article from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which appeared in this morning’s Press that this is, as one suspected earlier, to some extent tied up with the general position of Australia in negotiating for a higher sugar quota in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One could probably argue about transportation to the State of Florida from other major regions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, but the fact of the matter is that the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America,  President  Nixon, vetoed the whole project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As most acrylic tow is imported from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and is duty free, whilst the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has a duty of 25 ic per lb on wool, will the Government give consideration to the imposition of protective duty against this strong competitor of our wool? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has since discussed the matter with the Embassy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to change to the metric system was made in recognition of the considerable benefits which will follow the change, that it was in any case inevitable having regard to the world situation in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is now the only non-metric country, not committed to the change, and that the longer it is delayed the greater will be the costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-105-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador in Taiwan has publicly predicted that Taiwan’s international trade volume may be equal ‘ to or in excess of that of Mainland China in 2 or 3 years’ time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that die <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador to the Republic of China said, when addressing the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, that the Republic of China’s total trade volume may be equal to, or larger than, that of the People’s Republic of China within 2 or 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that he also referred to the production of synthetic meats in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which is a very large market for Australian meats, and said that already General Foods and Dupont were making synthetic meat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I press him to do so, especially in the light of changing circumstances in Vietnam and the fact that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> system the man responsible for the dreadful massacres at My Lai is still not in prison, whereas 2 young men who have refused to be involved in that dreadful war are languishing in an Australian prison? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its purpose was to help, jointly with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and others, to sustain and develop the confidence of the government and the people of the Republic; to help defend it; to develop its capacities to deal with both overt aggression and externally promoted insurgency; and to enable it to make its own decisions about its future in a context of greater security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has for some time been our policy to withdraw our forces progressively as and when in our judgment, and after consultation with the Republic of Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the situation has allowed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that these elements will continue to work in close association with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> effort in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, we see changes in the defence posture of our close allies, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, if one examines the position in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> one finds that there is even less representation involved in the government of Washington in the District of Columbia than there is in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-85-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Agreements were made in 1954, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, although not a signatory to the Agreements, indicated quite clearly through its then Secretary .of  State,  Mr Foster  Dulles, that k ‘ would support and carry out the terms of the Geneva Agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That government refused to carry OUt the terms of the Agreements, and it was only when it became obvious that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the puppets of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were not carrying out the terms of the Geneva Agreements that the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam engaged in armed activity in order to see that the people of Vietnam would be able to conduct their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ANZUS Treaty, which refers only to aggression against one of the three member countries - Australia, New Zealand and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - obviously has nothing to do with the form of government in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The argument went that if we would send troops to Vietnam because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had troops there, somehow or other in days to come the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government would remember what we had done for it and at great inconvenience to itself it would get into difficulties, and give American lives and arms and American wealth in order to save Australia from some aggressor because of what we had done in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">United States</span> decided to reduce Australian meat imports into that country, did anybody say that that action should not be taken because Australia had 8,000 troops in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Nixon, the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> himself, is to go off to China, his arrangements made for him by none other than  Dr Kissinger,  regarded as probably the most eminent - or, if ‘eminent’ is not the word, the most persuasive and well-informed - adviser to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>previous tack he would have no alternative but to describe  President  Nixon as the Manchurian  President,  and to say that  President  Nixon had sold out Australia or had sold out the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> decided that it was in the interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to talk turkey with the Chinese, and if the Australians did not like it, it was too bad for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> would come to the support of Australia if it became involved in conflict with another power, if it thought it were in the interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Air and refers to a report which came from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America early last July regarding modifications to the Phantom F4E aircraft and the Minister’s statement that some examination was being made of this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> 1 also found a concern for the future of world trade related to the policies of the EEC both in protection for agriculture and the spread of new preferential agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other particular concern in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is with the protective policies of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reflect the continuing problems which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been experiencing in its balance of payments which have led to the serious measures which were announced by the  President  this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures, on the trade side, included the imposition cf a temporary import levy of 10 per cent on about half of <span class="highlight">United States</span> imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Happily for Australia, some of our major exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - beef, sugar, alumina, beach sands, totalling about 70 per cent of our exports are exempt from the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the measures will have a marked effect on the trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of other countries such as Japan, and Australia’s exports of raw materials which are processed in Japan for re-export to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could he affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one pleasing feature of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> measures is that they have been clearly announced as temporary, to be removed when the causes of the current problems disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had been feared that the rising protectionist sentiment in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which arose because of the pressures on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> trade balance, might result in the erection of permanent barriers to trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the War the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been a leader in all the moves towards freer trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, until the immediate and pressing problems are overcome the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration would not be prepared to Undertake to seek from Congress a mandate for such a major international move, Indeed, the climate in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is such that it would be difficult for any Bill designed to free trade to succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> 1 explored the possibility of reopening the question of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wool duty which has so long been a thorn in the side of our own trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I received a sympathetic hearing on the difficulties of the Australian wool industry and on the importance for us of some movement in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wool duty, I was given clearly to understand that in the current circumstances there was no prospect of legislative action designed to open the way for an agreement leading to the reduction of the wool duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, if we can sell over SI 20m worth of manufactures on a straight competitive basis in a vast manufacturing country like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - as we did in 1969-70- and nearly S800m to all world markets, we should not be pessimistic about our ability to be competitive also in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second, which has caused legislation to be introduced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, is the right of the employee as against the employer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that this is a matter which has caused people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to give special consideration to what are the relative rights of the employer and the employee in that type of situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today I have had no answer as to why acrylic fibres are brought from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and admitted to Australia duty free whereas the <span class="highlight">United States</span> charges a duty of 25 per cent on our natural product of wool.I think the Government should take positive steps to equalise the situation, or at least to ensure that if synthetic fibres are to enter this country they should not do so completely free of duty when exported by the country that is charging such a vicious rate of duty on the natural fibre produced here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that he said was that we are losing sight of the fact that the moves being made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in financial circles are likely to have more far reaching effects on our economy than the Government realised when it was drawing up the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister seriously believe that in the face of Australian employer organisations’ bleats on rising costs they would have a bar of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> system now advanced by the Dental Association in which employers underwrite their employees’ dental costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Will he also draw that Minister’s attention to an article in this month’s edition of Aircraft’ which states that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy has taken delivery from Litton Industries of the first of 8 Omega transmitters which are to be installed in 8 named countries including Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he ascertain from the Minister on what grounds the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy assumes that a transmitter will be installed somewhere in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preferred, and hoped-for locations for the 8 stations, as given in the ‘Aircraft’ report, are the same as listed in numerous public statements made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities from the outset of their Omega planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authority implementing the Omega project has elected not to await confirmation of all proposed participants before proceeding with equipment procurement The latter action could not be said to imply agreement on any or all of the locations at which the equipment might be installed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was advanced to this Commission that the experience of Australia was all against the elimination of conscription, that Australia had been forced to rely on a conscript army and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should do the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some have cited the Australian decision to return to a draft as evidence that an all-volunteer force is not feasible for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> There are several’ reasons why this argument by analogy is inappropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that throughout this period the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was applying considerable pressure on the Australian Government to send more forces to Vietnam to provide a facade of respectability to the American claim that what it was doing in Vietnam was saving the free world from the Communist hordes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether it is a fact that recently the Australian Government complained to the Government of the United Slates of America about the failure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration to keep Australia properly informed on important matters of joint concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will recent restrictions imposed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on its currency result in any loss or restriction of the export market for Australian canned tropical fruits and fruit juices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Industry has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:  it is assumed that the question refers to the import surcharge which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> recently introduced on specified imports entering the United Slates market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were no exports of tropical tanned fruit juices from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect the United Statesmeasures will have on our exports of canned tropical fruit to that market are not yet clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The import surcharge does not apply to canned fruit produced within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and unless the surcharge is absorbed by exporters or distributors, imported canned fruit will now be more expensive to consumers than domestically produced fruit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of the surcharge is also, of course, compounded by the change in parity of the Australian dollar relative to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he inform the Senate of any  likely effect on Australian exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, especially meat which has to be got in almost immediately to fill this year’s quota? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regarding that part of the honourable senator’s question which concerned importations of meat,  I  understand that some meat is still entering the west coast of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> via Canadian ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second matter negotiated was not really an agreement as much as a final declaration - an unsigned declaration - of the Geneva Conference, the parties to which were representatives of Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, Laos, the People’s Republic of China, the State of Vietnam - I point out to honourable senators that South Vietnam was not recognised in the declaration - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad that  Senator Mulvihill  has mentioned the socialist leader of Singapore because the socialist leader of Singapore has nothing but contempt for the views of the socialist party of Australia, as is evidenced by the fact that he has supported to the hilt the commitment in Vietnam of both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia, and is on record as having said that Singapore knows, as do the other countries in South East Asia, that if Vietnam falls to the communists all the little fishes of Asia will fall as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, I would have hoped - although 1 am quite sure my hopes would have been dashed - that  Senator Greenwood,  who takes a lively interest in conscripting people to fight in wars which he supports, would have known that there is a very substantial body amongst the Catholic clergy and laity in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America who argue for precisely the proposition submitted by the Labor Party in the amendment moved by  Senator James  McClelland - that there should be provision for conscientious objection on the ground that the proposed conscript believes that the war is unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at such important American Catholic theological journals as ‘The Commonweal’, published by the Society of Jesus, one finds that this is a doctrine which has been put forward consistently for the past 5 or 6 years by this very eminent organ of responsible Catholic opinion in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have noticed in the Press in the last few days that an offer has been made by, I think, a <span class="highlight">United States</span> based shipping organisation, to carry the coming season’s crop overseas at the now existing shipping freight rates, despite the threat of those who are now carrying this cargo to increase shipping freight rates by 24 per cent or thereabouts which will then make the cost of shipping a case or carton of fruit from this country something in the vicinity of $3.10. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is acknowledged that that scheme has its limitations, but it is the basis of structuring the continuance of a sound export market not only to Europe but also to Asian markets such as Singapore and Malaysia and to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Japan if only we can penetrate the Japanese market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told that opposed to these commissars was our great and powerful ally, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, steadfastly determined to oppose Communism and to support democracy even if supporting democracy meant sending troops into the Dominican Republic to depose  a  democratically elected president. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we were faced with this menace, but we were allied with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America steadfastly opposed to Communism - a country which would never talk to Chou En-lai or Mao Tsetung; a country which would never recognise Communist China; a country which, with every fibre of its being, would oppose the admission of Communist China to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case whether or not the dominoes were falling over and whether or not the war was a good thing, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was sending troops there and if we sent our troops there with theirs the United Slates would look after us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt has been said that if we make these sacrifices now, America, being a just nation, will keep a sort of ledger in which it will have black entries and red entries and we will be scoring up some credits, and at some time in the future when we are in a spot of bother the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will come to our assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a country of similar ethnic and cultural origins to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, a country which provided the earliest white settlers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, a country which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and which, up to the time about which I am speaking, was also a member of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> did this because it believed that, whatever the Netherlands had done for it in the past and whatever the Republic of Indonesia had done against it in the past, the best interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were served by recognising the Indonesian claim to Netherlands New Guinea and repudiating the Dutch claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Australia becomes involved in some military conflict and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America believes that it is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to come to Australia’s assistance it will do so whether Australia had done anything for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although overall our meat exports for 1970-71 were about the same as for the previous year we know that our exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were down a certain percentage, particularly in the case of mutton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The importance to Australia of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America market can be seen by the fact that some $209m was spent by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the importation of beef from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great developments which have occurred within the last few years in research has been prominent in the minds of those people who have noted the problem which the abattoirs have had in so many areas of Australia and the actions which the inspectors from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have taken and the criticism they have made of the quality of the meat which has left Australia and the quality of the abattoirs which have handled that meat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most important investigation insofar as exports are concerned is in relation to cysticercosis, which is the greatest single cause of the rejection of Australian frozen boneless mutton by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market and which is to Australia a very severe economic problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears in, amongst other animals, goats, sheep, cattle, water buffalo, pigs, yaks in Mongolia, reindeer and caribou, and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America a form of brucellosis has been identified in dogs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister for Air  (Senator Drake-Brockman)  that by way of question I indicated that among the many threats to the export of beef from this country to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America there was the added threat of brucellosis, because the information coming from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> indicates that brucellosis is almost completely under control there and Australia could face an added restriction by the American health authorities against the export of our meat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is very important to press the point that moneys raised under this Bill should be directed towards, and emphasis and priority should be given to, the control of brucellosis in this country because limitations could be imposed on the export of our meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that the fall in the shipments of mutton to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in 1970-71 compared with 1969-70 was a direct result of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ban on mutton from Australia which was imposed in the middle of 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now in the forefront in the thought processes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vote having been taken, the immediate <span class="highlight">United States</span> response was reflected in the decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate which passed, by an overwhelming majority, a resolution that there should be no more foreign aid provided by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there was to be an immediate acceleration of the process of retraction and of withdrawal by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> from involvement in the affairs of other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only this morning on the radio I heard an interview with  Senator McGovern,  who is a possible Democratic Party nominee for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> presidential election next year, in which he advocated that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> withdraw from the ANZUS Pact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That very dramatic statement highlights the fact that, quite apart from the control of America in Republican hands, in the hands of  Senator McGovern  as  President,  backed by his Party, there would be an American retraction to the extent that he would contemplate the dissociation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> even from an existing treaty such as ANZUS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These processes on the part of Britain and of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are highlighting one emerging fact in the disposition of world power, particularly as it affects Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That disposition is that as Britain withdraws west of Suez and withdraws more and more into an introverted Europe and as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, for reasons good and sufficient to itself, withdraws into a quasi-Monroe doctrine, Australia will be faced with a new, emerging and dangerous isolationism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable senators that the closest the world came to major war since the Second World War - we were on the very threshold of it - was during the confrontation between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Soviet Union over Cuba. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no suggestion of the physical invasion of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that was required was that within a measurable target distance of the mainland of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there should be an accommodating power that could provide a launching base for missiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that position had been established,  President  Kennedy found it necessary to deploy the American fleet and to bring his nation and the world to the brink of a major war because that position in itself was a lethal threat to the security and continuance of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators of the action of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government when it found that nuclear weapons were in Cuba, so close to its shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are withdrawing, but if confrontation of these great powers should occur in this part of the world, and it seems to be a real strategic possibility, Australia will find herself in the very eye of the cyclone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know, but you are implying that Europe will tend to adopt a Monroe Doctrine concept and I do not believe that it will, lt will be a task for Australian diplomacy in the broadest meaning of the word to encourage Britain to see that this does not happen, and to suggest that other big trading countries of the world such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan should work towards the same objective and will not become - and I believe this to be so - introverted or inward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not name all of those 34 nations, but those which have special significance for us included the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the countries of the 34 that I wish to name are the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other substantive resolution, known as the dual representation draft resolution, was co-sponsored by 18 member states including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that power is in the hands also of other permanent members including our close friends, Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Out of the 35 countries which voted against the Albanian proposition 12 - over a third - were South American client states of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is - and I think that almost all of us would recognise it today - that neither our membership of the United Nations, nor our membership of the Commonwealth, nor our natural relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, has provided us with that leverage in world affairs for which the instinct of this House continues to ask. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of the United Kingdom decision is that we now see being created in Europe a huge world ‘force, a new super power - indeed, it might be said, a power capable of exercising enormous economic, political and, if need be, military power in the world, lt will be a power equal to, if not greater than, that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, of the Soviet Union, of the People’s Republic China, if it seeks to be a super power, and of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is o longer able to exercise a major influence in the world, but there will be with the United Kingdom, Denmark and other countries as part of Europe a community of 255 million people - a population far greater than that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 20th January 1969 the Leader of the DLP forwarded a message to  President  Richard Nixon on his elevation to the Presidency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assumption by Australia of some responsibility for the defence of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand; strengthened defence capability to make that possible; active Australian diplomacy for regional co-operation to provide the framework for collective self-defence; expanded Australian aid to Indonesia; trade opportunities for Malaysia and Singapore; and a trade agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to end our squabbling over meat and wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cast our minds back to the beginning of the matter of urgency where it refers to Australian defence and security implications, and refer to the remarks made by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the Prime Minister a couple of days ago, I suggest that that is a reasonably fair defence and security implication which should be read by everybody who is interested in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, it should be noted that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has security treaties with Japan, the Philippines and the Republic of China, in addition to the ANZUS Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1959-60 we exported 8.1 per cent of our exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1959-60 we imported 16.2 per cent of our imports from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Predictions indicate that by 2000 Japan could well be a bigger country economically in total terms than the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He faced the fact that the immediate reaction in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was to return to a policy of isolationism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am no historical genius but I see every indication of a return by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the isolationism that has been her attitude for most of her history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little spoke about isolationism in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a few days ago I read an article describing a mounting campaign in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to withdraw or at at ‘.east to reduce drastically the <span class="highlight">United States</span> forces that are stationed in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> sinks more and more into isolationism and withdraws its forces or part of them from or substantially reduces them in Europe, it does seem reasonable to think that this action might speed up the further federation of the countries that comprise the European Economic Community into a real, virile defence unit as a counterpoise to the influence further east of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom are 2 countries with which Australia has had most adverse trading balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Belatedly, Government supporters came here today and accepted the position, as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite admit that this could be a good thing for the world, just as the arrangement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that many world crises have been avoided because of the understanding - I admit there have been some misunderstandings - between the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has realistically accepted the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that as far back as 1955 the Chinese tried to reach an agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of <span class="highlight">United States</span> commitments in the area the approach was dropped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion that in a short time - 5 to 10 years - Taipeh will make the same sort of accommodation with China as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that because we can walk with our head high in South East Asia, because we can talk to the peoples of western Europe, because we can talk to the people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and because we are developing links with Japan we can be a political placenta for the exchange of ideas and, therefore, we can be a great factor towards peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>President Nixon’s statement on various new economic measures the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was taking was made on 15th August last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly stated, the  President  announced the following main measures: Convertibility of <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars into gold and other reserve assets was to be temporarily suspended; a 10 per cent surcharge on all dutiable imports into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, other than those subject to quotas, was to be imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  announced certain other measures the main effects of which were designed to stimulate the growth of output in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> while at the same time attempting to restrain wage and price increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these measures however - the job development tax credit - also has the effect of discriminating against imports into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of various manufactured products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In international terms the significant element of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> action - apart from the suspension of convertibility of the dollar, the consequence of which I will come to later - was ‘.he 10 per cent surcharge on imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many factors which contributed to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ balance of payments crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one thing, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which had once been an example to the world in maintaining cost and price stability, found itself in a position where, for some time, its prices and costs had been rising more rapidly than those of its main competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has claimed thai some of its troubles have been due to the fact that it has been shouldering an undue share of the free world’s defence burdens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defence expenditures abroad by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have recently been running at around SUS5 billion annually Australia is probably in as good a position as any country to appreciate the size of the defence expenditures the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been assuming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then again, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has claimed that its trading position has been worsened by what it regards as the unfair practices pursued by some of its trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is facing a deficit on its trade account this year for the first time for almost 80 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is a good thing that a country as powerful as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is prepared to take up seriously this matter of unfair trading practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that context, incidentally, I certainly took the opportunity of pointing out the barriers that exist to many of our own exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind all these circumstances, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has taken the view that a number of its trading partners were conducting their trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the basis of exchange rates which gave them an unfair advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has called foi a major realignment of exchange parities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This realignment would recognise the over-valuation ot the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar, or the under-valuation of the currencies of those countries in balance of payments surplusthe way of expressing it depends upon the point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has recognised that this dollar crisis is only the last of a series of crises which have affected in turn the pound sterling, the French franc, the German deutschemark, and now the United Slates dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And when they did open, parities with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar were not maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The currencies of most major trading countries floated upwards against the dollar until today the deutschemark is almost 10 per cent up on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar, lite yen about 9 pei cent, the Netherlands guilder 8 per cent, the Belgian financial frac 7 per cent and sterling 4 pet cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meanwhile, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and its major trading partners are still debating bilaterally, and within other forums, notably the Group of Ten, what further contribution to the restoration of equilibrium in international trade and payments is still required by the United Slates, on the one hand, and by the rest of the Group of Ten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, however, has not had things all its own way on these non-financial issues and criticism is mounting not only against the import surcharge, but also against some related measures such as the application of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> job development tax credit which has the effect of discriminating against imports of capital equipment into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the basic question of the magnitude of the balance of payments turnaround which needs to be achieved between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the rest of the Group of Ten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has made no secret of the fact that it seeks a total turnaround of the order of $13 billion per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, one reason which is reported to figure prominently in the argument between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the other members of the Group of Ten is that the latter, particularly some of them, seriously question the need on their part to worsen their balances of payments on current account in order, among other things, to provide the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with a sufficient surplus to enable it to maintain a high level of net capital investment abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However that may be, what is clear is that even if trade and defence issues are left aside, the attitude of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> appears to be that the realignment has not yet gone far enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is an important trading partner of the Europeans, but not all-important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest of the Group of Ten, for their part, have said in voices of varying strength, that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is seeking a more substantial realignment, it should be making a contribution itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this they mean that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should itself devalue in terms of gold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that point of view the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar can just as much be said to have floated downwards against most major currencies as those currencies can be said to have floated upwards against the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another^ and more far-reaching, aspect of this matter is its significance for the role of gold in the monetary system in the future; and in that context also the Managing Director of the Fund,  Mr Schweitzer,  has made the valid point that any outcome to the present impasse which did not involve gold in at least maintaining its value relative to the average appreciation of other currencies against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar would not only affect the future of gold but also the future of Special Drawing Rights which are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice it to say that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at this point of time asserts that an increase in the dollar price of gold is not acceptable to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One problem is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is an enormous economy in which, in relative terms, international trade does not loom so large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exports as a proportion of <span class="highlight">United States</span> Gross National Product are only some 5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is obviously under less pressure, from a purely economic viewpoint, in arriving at an outcome which it would regard as giving it a satisfactory contribution from the surplus countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And there are some individual countries in turn for whom trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is not so important - for example, only some 5 per cent of France’s trade is with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great risk in all this, however, is that as the import surcharge and other measures taken by the United Staes begin to bite - as exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and employment in export industries begins to fall away - the countries affected could well become less and less willing, and perhaps less and less able, to make the further contributions which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> expects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment is running in the region of about 6 per cent in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, about 7 per cent in Canada, and over 31 per cent in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, I have made it clear that we are not taking sides, as between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the one hand and the other members of the Group of Ten on the other, on the issue of whether or not the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should effect a minor devaluation in terms of gold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> docs achieve the turnaround in its balance of payments necessary to correct its deficit, it is by no means unlikely that the status of the US dollar as a reserve asset will be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a country which has traditionally held a large pa/1 of its reserves in the form of foreign exchange, with consequent benefit to our balance of payments, what we say is that any such action, il indeed it is needed once the <span class="highlight">United States</span> achieves balance again, must be acceptable to the existing holders of foreign balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discussion between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the rest of the Group of Ten is to continue in Paris next month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the Australian dollar has appreciated by about 4 per cent in terms of parity with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, other countries, some of them important trading partners of Australia, have appreciated even more against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, this means that the agreement cannot become effective unless and until it is ratified by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> administration had commenced proceedings to have Congress pass the necessary legislation to authorise payment of the subscription and contribution totalling $US960m for that country, action on this matter had not then been completed and indeed still remains outstanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister was for the purpose of establishing why this substance was being admitted into Australia from Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America duty free when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> imposed a 25c duty, T think it is, on every pound of our wool going into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 should like to see the Government initiate action to search out every possible avenue, at least in our internal markets over which we have control, to increase the demand for the Australian grown product which is competing with the chemically produced product which is imported from, among other countries, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These practices include collusive tendering, which embraces horizontal agreements; blacklisting or boycotting; tying of contracts, such as export franchises which stipulate that a company can export only to certain countries so as to preserve a market serviced profitably by overseas sections of a multi-national corporation; and interlocking directorates which are outlawed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I accept the way in which  Senator Murphy  puts it because when he was speaking 1 thought that one of the interesting features of the Canadian Competition Bill is that it repeals pre-existing legislation which is of the character of the Sherman anti-trust law in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or of the Australian Industries Preservation Act which proscribes conduct as unlawful and substitutes for it provisions which are subject to the test of whether they contravene the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For United Slates corporations the attractions that Australia offered  were  clear from the fact that by the end of 1967 there were only 4 countries in the world - Canada, the United Kingdom, West Germany and Venezuela - where the book value of <span class="highlight">United States</span> investments exceeded the amount invested in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because in the course of a recent visit overseas 1 found that governments in Europe and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were lowering interest rates considerably as a measure to counter rising prices and to stimulate their flagging economies, will the Treasurer explain to the Parliament why in Australia we persist in excessive interest rates which promote inflation, saddle home builders in particular with heavy burdens of debt, depress the vital building industry and conduce to the coming depression? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following initial approaches by Ministers and officials, in March 1970 a report by an Australian Defence Industries Mission which visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to explore the possibility of increasing <span class="highlight">United States</span> procurement from Australia was considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that there are problems such as the difficulties being experienced by the industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> … but the Government of Australia proposes to continue to work with industry to improve the flow of offset orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it seemed to me, an area of great misunderstanding, and - one might say fairly - of much Press speculation a great part of which was singularly ill-informed, and the Senate having asked me to deal fairly exhaustively with the affairs of Qantas, I think I am entitled to say something about this matter: The agreement reached with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> represents a reasonable and realistic solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In ils terms it did not permit prior agreement between the governments oh frequencies before an extra service was introduced; nor did it enable us to argue that a second <span class="highlight">United States</span> carrier could not be allowed on the South Pacific route to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years Qantas operated more frequencies than the single <span class="highlight">United States</span> carrier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This position has altered only in the last 3 years, during which time a second <span class="highlight">United States</span> carrier was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, through taking a strong attitude we have limited the number of extra frequencies that <span class="highlight">United States</span> carriers could introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This position was maintained in talks with <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities in 1970 and again in 1971 in the Washington discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> carriers with the support of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities sought originally an increase of 150 per cent in seat capacity from the beginning of 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been a period of great adjustment in the South Pacific with the large Boeing 747s coming into service as well as the commencement of operations by a second <span class="highlight">United States</span> carrier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our approach has been to persuade the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to accept the need for governmental intervention and scrutiny in relation to these extra flights that their carriers proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are aware of something that is happening on the Pacific or Atlantic coasts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> affecting longshoremen we can anticipate that a similar happening here will result in an industrial complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to that question, the Treasurer stated that the 2 loans of$US80m and $US75m respectively had been approved to assist in financing the purchase of the 24 F111C aircraft, spares and associated equipment, the source of each loan being the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pointI am making here is that between 1966 and 1968 the Government, by means of a Bill similar to that now before us, sought approval to raise$US155m from the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objection I take to clause 4 is that we are being asked to approve a Bill to raise an amount of$US90m from the same source not knowing, as my colleague  Senator Cavanagh  said in the course of his remarks, whether it would be required to be spent in the purchase of hardward from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to borrow from the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a sum of S90m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An agreement was made for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department to be credited with $US123m for supplies we would receive between 1st July 1970 and 3 1 st December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) 1970, the Commonwealth arranged borrowings of  $US123m  to finance orders for general defence equipment to be placed with <span class="highlight">United States</span> suppliers during 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount of $4,644,183 mainly related to billings rendered by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government under the current financial arrangements and included accounts totalling $116,498 processed in Australia in respect of supplies and services associated with the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, a commitment fee of $355,146 was paid in respect of the undisbursed balance of credit made available by the ExportImport Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to assist in financing the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1966-67 the rate of interest on these credits has been reflecting high rates of interest of government borrowings and commercial borrowings on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> capital market, but the rate of interest of  6i  per cent in the current credit, which is lower than in the previous 2 credits, is still about 2 per cent or 3 per cent lower than would be available to the Government for other purchases overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister added that the situation was continually under review and that any short-term change in the rate against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar should not necessarily be taken as an indication as to the long-term rate that will eventually be settled for the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government chose to make this loan available to the ExportImport Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The technical arrangements for this loan were as follows: For each of the financial years 1966-67, 1967-68, and 1968-69 Australia, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department and the ExportImport Bank concluded note purchase agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these agreements Australia issued promissory notes to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department for disbursements against the, loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department sold those notes to the Export-Import <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unused balance of this loan will be drawn to finance payments on defence orders already placed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also raises the question of the arrangements we have with the ExportImport Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, from which we seem to be seeking loans continuously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the table the Minister has supplied the amounts of the individual loans are all set out in millions of <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the amount drawn is the amount which Australia has received from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> under the authority of this loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final column in this table shows in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars that between 30th June 1971 and 31st October 1971 only $US13m was drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As noted in the table, these amounts are committed by orders already placed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator WEBSTER (Victoria) (5.2 1&gt; - I wish to ask a question of the Minister in relation to loans from the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether we do not nave available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by decision of this Parliament sufficient unused morey on which we are now paying ( per cent interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We desire to add $US90m lo ‘he reserves that we have and cannot use in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at the present time, apparently for no other reason than a desire to pay the Export-Import Bank  i  per cent interest on an extra $US90m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further Agreement was entered into pursuant lo the Act whereby the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> agreed to finance payments, not exceeding $US35,05 1,734, required to be made by the Commonwealth to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Defense and other suppliers of defence equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Government a surplus, which it is not using at present, under all the relevant Actsthat the Parliament has passed and under the agreements that it has entered into with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government no money available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could the Minister give some information on that aspect of the Auditor-General’s Report to which I referred, particularly as to how much is available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at present under previous agreements and which has not been used? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>money available on loanthrough the Export-Import Bank of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It rests a great deal upon equipment purchased and supplied from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, for obvious, good, sensible and wise reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fundamentally, therefore, for various reasons its defence or supply train links it to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When governments borrow from other governments, particularly in the case of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, they also pay a commitment fee - in this, case per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commitment fee applies now in the case of all loans from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, whether from commercial resources or from the Export-Import <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Orders are in hand with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> suppliers for the full amount of the credit which has already been arranged and the actual disbursements are lagging behind the orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the report of the Auditor-General seems to reveal a practice of the Treasurer’s paying whatever he likes from <span class="highlight">United States</span> loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At page 361 of the report we find that in relation to the procurement of munitions and aircraft productionthe following was said about credit arrangements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>5m and that in addition $92,048 was chargedto the loan fund under the credit arrangement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When it comes to an allocation to a department for a particular project it would appear that additionally we had these reserves whichcan be used for payments tothe <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been trying to find out what credit we have in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the loans that have already been authorised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What credit do we have in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it necessary for us to add another $90m to our credit in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during this session of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be told whether we have credits in hand in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and whether it is likely, as has been the case in ; he past, that we may not need those resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be told also when it is likely that we will need to have additional money available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to meet further commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I answered  Senator Cavanagh  earlier when I made the comment that the undrawn amounts that have been referred to are already committed for equipment which has been ordered but the payment for which has not been covered by the present Bill; that is, orders already in hand with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> suppliers will require the full amount of the credit which has already been arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Cavanagh  is trying to help me, but it is very difficult to see how and why.I am just trying to go through the defence situation to illustrateto the honourable senator the gigantic size of the defence programme and to point out quietly,I hope, that substantially the equipment is obtained for good and sensible reasons in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America because this suits our weapons and equipment programme, and also our arrangements with allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1966-67 the rate of interest ‘ on these credits has been reflecting the high rates of interest on governmental and commercial borrowings on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> capital market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact of commercial borrowing in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and indeed in some other countries now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-95">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) Although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate voted on 29th October to defeat the Administration’s 1971-72 Foreign Assistance Authorisation Bill, the Government’s understanding is that this does not mean the cessation of <span class="highlight">United States</span> aid to developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I. would remind them also that if the experience of the major industrial countries such as the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which preceded Australia into the stagflation club, are any guide, this type of unemployment, unless tackled quickly and thoroughly, tends to become chronic and permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the miserable policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, with its fictitious price of gold at SUS35 per ounce, are the mine owners to be left in the position of having to have caretakers in their mines until the American Government settles its monetary differences with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics so that any increase in the price of gold will not boost the economy of the USSR? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am satisfied the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is fully aware of the political and strategic importance of the Indian Ocean and agrees that a careful watch should be continued in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe the administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Government in Britain and leading representatives of the media in both countries now have a greater awareness of Australia - as a country of stability and increasing influence in the South East Asian region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I stressed, particularlyin the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the indirect implication tor Australia of any sharp check of economic growth and trade in third countries, such as Japan, as a result of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In America I urged on the Administration the need to remove barriers in the way of world trade in agricultural commodities and raised at the highest level the problems we face in our attempt to export Australian wool and meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been quite apparent to the Department and to me that if wc succeeded as we have succeeded in breaking through in the low fare operation overseas to the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Europe, as has been announced, this would undoubtedly show a comparison between such fares and the fares for long distances in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the case in many of the States in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, lt is the case in not only both Western Europe and Eastern Europe but in many parts of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has not been any discussion in this country, nor any serious discussion in this Parliament, in the same way as there has been in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, for example, where there has recently been a decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly an almost identical provision in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Constitution was held by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court to prohibit grants of this kind being made in that country and one would have thought that at least when this rather unique proposition was presented to the Senate the Minister, if only in passing, would have touched on this very important mater relating to our Constitution and the philosophy which, I have understood, for many years has been one of the hallmarks of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To those people who say that we can cure all the problems of education by giving more money, I suggest that we look at the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all we needed to do was to build a lot more universities and make it possible for every youngster who wants to go to a university to go there free of charge, the experience of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should indicate that that is what we have to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But while we pay 4 per cent of our national income on education, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> spends 7 per cent of ils national income on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like honourable senators to consider what we are told about the results in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as far as its youth is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be factors other than the ones we are told about in relation to what is happening to the youth of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but it would appear that spending more and more money on education and making it easier for people to go to tertiary institutions free of charge has not produced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the kind of community that we would want here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the Australian Government will inform the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, following the controversial dismissal of the former commander of the Harold E.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very properly therefore, before responding to a question which implies that we should be sending almost dictatorial signals to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, I would think that the obvious thing to do would be to get the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the nationality of Beck’s father he was at binh a citizen of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America by descent as well as being an Australian citizen by birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Beck had arrived in Mexico with an American passport, it was the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Consul who was informed of Beck’s arrest and not the Australian Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time the economic measures subsequently taken by the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the consequent international currency disturbances could not be predicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer first to the 1969 edition of the ‘Senate Manual’ of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which states that a Joint Congressional Committee on Immigration and Nationality Policy has been established to investigate the problems of aliens and nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say in passing that I know that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had some inbuilt immigration problems between 1924 and the Second World War that Australia did not exactly experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which has a long-standing committee system, found 3 or 4 years ago that this happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few weeks ago some of the members of the Opposition were lauding the statements of an alleged learned professor who had been brought to Australia from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to tell us we must join the zero population growth movement; that we should not be filth sinners and have more than 2 children to * family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps we should adopt an immigration policy somewhat similar to that which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has had for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote now from the book ‘A Nation of Immigrants’ written by John F. Kennedy, an illustrious <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If some of those people want in this country the kind of problems that face the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Great Britain - if they foster that type of policy in this country - they have not much regard for the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government’s decision to cosponsor the resolution seeking the admission of the People’s Republic of China to the United Nations Organisation mean that the Government has changed its attitude towards China, or has pressure been applied on the Australian Government by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to support their current policy towards the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do Australian Government records show that 2.12 million kangaroo skins were exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the period 1966-1970, and do <span class="highlight">United States</span> statistics reveal that 3.76 million kangaroo skins were imported from Australia during the same period: if so, what is the reason for the discrepancy in these import/export figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table below shows details of Australia’s exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of undressed kangaroo and wallaby fur skin, measured by ‘number of skins’, for the years 1966-67 to 1969-70 and <span class="highlight">United States</span> imports from Australia of raw or cured kangaroo or wallaby skins, measured by ‘pieces’ and by ‘pounds weight’, for the calendar years 1967 to 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As can be seen from the table, throughout the period there is a difference of only 47,410 between the number of skins exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the number of pieces’ imported from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reason for this difference is to be found in the fact that the Bureau of Census and Statistics figures relate to financial years while the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Commerce statistics relate to calendar years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The original signatories to the Agreement were Turkey, Greece and Australia - Australia participated at industry level with the endorsement of the Australian Government - and while the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was not a signatory it adhered from the outset to the terms of the Agreement in every way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During its lifetime the conferences held under, the Agreement were all chaired by  Mr Setrakian  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which is the world’s largest producer of dried vine fruits and which, as explained previously, while not a signatory to the Agreement faithfully adhered to its terms during its lifetime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was one thing which was brought out in the evidence taken by the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution it was this: We studied 20 years of efforts by the States of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in which each State went its own way and established some watery co-ordinating plans, none of which worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was  Mr Finch,  who was Secretary for Health  in an earlier <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration, who indicated very forcibly that a time will come when an industry virtually will have to be told to close down if it is an extreme polluter of the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not doubt the motives of the Department, but in view of developments in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> I had hoped that the honourable Peter Howson would have assumed the mantle of Steward Udall or Henry Hicker,  or even  Mr Morton,  a subsequent Secretary of the Interior in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the background basis of the matter to which I referred - the Minister’s advisers will know what 1 am getting at - we all know the terrific upheaval which occurred over the Florida Everglades and the conflict between <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army engineers, reclamation people and conservationists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress has not appropriated funds to pay the contributions due from the United Stales for the period sine: 1st July 1970, and the United Stales is therefore in arrears with its contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  2  matters under consideration are, firstly, the maintenance in Vietnam of a small Australian Army Assistance Group (AAAG) after the withdrawal of the Australian Force Vietnam; and secondly, the provision of Australian military instructors to train Cambodian military personnel at <span class="highlight">United States</span> training establishments set up with the co-operation of the Vietnamese Government in Phuoc Tuy Province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Army Assistance Group is a matter for Australia and the Republic of Vietnam; the proposals to train Cambodian troops in Vietnam involve the governments of Australia, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator will recall that, just before the Parliament rose at the end of the last session, the  Deputy  Secretary of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Defence,  Mr Packard,  came to Australia with departmental officers of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it correct to say that these requests preceded the <span class="highlight">United States</span> interest on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think also it is even more incorrect to look on the problems which have to be resolved if we are to have peaceful relations with our neighbours in the Indian Ocean as being solely the result of the intervention of major powers, whether they be Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Soviet Union or China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While on the one hand the Pope is offering prayers for the success of  President  Nixon’s visit to Peking and, at the other extreme, both India and the Soviet Union are expressing concern about the possibility of a new alliance between China and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, we can get no intelligible statement whatsoever from this Government apart from the usual old anti-Communist claptrap it has been serving up for about 25 years that everything which is going on is the part of some Red plot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators will be aware the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  during a visit overseas last year discussed the position of the Indian Ocean both in England and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee has examined in some detail great power involvement and interests in the Indian Ocean region - specifically, the role and interests of Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan, China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee discussed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Middle East force operating from Bahrain in paragraph 31 of its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government has announced that on 23 rd December 1971 it concluded an agreement with Bahrain under which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is to lease parts of the former British naval base at Jufair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had an informal arrangement with Britain on behalf and with the approval of the Bahrain Government, under which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Middle East force - comprising a converted seaplane tender, as a flagship and 2 destroyers - had been based on Jufair for over 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent British decision to return the Jufair facilities to Bahrain would have left the Middle East force without a base, and it had therefore become necessary for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to negotiate a status of forces and leasing arrangement with the Bahrain Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> spokesmen have made clear that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Middle East force based on Bahrain will not be enlarged, and it remains the only permanent <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval presence in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answering Press inquiries about the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-Bahrain arrangement on 6th January 1972, a Pentagon spokesman also indicated that units of the Seventh Fleet would continue to operate in the Indian Ocean from time to time, but not on any fixed schedule or at any fixed or permanent level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He revealed that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Commander-in-Chief Pacific Fleet, to whose command the Seventh Fleet belongs, has been given responsibility for <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval operations in most of the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Pentagon spokesman commented that this new arrangement was to bring the Indian Ocean area under one unified command and would enhance <span class="highlight">United States</span> capabilities to operate there if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although these statements do not indicate any change in <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy inasmuch as elements of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Seventh Fleet have made random sorties and conducted exercises in the Indian Ocean before, the Australian Government welcomes continued <span class="highlight">United States</span> deployments in the Indian Ocean and the agreement with Bahrain, as well as the development of the joint United StatesUnited Kingdom communications facility at Diego Garcia, and sees this evidence of United States1 interest as a valuable and necessary demonstration that the United Stales has a security role and capability in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has developed Polaris missiles with a range of 2,500 miles which, if they were deployed in submarines in “ the Indian Ocean, would threaten any of the cities of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nearly half the world’s tanker tonnage belongs to NATO countries, and when Japanese tankers; plus those registered in Liberia but owned inAmerica (and in the last resort likely to call on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy rather than the 200-man Liberian Navy for protection) are included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind him that no less a person than a former <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President, Senator Lyndon  Johnson, had problems with the American Federation of Labour over the influx of Mexican farm labourers, known as wetbacks, coming over the border into California. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-134">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the AFL was able to persuade an American  President  to take up with the Mexican  President  the status of Mexicans entering the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, in the lengthy discussions between our Prime Minister and Edward Heath the matters that I have raised should have been finalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-134">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the salary of at least one of these persons is met by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Central Intelligence Agency or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, if not, which organisation is responsible for the payment of salaries and expenses of expatriate persons who are assisting the United Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is one country where there is a definite system for coping with national disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Act defines major disasters to include, as  we  would expect, floods, droughts, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, storm or other catastrophe in any part of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which is or threatens to be of sufficient magnitude to warrant disaster assistance by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I return to the scheme which operates in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If what can be done by such organisations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada and one or two other countries which have established effective organisations can be of value to their people, surely we in Australia ought to do the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is true that the Leader of the Opposition has brought the proposition up to date by reference to what has happened in more contemporary times in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to which I will refer in a moment, may have some overtones of alteration that we would not be able to apply here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The procedure is such that the system operates in the very way that  Senator Murphy  has suggested the schemes in Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the concept is different because the role of the  President  is different from that of our parliamentary institutions and our State and local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor has the honourable senator indicated, as I understand it, what was being done in the Canadian and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> scene in that regard, although I thought he did say that bodies could go to the  President  for special financial aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He mentioned what is done in Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but they do not have the same sort of federal system that we have here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Canada, Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America all have organisations of a like nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, under the Federal Disasters Act of the United Slates provision is made for cooperation between the Federal Administration of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the States of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has a Bureau of Reclamation which uses the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army Engineers Corps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assure honourable senators that I am not quot ing from the’New Statesman’ or ‘Nation’; I am quoting no less a person than Lyndon Baines Johnson, the former  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, under federal systems, Ottawa and Washington do much more than Canberra does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force in the purchase of spares follows the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Treasury Armed Services Procurement Regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is for those components to be fitted to a new aircraft which are already in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Services Inventory, procurement is made direct from vendors or the sub-contractors to take advantage of large volume buys and the appropriate price advantages associated with this practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must emphasise that the General Accounting Office report is not available here yet and it relates naturally to <span class="highlight">United States</span> practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if sub-contractor purchasing was followed for parts to be used in the actual production of the aircraft, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force would be involved in a major task of configuration management, maintenance of technical records and quality control at the sub-contractor’s works as well as the main contractor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the RAAF is concerned, our buys of spare parts are made through the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Armed Forces rather than through a prime contractor or a subcontractor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years this has been shown to give us price advantages as our purchases are combined with the high volume procurement of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force, I understand, controls profit margins and overhead factors which we would be faced with if we were to purchase direct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth noting that the RAAF did not order any spares from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the period May 1970 to December 1971 while the requirements of the Fraser/ Laird minute were still to be satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until the report has been examined both in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and here, one cannot say categorically that there has been overcharging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were following the procedure adopted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada and in other countries we would say to the committee dealing with constitutional and legal affairs: ‘You will consider all matters of law and justice, bankruptcy, copyright, the Judiciary Act, administrative review matters and so on’, and then leave the committee to deal with the various aspects which were important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of this number 407 have been accepted by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In directing my question to the Minister for Health T refer to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> committee which recently reported on the drug marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Did that body recommend that alt existing <span class="highlight">United States</span> legal sanctions and penalties be actively pursued against the pedlars and pushers of the drug? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a measure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government’s concern at the adverse effects of that drug that the existing penalties against pedlars and pushers are particularly heavy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal law to have, give or sell marihuana in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a felony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a nation called Israel and I admit, without anyone telling me, that it receives pretty big handouts from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is one of the world’s super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>She possesses vast quantities of financial reserves, natural resources and manpower, enabling the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to accept a large responsibility in assisting the growth and development of the under-privileged nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads the various statements of the Prime Minister of India, the new Prime Minister of Bangla Desh and the Prime Ministers of Ceylon and other countries in the Indian Ocean area one finds that they take a somewhat similar view - that the Soviet Union should accept some responsibility, as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> does, in assisting the growth and development of the under-privileged nations of that part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it will be found, as 1 shall show later, that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> secs nothing unusual in the fact that another major power seeks to interest itself in the affairs of the Indian Ocean, because that is a prerogative that it exercises in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there would be many people who would like to see the Indian Ocean free from the influence of the major powers, the fact is that if it is the prerogative of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> it is also the prerogative of the other major powers to become involved in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think any reasonable person would agree that the conclusion reached by the Committee in respect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has some substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The achievement and the maintenance of a strategic balance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; the extension of Soviet influence both in a military and an economic sense throughout the world in competition with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and other Western powers; and the curtailment, as far as possible, of the influence of the PRC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>[ have taken the trouble to do some research on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> attitude to the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I obtained extracts from hearings of the Sub-Committee on National Security Policy and Scientific Developments of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives on 20th, 22nd, 27th and 28th July 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt Jnr, also spoke about the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean in his testimony before the Sub-Committee of the Committee on Appropriations on 15th March 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Committee of Appropriations hearing, the Defence Secretary,  Mr Laird,  when questioned about <span class="highlight">United States</span> interests in the Indian Ocean, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the strategic and political interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the Indian Ocean are, over the next 5 years at least, of a substantially lower order than it is in either of the other great ocean basins - the Atlantic and the Pacific - both because they border on these and because the States along those shores are for the most part economically, politically and militarily more important than those of the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the men in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> concerned with <span class="highlight">United States</span> interests and, for those who want to use the terminology as they have done with great frequency and emphasis over the years, the interests of the free world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the DLP has lost its international support in the sense that previously the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was regarded as being a power which would protect us in all circumstances but we have found that America applies those principles which affect its own national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Ministers of these countries - as distinct from our own Prime Minister whom 1 will admit, to my knowledge, has not made a pronouncement on the matter but will during the coming general election - came to the same conclusion as  Mr Friedheim,  again of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, who in Washington on 10th January when he was discussing the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean had something to say which is in accordance with the standpoint of most of the nations in the Indian Ocean region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to  Mr Friedheim,  there had been some surveillance between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Soviet forces in the area but ‘nothing unusual in the context of what happens all the time around the world1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is competent to express the view that China and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America can find the means to live in peace, I think that surely in Australia we can adopt a much more mature attitude instead of our normal behavioural pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note with great satisfaction the growing interest by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in the Indian Ocean region and the need for that nation to maintain a naval presence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is in Australia’s interests to encourage a greater presence of and participation by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> navy in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policies become important - the recommendations of the Committee in this regard are of particular importance - because of the need for us to provide for our defence and to provide, in alliances with nations such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Britain, naval and air bases and so on on the western coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I make is that if it is good enough for the most obscure national leader who visits Washington to deal with these gut issues - that is what they are - and to confer with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President,  it is beyond my comprehension that our leaders cannot deal with the British Prime Minister,  Mr Heath,  or the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say this to  Senator Greenwood:  I hope that in our dealings with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and when discussing matters with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  it will not be infra dig for us to raise matters that concern a very important segment of the Australian community, particularly at a time when job security is not what it used to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because Australia imports annually from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> drama programmes valued at millions of dollars, many of which have violence as their central theme, will the Australian Government heed the warning given by the American SurgeonGeneral and suggest to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to the commercial television stations that they should produce and exhibit more programmes of an Australian character which depict, principally for the benefit of our younger generation, something of our country’s history and heritage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with  Senator Rae’s  suggestion that witnesses should be given reasonable protection, but anybody who has studied the counterpart of our committee system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would realise that not so long ago senior public servants in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were destroyed by the committees before which they appeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was another film dealing with Charles Dickens’ story ‘A Christmas Carol’ which was sold by one of the Australian companies for screening on the American CBS network, and I am told that that programme had a viewing audience in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of some 25 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am told that the American company, known as Hanna and Barbera, a multi-million dollar production company in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - a company which produces animated films such as The Flintstones’, ‘Yogi Bear’, The Jetsons’ and about 30 other popular television programmes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - now has established business in Australia and employes about 1,500 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact, of course, that Australian wage standards are much lower than those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but I imagine that the profits that will be made by this American company operating in Australia will be returned to Hollywood instead of Australia being able to earn, as it has been able to do over the past 12 months, a healthy export income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether his attention has been drawn to the recent warning by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Secretary,  Mr Melvin  Laird, that the Soviet Union is aiming to achieve overall military supremacy by the late 1970s and that the existing, dwindling margin of military superiority of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on present trends will disappear within the next 2 or 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with more particularity in response to the question I think I should say that in Australia we follow closely statements made from time to time by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Secretary,  Mr Laird,  on matters of relevant strength of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This ruling is in doubt following a decision in 1971 by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia which in effect interpreted the doctrine as meaning that a broadcaster cannot refuse to sell advertising time to groups or individuals wishing to speak out on controversial public issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to our treaty obligations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the statements attributed to  Dr Cairns  can be regarded only as a deplorable subversion of the united interests of Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator refers to a writ issued by the Commonwealth Government in August 1969 against the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and the Menasco Manufacturing Co. which arose, as he says, as the result of an accident involving an Orion aircraft in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in April 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, we seek an intensification of our defence undemanding with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and with Our northern neighbours in the expectation that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will, as pledged to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  since the Nixon Doctrine was promulgated, provide the foundation of Australian security against threats or actual attack going beyond Australian capacity to deal with alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To lay stress on dangerous contingencies against which Australian defence efforts must steadily prepare over the longer term is not inconsistent with the hopes entertained by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of progressively negotiating understandings which will reduce tensions among the  4  great powers: The Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan - and particularly among the  3  great military powers in this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not the slightest doubt that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> commitments to Australia under the ANZUS Treaty are as strong and effective as ever and it is my belief that it is the responsible attitude of this Australian Government towards the economic growth and the military security of this region that have contributed to maintaining this undeviating attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation that we face now is one in which we seem to be quite content to lease aircraft from or to enter into all sorts of agreements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to meet our needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, if at a given time Britain or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> established priorities which had to be met, they would get in first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If we take the situation in reverse, the ironical thing is that some perfectionist probably would argue that if aircraft are not obtained from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or Britain what are acquired are second grade articles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose one can take that a little further and argue that all the procrastination that has been associated with our negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the FI 1 1 aircraft, quite apart from the cost factor, meant that we are beholden now to another nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware that the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will make a statement on <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy on Vietnam at 1 p.m. tomorrow, Australian time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Australian Government been informed of the substance of  Mr Nixon’s  statement or has it been consulted as to future <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy on the war in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously any communication between the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Prime Minister is not a matter for discussion at question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, there are the notes of the meeting of 2nd and 3rd October 1971 which deal with such matters as  President  Nixon’s announcement of his projected visit to China, the world power situation, the basis of new policy orientations in China and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and various other strategic matters of foreign policy, including policy submissions, defence policy, foreign policy and the industrial situation, which covers such things as the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that the international Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, reputed to be the tenth largest corporation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, has made an offer of more than $8m for an Australian owned food company, Frozen Food Industries Ltd? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Are Cuban lobster tails, which are banned as imports in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, being exported from Cuba to Tokyo in Japan, reshipped from Tokyo to Sydney and then exported from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as Australian rock lobsters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister investigate whether Cuban lobster tails exported as Australian rock lobsters have been shipped to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on the refrigerated container ship ‘Sultana’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information received by officers of the Department of Customs and Excise some little time ago suggested that lobster tails of Cuban origin were being trans-shipped to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America via Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the information known to the Australian Department of Customs and Excise was passed direct to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> customs officials, and further inquiries in Australia were temporarily suspended in order that it might be confirmed whether the shipment was in fact of Cuban origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This course of action would have enabled the <span class="highlight">United States</span> customs officials to take any punitive action necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The future course of action by Australian Department of Customs and Excise is to be determined when the position is clarified following the arrival of the vessel in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Needless to say, if the tails prove to be tails of Cuban origin, or indeed any other foreign origin, attempting to enter the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market in the guise of Australian produce, steps will be taken to ensure that no shipments of this kind are made in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen a report in a Melbourne daily newspaper to the effect that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force has used nerve gas in South Vietnam; if so, will the Minister ascertain the truth of the report and, if true, inform the Parliament: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further to a question which I placed on the notice paper at his invitation on 26th April 1972, I now ask him whether he has seen an article in the ‘Sunday Australian’ of 30th April headed ‘Gunn Drops $7.6m offer to <span class="highlight">United States</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Civil Aviation seen the published statement that in 1970 approximately 26,000 supersonic flights took place over the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of flights of supersonic aircraft over the <span class="highlight">United States</span> referred to by the honourable senator is substantially correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the Securities and Exchange Commission started an inquiry more than 2 years ago on one aspect alone - that of brokers’ rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be recalled that at a recent Senate inquiry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> it was revealed that this giant conglomerate first of all set out to try to prevent the election of the Allende Government in Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I well recall in the 1966 election - the Vietnam election, the khaki election - a DLP spokesman saying that Australia could not afford to do anything about overseas capital or to impose restraints upon overseas capital at that time because such action could place in jeopardy the interest that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America might take in the defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard that over many years there has been a strong feeling in Canada that many Canadian resources are in the hands particularly of <span class="highlight">United States</span> controllers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the ‘Courier-Mail’ of 28th January 1972 it was announced that a DutchUnited States-French consortium would be negotiating a franchise agreement covering the development of the Aurunkun bauxite deposits on Cape York Peninsula, estimated at more than 300 million tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, 40 per cent of that investment came from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and no doubt it has been of significant benefit both to the business community and the private citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it was quite different from the Australian position inasmuch as overseas investment in Australia comes mainly from 2 countries, Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South America may be an indication of the situation because many countries of South America were subject to uncontrolled British or <span class="highlight">United States</span> capital investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering the history of relations between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, I think of the ultramilitancy adopted by  Senator Lillico  and  Senator Lawrie  in relation to American trade policies which affected sections of our rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister for Primary Industry make a statement on 4th May that, following an amendment to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> meat inspection regulations, a serious situation capable of affecting Australia’s meat export trade has developed, and that the elimination of tuberculosis from all properties in Australia is likely to be very costly indeed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to observe that in its first annual report the Metric Conversion Board indicated that the only major country in the world which is now not actually committed to conversion to the metric system is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation: With the concern being expressed by some people over the proposed supersonic flight of the Concorde aircraft over some parts of Australia, can he say whether any figures are available of supersonic flights over Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and what were the effects of those flights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the question may be as to the action to be taken, I do not think anybody would dispute that the findings of responsibly constituted bodies throughout the world - and most recently the presidential commission in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - have been to the effect that there is no harm in marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is well known, for example, that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the prohibition of alcohol from 1919 to 1933, under the Volstead Act, led to a very great increase in crime in that country, not only crime which directly resulted from the inclusion of the possession of alcohol within the framework of the criminal law but also a number of other crimes which arose indirectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter that impressed me in  Dr Wallner’s  article was that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> while these older people said that they felt that they could take the drugs and leave them, the tendency was that the age at which young people experimented in drugs was falling to the degree that now - I quote her words - ‘large numbers of children under 10 are being noticed in drug treatment facilities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this question, as on so many questions, it is rather surprising to me on occasions - or it would be if I had not become inured to such happenings - to find that a government which for years has been telling us that we must adopt the American way of life, that everything that happens in the American system is something which we should emulate, that if only every country of the world was like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> all of our problems would be solved and that it is unpatriotic to say that we should not go ‘All the way with L.B.J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember on one occasion attending a meeting of shop stewards of the International Association of Machinists at which a resolution was carried by the many hundreds of delegates present repudiating some suggestions which had been made in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate that a system - a mild system in comparison with that which exists in this country - of compulsory arbitration should be introduced into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason I instance the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is that if there is any country which is the heart land of capitalism, if there is any country - within the framework of reference of the Government, within the ideology of the Government, within the aspirations of the Government - has been successful, it is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I refer to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is that the sort of legislation which has been on the statute books in Australia for many years and which periodically is worsened by legislation such as that which is before us at the moment would not be tolerated for one second either by the American trade union movement or by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress, and it would be an act of selfdestruction for any American presidential candidate even to hint that he contemplated any piece of legislation remotely resembling the outrageous Bill which is now before this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned earlier, this Government is often apt to cite to us the experiences and example of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, this bastion of the free world, in support of which we were obliged to send some hundreds of Australians to be killed in Vietnam and to kill no-one knows how many Vietnamese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet when one looks at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> one finds that the industrial laws of that country bear no resemblance to the repressive measures which this Government has been introducing consistently since it has been in office, and which have culminated in the Bill which is before the Senate at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I use the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as an example not because I believe that it has anything remotely resembling a perfect system but because this Government quotes the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as the exemplar for this country and for what it humorously describes as the free world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the information available to the Public Service Board, it would appear that more use is made of economy air travel by government and parliamentary officers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America than in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The history of labour injunctionsin the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was a great disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally the Congress of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had to place curbs upon the various endeavours through the courts and by the use of equity procedures to prevent trade unions carrying out their legitimate functions of endeavouring by disputations, bans or limitations, or by any other weapon which they had at their disposal, to try to advance the interests of their members against the great power of those who were employing them and who were able to organise freely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, West Germany and even countries in Eastern Europe make sure that their basic heavy industries are fully involved in all major projects of this nature undertaken in their countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a comparison is made of the growth of air freight in this country with that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, it reveals that air freight is the poor sister of passenger carrying in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast there was a revolution in air freight in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America although not over the same period as the one to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the figures to which I have referred for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America indicate that there has been some-, thing akin to an explosion of air freight operations over the period L mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, although in a number of other countries^ - namely the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries, to mention those that come immediately to my mind - there is no advertising either on television or on radio of cigarettes or cigarette tobacco, the Australian Government in this legislation is taking the easy course, is treading the half-way path, in an endeavour to appease those who advocate a complete ban, on the one hand, and those who do not want any interference at all, on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose he is referring, by way of illustration, to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I ask the honourable senator to bear in mind that at the time cigarette advertising was tolerated on radio and television in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America there was what was known as a fairness doctrine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 when I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, shortly after every cigarette advertisement, there was an advertisement advocating the complete banning of cigarettes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One recalls just how quickly cigarette smoking was accepted by women in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One recalls the promotion that was used by the Lucky Strike company to extend smoking in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, cigarette advertising in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> became of no advantage to the cigarette companies when contra advertising was permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that the cigarette companies feared greatly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was not the ban on cigarette advertising but the compulsory contra advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for that reason that the cigarette companies accepted the ban on cigarette advertising in the .<span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued that the banning of cigarette advertising in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did not immediately reduce the increase in cigarette smoking, but it did considerably slow it down and it is too early to know the result; it will take a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sale of alcohol was banned in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the history of that experiment, which is so close to us, shows how completely futile that was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where cigarette advertising is completely banned, manufacturers have found other (but more expensive) means of attracting attention to their products, with the result that cigarette sales are reported to be up by 17 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Prime Minister announced on 22nd December 1971, the Government has decided to maintain the existing gold parity of the Australian dollar and, at the same time, to set the market rate for the Australian dollar on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar close to the bottom of the permissible  2  per cent range about par. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, following the latest statement by the Attorney-General on the entry of <span class="highlight">United States</span> criminals into Australia, are we to assume that in the past we placed undue emphasis on political activity and not sufficient emphasis on criminal activity when screening entrants into Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be fair to say to the honourable senator that an offer has been made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and that this offer is under consideration at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ projections are taken as a guideline, this four billion cubic feet deficit would increase to over six billion cubic feet by the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the important thing: Perhaps the Australian Government even now is lagging behind other governments of the world because the evidence is that all governments - when I say ‘all governments’ I am speaking of those of the Western world of which we take notice, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that foreign countries, including Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Japan, insist upon a substantial portion of their national trade being carried in their ships and that since October 1970 the <span class="highlight">United States</span> programme puts its target at 17 per cent while the comparable Australian quota is 1.7 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We like to say - and I think with some justification - that our involvement in international aid is a creditable and satisfactory one considering the population of Australia which is not as b:g as that of countries such as Japan, the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the history of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which is one of the giants of world finance and banking, we find a history of monetary and banking collapse running into large proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem facing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America could very well result from the influence which high rates of interest are having upon this wealthy nation whose economy was tremendously stable when rates of interest were half what they are now, but which today is going through the throes of many economic problems - problems which affect not only the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but also other nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the last 2 years right throughout the world enormous pressures have been placed upon economies and, indeed, upon employment levels by the economic situation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the revaluation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> currency and the depreciation of trade upon which Japan had come to depend in its purchasing of raw materials from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the predicters of gloom in this country would have been measuring unemployment in terms of 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the total employable community had one said 12 months before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> currency began to wobble that it would wobble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would, I think, bring to light what was brought to light in Japan and England; that companies were recalling their cars in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and they were not recalling the same cars in Japan or England because there was no requirement of defect notification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently, because of the decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to prohibit the importation of meat of this type into that country, the Australian Meat Board made certain recommendations to the Commonwealth Governnent on what action it thought should be taken to try to step up the eradication of this disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Air and it follows questions asked by  Senator Willesee  relating to the alarming disclosures by the Auditor-General and the newspapers in connection with overcharging of Australia by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Armed Forces to the extent of $1m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have noted the Press reports indicating that the Australian Defence Services may have sustained possible overcharges amounting to $US900,000 in respect of supplies from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is not clear in the newspaper reports, these overchargesarose from the incorrect application by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> agencies of percentage on costs known as accessorial charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pleased to say that all but $US4,720 has been financially adjusted our way by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the disclosure of the incorrect charges my Department is examining in detail the nature and extent of the checking performed by Australian staff in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be appreciated that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Armed Services are alsomonitoring the purification of their computer records and without prompting from Australia, adjustments are automatically made to previous billings on the ascertainment of refined details. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As anomalies in the computer process are detected appropriate rectification is being effected and when the system is perfected the Department will reap the labour saving benefits it planned to achieve in departing from the tedious manual process, lt must be appreciated also that ‘discrepancies’ as reported by the AuditorGeneral means ‘under-billings’ as well as excess-billings’ and there is no evidence of deliberate overcharging by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the country that is supposed to be the paragon of private enterprise - and .1 refer to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America - has had to concede that mergers, amalgamations and the creation of transport corporations are necessary in order to carry the load and to ease the burden on railway commuters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wool did not suffer the same revaluation troubles as the mining industry did because, as I have pointed out previously, the mining industry was concerned with <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars, and we revalued against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar; we did not revalue against other currencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the apparent concession by the Polish Government that Polish migrants who have acquired <span class="highlight">United States</span> citizenship need not worry about their citizenship being in jeopardy, I think it is fair to put to the Government that it should, if it has not already done so, seek to obtain the attitude of the Polish Government to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I replied that, if it was good enough for the then  President  Johnson of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to consult with the  President  of Mexico on Mexican rural workers being exploited in California, at least our Prime Minister could have acted similarly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the outcome of the inquiry ordered by the Minister into the alleged rackets involving the smuggling of Australian wallabies, via New Zealand, for sale in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Customs and Excise has no evidence that wallabies were being smuggled out of Australia via New Zealand for sale in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot see any point or profit in running an illegal traffic from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America through New Zealand when wallabies can be legally exported from New Zealand under the control and supervision of the New Zealand Forest Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party firmly believes that we ought to do in this country what has been done in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom and allow our people to vote at 18 years of age as the citizens of Papua New Guinea voted at 18 in the election held earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth Government should pui an astronaut in charge of the Commonwealth Council for National Fitness, although many honourable senators do go into space now and again, but I do implore that consideration be given to taking a lead from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that specialist representatives be placed on the Council for National Fitness so that plans can be laid to bring the endeavours of that body into line with what is required in the 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do know of the Canadian taxation system to restore some economic nationalism in its company ownership structure principally because of the tremendous intrusion of <span class="highlight">United States</span> capital into Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether you look at the United Kingdom where the gas industry is nationalised, or whether you look at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or Canada where the industry is under private enterprise, in all cases you will find a Federal or central authority of reference and decision which we in Australia seem to be lacking at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it is reasonable to have first past the post voting in the United Kingdom and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> because in both countries there is voluntary enrolment and voluntary voting, but to suggest engrafting a first past the post system onto the Australian electorate which has compulsory voting and compulsory enrolment is in my view a phoney suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government decision to tighten up on traveller visa procedures make conditions for Australians entering the <span class="highlight">United States</span> more restrictive than those under the procedures that operate when <span class="highlight">United States</span>  citizens  enter Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that there have been some recent changes in relation to entry to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but I think the position should be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> decision means that it has temporarily ended a situation whereby Australians and other travellers may spend up to 10 days in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> while in transit to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Convention came into force on 14th October 1971 following ratification by the tenth signatory State, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will recall, 24 F4E aircraft were leased from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force in 1970 to enable the Royal Australian Air Force to maintain proficiency and expertise in the strike role, pending a Government decision on the acceptance of the F111C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force made a proposal that Australia purchase the F4Es and associated equipment offering them at a price substantially lower than that provided by the original lease terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In parallel with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force’s purchase offer, the McDonnell Aircraft Company, which makes the F4E aircraft, made a conditional offer which could provide the Australian aircraft industry with the opportunity of participating in some offset work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After considering a detailed report on all these matters and bearing in mind the effects on the development of Australia’s force structure as a whole, the Government has concluded that although the terms of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force’s offer are attractive, the total cost and other consequences could not be justified against other high-priority major items now included in the projections of the 5 year defence programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has therefore decided not to accept the proposal made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many parts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the same thing has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to such significant problems as the unprecedented increases in salary, wage, superannuation and aircraft insurance costs, the curtailment by the Commonwealth of the migrant intake, the increasing competitive impact of additional European airline services on the Kangaroo Route, the non-scheduled charter carrier competition offering low fares between Europe and South East Asia, the introduction of lower international mail carriage rates, and the fall in the rate of traffic growth on the South Pacific route following a general economic downturn, especially in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While figures for the first 5 months - April to August - of the current financial year show a steady traffic growth on the Qantas total network, growth on the South Pacific route to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is not as buoyant, and capacity still remains a problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, under the procedures agreed between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australian governments in September 1971, the 2 governments are required to take into account the fact that the basic air transport agreement prescribes that the services operated by their airlines over the South Pacific route should bear a close relationship to the requirements of the public for such services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of American Airlines, upheld by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government, to reduce its current frequencies into Australia, and not to proceed with extra frequencies planned for the end of this year, was a heartening indication of an acceptance of the view we had emphasised in Washington concerning the excess capacity situation on the route. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has, in fact, been no increases in capacity provided by <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australian carriers this year since Qantas introduced its 4 Boeing 747 flights very early in the year and, at the same time, reduced the number of its Boeing 70? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the financial year 1971-72 the company’s competitive position suffered from the fact that one of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> carriers had this aircraft type in use on the South Pacific for the whole year, whereas Qantas did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of the settlement of the disagreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on frequencies in September 1971, after some deferment the Qantas Boeing 747s were brought into operation and the company’s competitive position was thereby considerably improved, especially as the arrangements agreed upon have given Qantas the advantage of one 747 operation in 1972 more than the <span class="highlight">United States</span> carriers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the controls imposed by the Argentine and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on their export of hides and the subsequent inflated demand for Australian hides, local tanners are alarmed that they may not be able to obtain sufficient raw hides to service the shoe and leather industries which employ approximately 50,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The industry believes that the Government should set up the necessary machinery now to ensure that, if there is any export restraint by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or any other country which poses impossible problems for the Australian industry in its access to raw materials, immediate action could be taken to guarantee adequate supplies of Australian raw hides so that the local industry would not quickly collapse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we examine some of the history of the Red Indians in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> we see that even as far back as the time of  President  Theodore Roosevelt there was organisation by agencies and other government organisations, very much the sort of thing we are attempting to achieve now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some of the big economies of the world, like that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, monopolisation is the subject of a general proscription. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> monopolisation has long been governed by section 2 of the Sherman Act, which is concerned not only with abuse of monopoly power but with the need to prevent trends towards monopolistic concentrations of economic power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that Australian industry and commerce are amongst the most monopolised in the world, twice as much as in the United Kingdom and 3 times as much as in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America according to Professor Wheelwright as at some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bill is to make an amendment to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station (Civilian Employees) Act 1971 consequent upon the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators know, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station (Civilian Employees) Act 1971 extends to civilian employees employed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in connection with the station the terms of the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1971 as if they were employees of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To extend to these employees of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the new benefit of compensation at the rate of full sick pay that is provided for in the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1972 it is necessary to amend the Schedule to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station (Civilian Employees) Act 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not asking for the provision of the type of facilities which are given to a senator in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The function and role have altered significantly and tremendously to the stage where the Senate is taking on a role which is somewhat similar to, though not of the magnitude of, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Senatory Poyser has said, we do not have the facilities which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate has, we do not receive the emoluments which <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senators receive and we are not provided with the services which they get, and, in fact, our role constitutionally is different from that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nations like Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> can produce equivalent articles at a much cheaper price than ours because of their tremendous turnover and throughput. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As was explained when answering an earlier question from the honourable senator there are basic differences in the type of telephone exchange equipment installed in Australia as compared with, for example, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which precluded the Post Office from installing, at present, an automatic ticketing system so that details of all subscriber dialled trunk calls can be supplied to subscribers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The devaluation of the South African rand against sterling of approximately 12.4 per cent in November 1971, when the Australian dollar was divorced from its traditional ties with sterling and revalued at approximately 8 per cent against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar, has given the South African industry a most significant price advantage against Australia in the market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in 1967, with the great upsurge in world production and the increased  competition  particularly from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and South Africa, the situation changed dramatically for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of some of the revelations of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate committees which look at the question of where American aid is going and the fact that we are providing $2m under this aid programme, I would like to know whether we have any check on the currupt merchant group that permeates a lot of South East Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, this is in contrast to the policy adopted in Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has a very strong legislative and regulatory body - the Federal Maritime Commission - which is given wide powers in exercising jurisdiction over those conferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to consider for a moment how strongly those powers are expressed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Shipping Act of 1916. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of this Government’s long involvement with the Saigon regime in Vietnam, will it exert all its influence on President Thieu to persuade him to co-operate with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in that country’s attempt to gain a ceasefire? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Minister for Air that I asked him questions last week about losses of aircraft in Vietnam and whether the Royal Australian Air Force had sought information from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had supplied information to the Minister regarding the loss of the first aircraft and the temporary withdrawal of aircraft following that crash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister received any information from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or does the Air Force intend to investigate those matters to see whether there are any technical problems which ought to be considered by the Air Force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that this is very drastic, but it irritates me and the Opposition that all these new types of oil tankers, in the countries where they are registered, such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom and France, usually have incorporated all the modern designs, including receiver tanks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Coastguard Service appears to change its type of dispersants from time to time; that is, if one dispersant was on the market and the Coastguard Service had stockpiled it but believed that a better one was available, it would simply jettison its stockpiled supplies and use the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to advise the House of some decisions that have been taken in respect of certain installations with defence implications which have at one time or another been established in Australia following an approach to the Government by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I shall be speaking later about problems of this kind in relation to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communications Station at North West Cape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some joint Australia-<span class="highlight">United States</span> installations are public and well known, like the installation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, the Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> governments have given undertakings to each other to protect from unauthorised disclosure classified information which we share about these stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government will respect all classified information shared between us and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as well as with Britain, New Zealand and other powers, including our friends in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At this point I want simply to announce that there will be special provision for access for members of this Parliament, as would be the case if <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressmen were to visit the stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of the very few people directly associated with the central execution and control of the defence programmes of Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, no person will have greater access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All data available to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government from these facilities is available to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I expect later this year, at a mutually convenient time, to visit the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I go there, I shall further discuss these and other aspects of management and control of the installations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Secretary and his advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in these circumstances, should it be desirable, as I expect it will, we could expect that <span class="highlight">United States</span> advisers would discuss the implications of these matters with officials in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now turn to the matter of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station at North West Cape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an exchange of letters between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador and the then Minister for External Affairs on 7th May 1963, the Government publicly accepted the interpretation that the Australian Government’s right of consultation in Article 3 of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station agreement did not carry with it any degree of control over the station or its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> restricted in this way would not have been made by a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has told this Government that it is willing to enter into consultations and has said that it is prepared to make North West Cape a joint installation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister is still unable to answer the questions I have asked him today and those I asked on 6th March, will he give the Senate an assurance that Australia’s relations with Thailand will not be jeopardised in the way our relations have been with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Indonesia and South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the answer is yes, I ask why the Prime Minister has not released to the Parliament and the public the contents of his protest to the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in connection with the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time the protest against the bombing  of  North Vietnam was delivered  to  the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, in order to be even-handed why was not an emphatic protest against the invasion  of  South Vietnam by, as reported, 200,000 well equipped troops, which in fact triggered  off  the bombing referred  to  and protested against, delivered  to  the Hanoi Government instead  of  advancing a proposal  to  recognise that Government and to receive some of its trade union representatives in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  question could easily have been put to the other countries and persons around the world who were making similar protests, in various degrees, at the same time as the Australian Government made its protest to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government over the bombing of Hanoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, in my mind, the answer, both for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the South East Asian nations, is clearly that an American military presence cannot be a permanent feature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement of the Minister for Defence marked the first occasion on which a government of this country had sought to place openly on the record a clear expression of the place of <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence installations in Australia in terms of Australian national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s intention to take up those matters with the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to ensure a proper Australian role in management, operation and control of the installations, and to ensure that their presence is or remains consistent with Australia’s national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be of value and to the benefit of honourable senators opposite to say clearly that Australia does have national interests, in the defence area as in other areas, distinct from those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our defence alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is natural and reflects the breadth of our common interests in many fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relationship we seek with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is one based on maturity and mutual recognition that each is equally an independent and sovereign state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of the Australian Labor Party in respect of <span class="highlight">United States</span> installations in Australia has as its basis that each must be justified on the basis of an assessment of Australian national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We may take up all our concerns with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at one time, but it should be clear that the concerns we have about Pine Gap and Woomera are not the same as those we have about North West Cape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To date, some measure of this has been accomplished by the following: Firstly, we have access to the installations so that we know what is being done there; secondly, there is joint management of the facilities and participation by Australian civilians and servicemen in their operation; thirdly, all data available to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government from these facilities is available to the Australian Government; and fourthly, we have the right to use either or both systems to meet specifically Australian requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in these circumstances, should it be desirable, as I expect it will, we could expect that <span class="highlight">United States</span> advisers would discuss the implications of these matters with officials in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After a full and complete discussion regarding consultation on use of the station with Minister for External Affairs, il was clearly understood thai consultation connoted no more than consultation and was not intended to establish Australian control over use of station nor to imply any Government of Australia design to restrict at any time <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government use of station for defence communications, including, for example, communications for Polaris submarines, lt is also understood that it was not intended to give Australia control over or access to the contents of messages transmitted over the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister has said that the Government will negotiate with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for the application of the actual terms of the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to our approach, that is, the approach of the first Australian Government to seek consultations under Article 3 and to seek the restoration of Australia’s interests in this matter, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has told us that it is willing to enter into consultations and that it is prepared to make North West Cape a joint installation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We already have the desirability of this under study and this will be an aspect of the discussions we will be having with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in coming months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on the basis of friendship, independence and an abiding concern for Australian sovereignty that the outstanding matters in relation to <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence installations in Australia will be discussed with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the Queen’s Opposition, which claims that it was defeated unfairly in the election and which is competing with us for the management of this country on the basis that it is better able to run this country than the Labor Party is, debating a very important national issue, namely, <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases in Australia; and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate says: 1 must admit that  Dr Forbes,  in leading for the Opposition in the other place, had the intention of flushing out the differences between the left and right wings of the Labor Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be contesting, if they want to, the position of the Labor Party in respect of <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that, in the statement which [ read in this place on his behalf, the Minister for Defence made the point that there had been too much secrecy about the <span class="highlight">United States</span> installations; that it was an obligation of the Government to give the Parliament more information about them, which we are doing; and that it was an obligation of the Government to identify the differences between the previous Government and ourselves on some matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government now accepts the proposition that such installations should be open to members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some aspects of the operations of those stations will not be revealed to members of the Parliament - there are some things which cannot be told to members of the Parliament - but at least members of the Parliament will be able to visit the areas, will know the environment and will be better equipped to debate matters concerning them in the Parliament and to say whether in their opinion co-operation between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in those areas is a good idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring now to the sharing of those installations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, we are satisfied that it is a good thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This concerns the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communications Station at North West Cape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the North West Cape base, the Government feels that it should talk to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government about some matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to talk to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government as equal partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distinction between the point of view of the Opposition parties and our point of view is this: The Minister for Defence said that he believes that Australia should take up with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government the issue 01 control at North West Cape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following words be added to the motion: and recognising that the paper acknowledges (i) that the installations in central Australia are not part of a weapons system and are not able to be used to attack any country and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communications installation at North West Cape is used for the purpose of defence communication; . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect later this year, at a mutually convenient time, to visit the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The North West Cape station is a critical matter which should be left to the Government to consult its partner - the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America - to ensure that we are involved completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other place the Prime Minister stated quite clearly that if the amendment moved by  Dr Forbes  were carried shackles would be put on any Australian Minister who went to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to have talks about the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam said the Australian Labor Party supported the establishment of the radio base because it safeguarded Australia’s alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  said any Australian government should and would agree in advance that facilities at North West Cape could be immediately used in the event of an attack on the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I listened to  Senator McManus,  who made out a case for a little discretion on defence secrets, 1 was reminded that one of the things that always irked Government supporters when we were in opposition was that we were told to be seen and not heard, but we found that facts released to the Press from <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional inquiries were not given here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that irritated us, if we were expected to keep our side of the agreement in relation to the sanctity of defence secrets, was that the bounden duty on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress was not always adhered to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the statement that we have before us tonight will be the forerunner of more such statements which will allow us to look al the transition which will occur in foreign relations between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party will foster close and continuing co-operation with the people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and our Commonwealth partners to make these associations instruments for justice and peace . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the crucial points, of course, has been that every <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  has been imbued with the same principles, and I do not say that in any idle way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsequent dialogue which occurred between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ambassador and  Sir Garfield  Barwick proved that America put a different interpretation on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1963 a spate of books has dealt with various <span class="highlight">United States</span> Presidents - Kennedy, Johnson and now Nixon - and just how they arrived at decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody in his right mind would say that the enormous power which the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  exercises should be unfettered by any checks and balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What more or less brought the <span class="highlight">United States</span> into top participation in Vietnam was the Bay of Tonkin incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after three or four years when America began to look at the situation it was questioned whether there had been over-reaction by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> fleet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has noticed that attitude would agree that we do not know when that may happen with the present  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any Australian should take a jingoistic attitude but Australia has never had to grovel for any economic favours from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as probably Turkey has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be someone higher up such as the present Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or  Dr Kissinger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether in Australia, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or Great Britain it has become a regular thing for pressmen to anticipate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> if a Democratic convention is being held they anticipate whether this will make the country more isolationist and whether that will affect Australia’s relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Great Britain are concerned, the day has long gone when we adopted a colonial posture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">United States</span> knows this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think that one of the best clippings to read is the report of the farewell dinner whenever a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador goes home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all heard the abuse that has gone on between the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Kremlin and Peking; yet I wonder how many of the Opposition senators think about it when they see the  President  and his envoy talking amicably to the Russians and the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the outcome would have depended not only upon the Australian Prime Minister; obviously the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would have had the prime responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact even the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was ahead of it in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2, <span class="highlight">United States</span> installations in Australia, ministerial statement - a statement read to this House by the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Bishop)  on behalf of the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> installations statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Mulvihill  said: ‘We will get cooperation from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the imperfections of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, it should be remembered that that country played a significant part in winning the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nations of the world owe their growth and position to the great contribution of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which, in fact, has crippled itself in its overseas balances in so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the world sneered at the British in the old days when they carried the responsibility that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> carries today, just as some people of the world today and members of the Australian Labor Party sneer at the Americans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Australian people should understand the significance of the appointment by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government of  Mr Marshall  Green, a remarkably able diplomat of senior status, beyond ambassador to ambassador at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly, that man is coming to Australia because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> fears that what this Government is doing in Asia is creating chaos in the area and undoing the good of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me test these statements: Has the ALP said, whether in the Barnard version, the Willesee version or the caucus version, that it has looked at this base, that it is a threat to Australia, that it does not involve a question of dialogue with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or any other nation, that it must be removed from Australia because it is a threat to Australia or that it is an aggressive, dangerous war machine? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All data available to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government from these facilities is available to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator’s remarks are irrelevant to the subject matter before the Senate tonight which is that the Senate take note of the statement by the Minister assisting the Minister for Defence in relation to <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has introduced a law - it is conditional now - which is to come into effect some time in the next few days and which will entirely prohibit the import of kangaroo skins or kangaroo products into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Government of Communist China has consented to the exchange of official representatives with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America without exacting the slightest concession in regard to the recognition by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of the Nationalist Chinese regime in Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Overseas Trade concerning the recent devaluation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar and the Australian Government’s standstill policy on the Australian dollar, which has placed many of Australia’s export industries at a disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These acts which were allegedly committed by  Mr Burchett  but which apparently did not offend the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration or  Dr Kissinger  because  Mr Burchett  was invited to confer with  Dr Kissinger  on these matters- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Liberal Party can take that into account and convert themselves into a genuine liberal party, for which there is a role in any society, or they can take up the suggestion that has been put forward tonight by the absent Leader of the Opposition, who does not appear to be paying a very keen interest in this debate, that the only people who were critical of  Senator McCarthy  were the communists and that the only people who did not have faith in  Senator McCarthy  were the communists when the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate itself censured  Senator McCarthy,  including the late  President  Johnson, who was one of the sponsors of the motion of censure of  Senator McCarthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Minister to the statements issued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government on 14th March, that it was using every means of communication to express concern to Hanoi about the heavy flow of troops and equipment into Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam, and specifically that the confirmed movement of about 30,000 troops, 300 armoured vehicles and heavy artillery is expressly contrary to the Paris cease-fire pact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why does the Government still allow Qantas Airways Ltd to disregard the interests of travellers by its refusal to permit cheaper air fares by the system of advanced bookings on the most popular direct Sydney-London route whereas it allows this system for travellers to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Barnard  has made the statement that he feels that, while we accept the aircraft, we should be in the market to make some arrangements having regard to the fact, as I have pointed out to  Senator Drake-Brockman,  that this aircraft will go out of the production line in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in about a decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I use the expression ‘physical persecution’ in the sense in which it has been interpreted in section 243 (h) of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Immigration and Nationality Act of 19S2 under which the AttorneyGeneral of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is autho rised to withhold deportation of an alien to any country in which, in his opinion, he would be subject to physical persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have indicated the traditional and accepted rule - applicable not only in the past in this country but also in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom - that deportation or extradition does not take place where a person is likely to be dealt with for his political opinions by the country to which he is sent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister is aware that the postage rate for an airmail letter to Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is 30c Australian but that the cost to a Canadian to post a similar letter to Australia is 15c of a smaller dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Defence recall a statement made by the present Minister for Defence last October in which he talked about the Royal Australian Air Force having what he chose to call a pretty good run in the purchase of top drawer and top price aircraft from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I have heard the statement that there will be consultations between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities and the Trades and Labour Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this concern is a decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Tariff Commission that imports of canned Bartlett pears from Australia will become subject to special dumping duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently this decision was the result of a Tariff Commission investigation which found that the pear canning industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was likely to be injured by reason of imports from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently a complaint was filed by Pacific Coast Canned Pear Services Incorporated of Seattle, Washington, in 1971, and the matter was investigated by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Treasury Department in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia sent representatives of the industry to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and these representatives were giving evidence to the Tariff Commission at a time when 3 Ministers of the present Labor Government decided that it was within their province to criticise the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Ministers went out of their way to be abusive to  President  Nixon and to the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So at that critical time when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was adjudging whether any duty would be imposed on Australian canned pears, it could well have been impaired by the fact that 3 senior Ministers of this Government - although I believe there are no senior and junior Ministers in the Labor Government; all are of equal status - expressed a united view which could have been taken to represent the view of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Thursday 15th March 1973,  Senator Greenwood  asked me the following question without notice: 1 refer the Minister to the statements issued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government on 14th March, that it was using every means of communications to express concern to Hanoi about the heavy flow of troops and equipment into Laos, Cambodia and South Viet-Nam, and specifically that the confirmed movement of about 30,000 troops, 300 armoured vehicles and heavy artillery is expressly contrary to the Paris ceasefire pact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is aware of the statements issued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government on 14th March, and subsequently also, of course, of President Nixon’s comments at his news conference on 15th March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he investigate the operation of this equipment, as it is said that highly confidential and top secret information prepared by this equipment is constantly monitored by certain quarters in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he say whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> controlled communication base operated in Australia could be used to relay this information to a foreign power, namely, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that such a committee would repeat in Australia the worst features of those congressional committees in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which have been inquisitorial, which have inflicted hardship on individuals and which have struck at essential civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the former is the case it proves what  Senator Murphy  and all of us have said, namely, that senior people have been using Australia as a base to go to Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to foment trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think it is well known world wide that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is considering at the moment the drafting of legislation which will overcome the objections of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court to capital punishment as expressed in its decision of June, last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that could madden one but really saddens me is that the proponents of abolition, who project themselves as men of great conscience, integrity and all that sort of jazz, have completely distorted what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court said in its judgment of June last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is generally said that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court held that the death penalty was unconstitutional because it was a ‘cruel and unusual punishment and therefore offended against the Constitution’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to what occurred in the State of California in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America during the last presidential election when there was a poll in that State to determine whether or not the death penalty should be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opinion expressed in California in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America must have shocked many people who felt that the trend of thinking amongst the electorate at large was in favour of the complete abolition of the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think with that decision in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> must be taken the opinion which was expressed by  President  Nixon when he recently announced that he would ask Congress to restore the death penalty for aircraft hijacking, kidnapping, the throwing of fire bombs, attacks on prison guards or other police officers, and treason and other war-related crimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that for my part I wonder whether the Australian community might not reflect the attitudes which  President  Nixon believes ought to prevail in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and which the people of the State of California indicated by their vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>whether the question of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> duty of25 cents per lb on greasy wool could be taken up in the multilateral trade negotiations, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the intention is that the negotiations should be wide ranging there is no reason why the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wool duty could not be taken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The achievement of peace in Indo-China, if peace comes, may well focus attention on the future stability of Thailand and the position of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in Thailand and its future maintenance or otherwise of air forces or ground forces in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the answer could well be that it was when the Soviet Union had obtained land accommodation in Cuba, within the area of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and set out to mount missile landing weapons on that piece of territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that stage there probably was not one Soviet soldier within 5,000 miles of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but the position was so critical that America had to go to the brink of war and deploy her fleet in the face of the advancing Russian missile carrying ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, all that was necessary to bring the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to that parlous condition was that some power not friendly to her had managed to establish land accommodation in a strategic position which rendered the <span class="highlight">United States</span> geographically vulnerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence was clear before one’s eyes that there was massive devastation of areas inhabited by civilians which could come about only as a result of the deliberate action of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force in setting out to exterminate a civilian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was not one dissenting voice from any Western journalist or diplomat or any neutral diplomat or journalist that what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had attempted in North Vietnam during the bombings of last December was the deliberate extermination of the civilian population in Hanoi and Haiphong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> did it because it thought that by doing so - and this is what  Senator Hannan,  this other great Christian, thinks - this was the way in which to get people to sign the peace agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was in Hanoi shortly before the Paris peace treaty was signed, and I was assured not only by officials of the North Vietnamese Government but also by diplomatic observers and journalists who were there, that if the bombing had had any effect at all it was almost to remove the possibility of a peace agreement ever being signed because the response of the Vietnamese people was one of complete abhorrence of what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was doing to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Gair  asks me, in the first place the aggressor was the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which deliberately breached the Geneva Agreement of  1954  which provided that there should be only a temporary territorial division between North and South Vietnam and that free elections should be held no later than  1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and its puppet Ngo Dinh Diem whose murder the Americans subsequently engineered who sabotaged- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Little  is not aware of the public knowledge of the role which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> administration played in the murder of Ngo Dinh Diem then he must be one of the few people in the world who is not aware of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> deliberately destroyed the effectiveness of the  1954  Geneva Agreement and engaged in aggression in support of Ngo Dinh Diem and his regime which it created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me, the reason why it did occur is that in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America a change in foreign policy occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the reasons why he did not was that he had a very effective general in charge of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army who had been the GOC in Korea after General MacArthur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a time in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> when one lone senator, who later became an illustrious  President, Senator J.  P.

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> was realistic enough not to apply sanctions to us in relation to meat quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the basis upon which people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, people of Australia, people of New Zealand and people of virtually every community in South East Asia were prepared to go to the support of a beleaguered South Vietnam to resist aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Early this year when the bombing of North Vietnam was taking place - that bombing was the real cause of the North Vietnamese ultimately coming to the conference table -  Dr Cairns, Mr Uren  and  Mr Cameron  were condemning  President  Nixon and the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1954 the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had already invested 2.3 billion dollars in assisting the French to fight Ho Chi Minh because John Foster Dulles believed (and said) that the extension of Communist control to all of Vietnam, whether by elections or any other means, would endanger the entire ‘Free World’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent study of Saigon archives conducted from Cornell University concludes that the massacre is  a  myth and ‘the result of a deliberate propaganda campaign by the South Vietnamese and <span class="highlight">United States</span> Governments’ (‘The Myth of the Bloodbath,’ published by the International Relations of East Asia Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That it is a risk to the Australian Government was indicated by the attitude that we took, in alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in trying to stem that invasion at the expense of Australian servicemen and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister slate that the mining industry had shown foolishness and business naivete in writing mineral contracts over the past decade in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars; if so, in what currency or currencies should such contracts in the past have been written, particularly during the long period when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> currency was a very strong and appreciating commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of the 1969 study by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Bureau of Standards which revealed that various components of commercial aircraft, including seat cushions, ceiling panels, draperies and plastic trays, when exposed to intense heat, give off highly toxic gases, lethal in impact on humans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that an eminent toxicologist,  Dr G.

    <p>Is it not a fact also that in the Agreement signed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in Paris in March this year the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam has a status equal to that of the Saigon regime headed by  President  Thieu and is so regarded by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the 11 other signatories to the Paris Agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This fact was recognised at Paris where the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and South Vietnam sat around the table and negotiated the Vietnam peace settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a recent Press report which emanated from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and which indicated that many deaths from poisoning have resulted from air crashes because of the types of internal furnishings used which, when burnt, emit fumes of the deadly poison cyanide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether the same procedures were followed in this matter in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where I see that some similar sealing of files took place in .the last day or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he reject the facts which are set out by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government in its note - from recollection of 23rd April this year - which detailed the aggressive acts, including the movement of troops, the movement of materials and the movement of munitions in breach of the cease fire agreement, committed by North Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he not consider that his patronage of the North Vietnamese delegation and the Vietcong delegation is a calculated snub to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator referred to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> note in which certain facts were referred to as the viewpoint of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a growing awareness of a world energy crisis, and major industrial nations such as Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, having depleted seriously their available resources, and being already heavily dependent on imports, particularly of crude oil, are now turning to ‘resources diplomacy’ to provide for their future needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include institutions which are specifically involved in assistance to small business, such as the German Management and Productivity Association (RKW) of the Federal Republic of Germany; the Small Business Administration of .the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; the Smaller Enterprise Agency of Japan; and the industrial liaison scheme in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular it is argued that the current instability is largely a by-product of the continuing <span class="highlight">United States</span> balance of payments deficit - a deficit which reached the astronomical proportions of around $US30 billion in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, it is said, should have taken earlier action to correct the deficit by slowing down internal inflation for example, by curbing capital outflow, by devaluing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar, or by some combination of these policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important fact is, of course, that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> now has taken significant steps to correct its balance of payments deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government did take firm action domestically and this reduced its rate of inflation below that of nearly all major developed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the <span class="highlight">United States</span> agreed  to  devalue the dollar by approximately 8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The large <span class="highlight">United States</span> deficit on current account continued, as had been expected, into 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in addition there was no net inflow of short-term funds to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during 1972 as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was then, on 12th February 1973, that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> took a further decisive step by unilaterally devaluing the dollar another 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a general wish that effective convertibility of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar into other reserve assets should be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> had of course formally ceased to maintain convertibility of the US dollar into gold and other assets as from 15th August 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This led to suggestions for what is technically called a ‘reserve asset settlement’ scheme, lt implies that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should once again receive primary reserve assets if it is in surplus, and should lose them if it is in deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could assume such a ‘convertibility’ obligation, it was suggested that excess’ holdings of US dollars, and for that matter sterling, should in some way be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection a technical group was appointed to consider a <span class="highlight">United States</span> proposal that a system of ‘objective indicators’ be . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Japanese people would acknowledge themselves that certainly by their own extraordinary energy, intelligence and initiative but equally by the enormous help of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America as well as with the very great goodwill of other countries, including Australia, Japan has been able to reach a state of great prosperity, great affluence and great influence in this world, whether it be for good or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just so long as Western Europe, Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have a single interest in peace keeping in this world, the abilities, the resources and the knowhow of those three great nations and groups of nations will ensure peace, and Japan can be an interlocking linch pin in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second reason is that as early as 1956, on the first occasion that 1 went to Eastern Europe, I was very pleased to meet men in their 60s and 70s who had given the best years of their lives in the big steel mills in Pittsburgh in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, many of whom had gone there as young men and had remained unmarried, who had come back at the age of 66 or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thanks to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> social service system, they were able to enjoy a reasonable standard of living in the last few years of their lives in their homes in Eastern European countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was patently clear that all the ethnic groups represented there were demanding that Australia put its hand on the tiller, like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and not wait for these direct agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to note the attitudes now being strongly presented in Great Britain and in certain States of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, where the death sentence has been abolished, to see that there is a great clamour for its reinstatement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this mean that returns to Australian wheat growers in future will be determined by world prices and that the Australian wheat industry, irrespective of the effects of rising costs of production over which the industry has no control, will be competing with highly subsidised exporters such as Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not share the opinion that members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court are conservative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that may be so according to <span class="highlight">United States</span> standards, according to our standards probably the most conservative of the United Status Supreme Court judges would be regarded as something of a wild radical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, the distinguished Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> made a decision that was novel and a signal contribution to the thinking on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a definite tendency today, both in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in the United Kingdom, for a reversion to capital punishment because of the increase in crime and because so many people in the community pay so little regard to human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the Senate - this is absolutely pertinent to the situation - of what was said in the Warren Commission report in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America after the death of John F. Kennedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the other day I read about a chap in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who killed his mother and cut her into pieces and also killed about 6 other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has called for the restoration of capital punishment and in the United Kingdom, although the parliamentarians once again squibbed it as they so often do on issues they are afraid of - many of them are weak when it comes to grasping that nettle firmly - there is a rising demand for the restoration of capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What scares me about this proposition is that we could arrive at the position that has been arrived at in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom, where the death penalty has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>F believe it is a fact that half of the Stales of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are considering measures to bring back capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will go down the scale, as the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why does the Government still allow Qantas Airways Ltd to disregard the interests of travellers by its refusal to permit cheaper air fares by the system of advance bookings on the most popular direct SydneyLondon route whereas it allows this system for travellers to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all fares for international air travel set under the International  Air  Transport Association are in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars and as the Australian dollar has  been  effectively revalued against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar twice in recent months, when will Qantas Airways Ltd, which is wholly owned by the Australian Government, be reducing its fares in accordance with the changed value of the Australian dollar? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Has the Government considered the terms of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> note of 24th April, which was delivered by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to the other members of the International Conference on Vietnam, charging Hanoi with violations of the Vietnam peace agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although Australia is not a party to the ceasefire agreement, will the Government make representations to Hanoi in support of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> claim with a view to bringing diplomatic pressure on North Vietnam to honour the ceasefire agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware of the attitude that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is taking on the violations of the ceasefire agreement in the Indo-China states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister for Defence,  Mr Barnard,  flew in an F1 1 1 aircraft when on a visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America some time ago and that since then he has never really criticised the Fill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that when  Mr Barnard  last visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> he flew in the aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the arrival date, the first ferry from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is expected to take place late this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to his answer to my earlier question about the Government’s attitude to the Note from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the Hanoi violations of the ceasefire agreement and his own statement of the Government’s awareness of accusations by both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and the Hanoi Government of breaches of that agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask: Does the Government accept the specific and categorical denial of the accusations made by Hanoi which is contained in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government’s Note7 If so, why is not that denial, together with the evidence of the many breaches by Hanoi of the ceasefire agreement, sufficient to persuade the Government to use its diplomatic influence with a government - the North Vietnamese Government - with which it claims to have friendly relations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that even the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which is known for its attitudes on this matter, has ever yet linked this condition to aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, it relates to this <span class="highlight">United States</span> Note on the Hanoi violations of the ceasefire agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how does it sustain that position in the light of, on the one hand, the Prime Minister’s protest to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government in January of this year about the <span class="highlight">United States</span> bombing of North Vietnam and the particularly virulent statements of condemnation made by several Ministers of the Government at that time and, on the other hand, the complete silence of the Prime Minister and those same Ministers at this time in the face of the obvious North Vietnamese aggression in that area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the bombing, a time when we believed that peace should be brought about in the Indo-China states, the Prime Minister did protest to the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a change may occur either because of  a  change in the par value of the Australian dollar, such as was made on 23rd December last; or because of  a  change in the par value or central rate of the foreign currency concerned such as occurred in the case of the pound sterling when it was allowed to ‘float’ in June 1972; or because of a change in the relative valuation of the Australian dollar and the foreign currency concerned as a result of differing consequences for those currencies of action taken in the case of other major currencies, such as the devaluation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar in February 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen a report in today’s Press of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> contract to supply 19 million tons of wheat to Russia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he say whether, as stated in the report, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is paying a subsidy of 47.5c a bushel to grain company shippers in connection with that contract? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any subsidy arrangements which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has made with wheat growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that the granting of any such subsidy has been because of prior agreement entered into with the wheat industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but I am not sure of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the scandalous revelations of what is known in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as the Watergate Affair’, where widespread bugging activities are alleged, what provisions have been made to guard against the possibility of buggers operating in party rooms - in Parliament House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister state in reply to a question I asked of him earlier today that he had no idea what subsidies the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and other countries grant to their producers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Leader of the Australian Country Party has asked me another question on this subject, I think I should quote one or two passages from a speech in Paris by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of Agriculture in order to give some indication of the thinking of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot more of his speech that I could quote to indicate that the suggestions by the Leader of the Country Party that it is only the Australian Government that is thinking in terms of a realistic policy towards the marketing and the prices of our primary products are incorrect: That is not an isolated attitude on our part; it is a policy that is being pursued actively by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration, the Canadian Government and also the New Zealand Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need only recall what happened in response to the remarks of 3 Ministers of the present Government when they attacked the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and its  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has no statement on Australia’s foreign policy yet been made to the Parliament; if so, is the failure to do so in any way connected with the rough treatment that the Government’s statement on <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ bases in Australia received from the left-wing  of  the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That officer subsequently had discussions in Washington with senior <span class="highlight">United States</span> officials and others concerning water and air pollution laws, the functions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Environmental Protection Agency and the operation of the National Environmental Policy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Maybe there are precedents in the Mother of Parliaments or in the Parliaments of the States or countries such as Canada or the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would make one exception for  Senator Dame  Nancy Buttfield who is overseas and who went overseas with our authority; she can have a permanent pair until her business in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is completed and she returns here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hannan  recently quoted from another journal, which was published in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and I advised him that if he thought that it was a responsible journal and that its statements had any concrete basis it was his duty to place the matter before the Government or the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the clear experience throughout the whole history of the arbitration system in Australia and our experience is similar to what happens in other countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, England and the other European nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the speeches made in the other place, as well as in the second reading speech made when this Bill was presented, references were made to the ruling of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and its stand on representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has not caught up with the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court ruled in February this year, in a case involving the State of Virginia, that it was not necessary in drawing boundaries for all electorates to bc equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, on the Federal Congress and Senate levels, there are discrepancies between electorates to the extent where, in the Senate, one member represents more than 7 million voters while another represents only 80,000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congress of 1968, one member for a Texas District represented 951,527 voters while another member for a district in Michigan represented only 177,431 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators opposite want further opinions I will give one by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court which was brought down in March 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court, in delivering the opinion of the Court in the case of Reynolds v. Sims in June 1964, the Chief Justice said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party, the expert and learned legal opinion of the High Court of Ireland and that of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, they have been recommended to the Parliament indirectly by decisions of the High Court of Ireland and the, Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to which I made reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that if this occurs it will further weaken the Australian Government’s position in any air traffic rights discussions with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> if alternatives are precipitously closed off? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Treasurer been drawn to a report that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> balance of payments deficit was $10,000m for the first quarter of the year and to the report that the price of gold has risen to over $100 an ounce? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the new and sustained pressure on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar and of the likelihood of a further devaluation of that currency, will the Government keep a close watch on the position to see that the income from Australia’s trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America will not be unduly affected, even if this means a devaluation of the Australian dollar? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, the Government will keep a close eye on trade not only with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but also with everywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think honourable senators on the Government side tended to quote <span class="highlight">United States</span> practices and decisions made there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> today a percentage of the order of 15 per cent variation from the quota is accepted as being ‘as nearly as practicable’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted that the Ambassador said recently that Australia could lose her exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> if she became too nationalistic or protectionist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is one area in which I am at great variance with the Government which has so rapidly and so ruthlessly cut off to a large degree old and proven associations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the United Kingdom and other allies and adopted so definitely new policies in which those who follow other than our democratic system of government have been paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I deplore the recognition of North Vietnam and East Germany and the hurt and harm done to our foreign relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> through quite objectionable and disgusting criticisms of the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and his personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Mining Industry Council has estimated that the February 1973 devaluation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar cost the 20 largest mining company groups in Australia $143.5m in gross revenue in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure relates to the revenue lost irrespective of the destination of the mineral exports, but it would largely relate to exports of iron ore and coal destined for Japan, the contracts for which are written in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although at present a  12  mile limit seems to be most widely favoured, Australia still asserts a  3  mile claim, as do the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and a number of other major countries, and Australia is therefore not bound to recognise wider claims by other states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A similar problem occurred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America with regard to the legislation over the tide lands oil, where there was division within the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as to whether the national legislature should have control of these matters or whether they should remain in the hands of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here I draw a comparison with the actions of one of the leading jurists of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Chief Jus tice Earl Warren ot the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court who is eulogised by honourable senators opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact 1 wrote an article for one publication and in it drew a parallel with the reforms of the Roosevelt era in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in respect of ethnic groups and of how those people flocked to the Democrats and returned a long series of Roosevelt administrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The future of Australia, at a time when a fuel crisis is developing in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and when the traditional source of supply of hydrocarbons is the subject of very delicate arrangements, with certain traditional practices being changed and the prices being under barter, is bright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada, Italy, or any country with any sort of economy of scale is looking to the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the economic field, in the past several years people have been puzzled by the recourse of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to a revaluation of its currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It became very difficult for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to trade internationally as she previously had been doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major contributory reasons for this has been the requirement that has developed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for the expenditure of huge sums of her own capital to import the necessary fuel and power to maintain, in particular, her transport industry and to allow use of all the private motor vehicles that are on the roads in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 refer to the contractual arrangements and agreements that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has with the oil nations of Arabia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Saudi Arabia and other countries in that area are supplying much of the fuel and power required by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking purely of the effect that this has had on the economy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and on the capacity of the currency of that nation to stand in the world in the same manner in which it previously was able to stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way they earn still further profits on the income that they have received from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation is forced upon the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by the necessity for it to purchase oil and fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> has come under the enormous pressures to which it has been subjected in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia does not want to reach the stage where, if the requirement for this type of fuel continues as the technologies of future generations develop, it will be reduced to the poverty state to which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has reduced itself by the lavish use of its own fuel resources to the extent that it has become so dependent on fuel imports from wherever those imports may be obtained in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one speaks about the preservation of natural resources one could even recall the turn of the century and the schism that split the Republican Party in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> when there was a changeover from  President  Theodore Roosevelt to Howard Taft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was like the big establishments in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>: As soon as they got their way they could not care less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One saw this with the private enterprise railroad giants in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> - the Union Pacific and the other lines - which did not care 2 hoots what the people wanted so long as their own small stockholders benefited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a particular reason for saying that because at the present time in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the Government is extracting from the natural gas industry and the oil industry a pretty sizable rake-off which is going into the celebrated Land Water Act which set up a repository of feed-back money to the States, be it for such a mundane subject as better sewerage treatment works, for conservation or the acquisition of vast tracts of forest land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has indicated quite clearly to me in letters that the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate towards more and more demands for conservation is that instead of the taxpayer having to pay for them, it will dig more deeply into the pockets of the big exploiters of resources, d have no doubt that under this Bill we will be able to keep a very effective hand on the tiller so far as the income from our natural resources is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to honourable senators a very effective journal called the ‘Lamp’ which I think is published by the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. That journal goes to great lengths to tell us that in the Gulf of Mexico levies are imposed on production by oil rigs and that the levies are used to buy more wet lands for- the bird life of <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see a remarkable thing when we again look at this parallel between Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Theodore Roosevelt era virtually very little was done about conservation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for more than 20 years until Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After his term there was a sag of interest until John Fitzgerald Kennedy became  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was talking about the resources of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is exactly what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> finds that it has to do now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find reference in that report to overseas experience in Europe, Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources states at page 276 of its report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969, the OECD Report on Pipelines in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Europe reported that:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether yon look at the United Kingdom where the Gas Industry is nationalised, or whether you look at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or Canada where the Industry is under private enterprise, in all cases you will find  a  Federal or central authority of reference and decision which we in Australia seem to be lacking at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History has undoubtedly shown, particularly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada, that great problems occurred as a result of the lack of uniformity of approach, the varying gauges of pipelines and the criss-crossing of pipelines throughout the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada, and it was necessary for those countries to establish both authorities and commissions to deal with the transmission of hydrocarbons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> would dearly love to have our brown coal reserves, to convert them in the manner I have described into other fuels and to transport those fuels through some of the pipelines that exist in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall his answering a question asked by me a few weeks back to the effect that when the new round of international trade and tariff talks begins in about September 1973 the question of the 25ic per lb duty on greasy wool entering the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could possibly be taken up with that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister: As time is running on can he give a categorical assurance that this matter will in fact be raised with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at these talks in an attempt to lift or reduce this extremely heavy impost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot give the honourable senator a categorical assurance but it is my understanding that the matter will be raised with a view to Australia perhaps getting more favourable treatment from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in relation to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was one man whose position gave him unique power to achieve these changes and I here gratefully acknowledge - as everybody with the welfare of the world at heart must - the pivotal role played by  President  Nixon in ushering in a new and saner phase in our relations with China; in clearing the way for more intensive commercial, scientific, technical and cultural exchanges between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and’ the Soviet Union, and thereby achieving a successful first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and in ending foreign intervention in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be overlooked, however, that equally important parts of our foreign’ policy have required not specific actions but continuing activity directed towards strengthening relations with Japan, India and the Association of South East Asian Nations, with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada, with Britain and the other members of the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maintenance of our alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> under ANZUS remains most important for our security, since by its very nature it has created and guarantees in the Pacific a zone of peace in which the peoples of the region have for the last 20 years been free to pursue their political, economic and social goals without fear of hostile intervention or attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the context of our attitudes to nuclear testing that the presence of 2 of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> installations in Australia should be seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force detachment at Amberley and the joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station at Alice Springs collectively possess technical facilities to monitor the testing of nuclear devices in the atmosphere, on the surface and underground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government still has certain reservations about the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Naval Communication Station at North West Cape and it is our intention to seek a renegotiation of the original terms of the agreement establishing this station in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to emphasise, however, that in our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as with all other nations we should not allow any single aspect of our relations to dominate our whole approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly true of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which has in the space of 20 years become dependent on foreign sources for more than 20 important industrial minerals in which it was previously self-sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mineral and energy imports currently cost the <span class="highlight">United States</span> some US$10 billion a year, and the trend towards growing dependence on imported supplies  of  oil was one of the key aspects of President Nixon’s recent statement on <span class="highlight">United States</span> energy policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator is well aware, that means that they are close m concept to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact, as has been alleged, that the Prime Minister is anxiously awaiting an invitation from the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to visit that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a fact, will the Prime Minister, as a step to improving relationships with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, publicly make amends for the abusive attack on the  President  by 3 of his Ministers earlier this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are things that can point to the way in which the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America have had short term experience of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom introduce short term policies with regard to prices and incomes? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> freeze in 1971 for 90 days did prove that inflation could come down in the short term, but immediately after lifting that freeze the inflation went up and, if looked at in the longer term, the freeze had no ‘effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to understand why it does not contemplate the price and wages freeze tried by what might be called conservative administrations in both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did halt rising prices for a limited time last year only to find that soon after this trend lapsed and the inflationary trend went on as usual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can do that, but it does not in any way do what the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America did, that is, to freeze both wages and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere in the world have these kinds of mechanisms succeeded; nor have the freezes that have been imposed in the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At his Press conference this week the Prime Minister restated his opposition to the presence of <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force units in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Will the proposed Australian coastguard which is to be set up for patrol and surveillance duties be modelled on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Coastguard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Vietnam he would have to negotiate, to some extent at least with the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the measure of his success, by humbling himself to get an official invitation to meet the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, is any criterion of his ability to succeed in international negotiations, I suggest that we should not send him to Vietnam or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always been very interested in this problem and I remember, when accumulating information of an industrial character on a project for which I was sent some 20 years ago to most countries of the world, looking at decentralisation particularly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where I spent 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the history of the world the <span class="highlight">United States</span> probably enjoyed the most rapid development prior to the discovery and establishment of our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> things vitally different from the circumstances under which we were trying to attain a type of decentralisation which, to some extent, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> already had attained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has its monsters such as New York, Los Angeles and other cities, but spread throughout the country are the types of centres that we would like to see in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, however, was discovered and developed at a slightly earlier period in time than was Australia - not all that much earlier but under completely different circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier immigration to this country took place, in an era of larger families which coincided with the tail end of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One will not find this ready acceptance of rapid transport in other parts of the world with the exception of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember doing some research into the banking structure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and noticing how specifically the banking structure that had developed there had accidentally assisted enormously the process of decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The banks had passed the stage at which they were issuing their own currency, a procedure which created so much confusion in the early days of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Loans are not so easy for people to obtain in those circumstances, and certainly were not in this country in its developing stage to the same extent as they were in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result of this <span class="highlight">United States</span> system, with its financial and banking structure geared the way it was, was an enormous help to the decentralisation of industry in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depite the fact that there are giant corporations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, I recall that 20 years ago as a visitor to that country - visitors were usually shown over the giant enterprises - I was astounded to learn that about 80 per cent of the total production of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was produced by plants which employed fewer than 20 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one saw, say, the General Motors plant and others one gained the impression that it was through such plants that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> produced all of its goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The population, as we all appreciate, will not develop naturally because of the circumstances of family life which have changed so much from what they were in the first stage of our development and since the major period of the massive development of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> when that country had an immigration rate similar to the one we might be running now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who migrated to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> from Europe usually had families, the minimum number of which ranged from say 4 to 6 and the maximum from perhaps 10 to 12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, who is the true  Mr Whitlam  - the person who in his recent foreign affairs statement strongly commended the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  for his visionary statesmanship or the person who now reviles him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall his Leader’s statement a few days ago in another place that relations between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had been strengthened by the Whitlam Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking from my own knowledge of the matter, all I can say is that in January of this year I visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and, on behalf of the Government, I attended the funeral of the late  President  Johnson and also had discussions with a number of <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government was completely cordial and cooperative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 found that the relationship between the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Government of Australia was all that one could hope for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator reflects upon the matter he might think that it is better for him not to endeavour to create any kind of discord between this country and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that our Federal Constitution in Australia varies considerably in many respects from that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, but there are sufficient similarities to make it desirable, in my view, to examine mutatis mutandis the setting up in this country of a Federal communications commission which would be completely responsible for the control of electro magnetic radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if one looks at the history of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and of Britain one sees that many of these battles have to be fought a second time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation,  Mr Charles  Jones, left Australia on Friday, 1 June, to attend the Transport-Expo at Paris and the European Conference of Ministers of Transport at The Hague, as well as to have discussions with officials in the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface I refer to the continued concern expressed by the Young Christian Workers movement and several <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australian churchmen at ruthless political oppression in Saigon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been a number of cases of heroin smuggling in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Asia in which large amounts of heroin have been recovered, and the Australian Customs authorities have participated heavily in the investigations which have led to the uncovering of these activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It reminded me of the observation made by the late Dorothy Parker, a wit of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know from the arguments which we have had about dual citizenship in Greece, Yugoslavia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, we are not able, by any law which this Parliament passes, to remove the legal effectiveness of laws enacted by a person’s country of origin when that person returns to the jurisdiction of his country of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its objectives have been achieved if one considers the situation, for example, in the United Kingdom and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where for many years the industry has been chaotic because no such agreement has existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that I challenge  Senator Wright  and all the other Opposition, speakers- to cite me an industrial stoppage in New South ‘ Wales or any other part of the Commonwealth whose duration exceeded the duration of the recent strike by the Pacific coast longshoremen in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might be a little hostile, along with my colleague  Senator Wheeldon,  about  President  Nixon; but if  Senator Wright  were the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> he would have put <span class="highlight">United States</span> Marines on to the waterfront on the Pacific coast and would have had all the strikers shot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, as a national government in a federation - this is a point which has been adverted to particularly in respect to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in connection with the ILO - are unable to determine whether particular requirements of conventions are being observed in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Proclamation, which followed an apparently lengthy examination by <span class="highlight">United States</span> officials of proposals by both importers and domestic <span class="highlight">United States</span> dairy industry interests, was presumably based on an official recommendation to the  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was made clear by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of Agriculture, Earl L. Butz, in a Press statement dated 30 December, that a global increase in the quota, to be filled on a first-come-first-served basis, was decided on because there was an urgent need for immediate additional supplies of skimmed milk powder for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I am not quite sure of the situation I understand that since that time and during the last few days the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has imposed what is in effect a rule nisi on the import into that country of kangaroo skins and products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For about 35 years - I cannot give the precise number of years at the moment - the wool grower of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has been protected by an enormous impost on imported greasy wool amounting to 25c per lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Senate was modelled largely on that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and territories in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have never been represented in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of Territory representation in the Senate, and indeed in Parliament generally, was the subject of considerable debate at the constitutional convention and also in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, on the Senate of which country our Senate was so closely modelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if we are to show clearly why we oppose this legislation we should have a look at the interpretation or the com mentary on the Convention debates by these very distinguished Australian constitutional lawyers and have a brief look, if time permits, at the report of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, particularly the 3 powerful minority reports which convinced Congress that territorial representation in the Senate should not be granted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We come now to the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where in 1967 the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary was asked to report on the advisability of having representation both in the lower House and in the Senate for the District of Columbia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He then goes on in his minority report, after quoting the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Constitution which is the same as our own, that is, equality of representation as between the States, to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress showed that these powerful arguments embodied in the minority reports were such that they defeated the proposal to provide Senate representation for the District of Columbia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr DEAKIN: Under territorial representation if it follows the plan of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as it probably would, territorial representatives would be entitled to peak in the House of Representatives, but not to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was an argument advanced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America when it was proposed in 1967 that the District of Columbia - the Seat of Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with a population of over 800,000 - be given representation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is an assembly of States and it is the deep concern of many of my colleagues that representation in the Senate by political entities other than States presents so fundamental a change of concept as to destroy the present constitutional character of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - 1 would like to report briefly on the recent overseas visit to Mexico of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  - the first by an Australian Prime Minister - to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and to represent Australia at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Ottawa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before  Mr Whitlam  went away there was no doubt that most Australians would have said that Australia’s most reliable friends - the countries in which we had the greatest trust - we’re Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For all the criticism which the Government now makes - it makes a lot of criticisms of the ineptitudes and the inadequaciese of the present Prime Minister’s predecessors - when  Mr Holt  went to Washington.when  Mr Gorton  went to Washington and when  Mr McMahon  went to Washington they were able to state positively on their return the assurances which they had received from the American  President  of the continued reliance which we could place on the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, of the continued reliance upon us which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was happy to have and of the friendship which was constantly maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister state, while in New Delhi, as reported in the press that ‘Never again are we going to be put in the position of finding ourselves siding with Britain, France, Portugal, South Africa and the U.S. while all of our neighbours are on the other side,’; if so, what were the occasions and what were the isues on which Australia sided with Britain, France, Portugal, South Africa and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia’s neighbours were on the other side in voting in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During his recent visit to India the Prime Minister made a statement to the general effect that, in the past, Australia had in the United Nations paid excessive regard to the voting intentions of the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and had found itself frequently in a different voting position from that of its neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has made it clear that, in the future, while not disregarding the voting intentions of the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia would ascertain the views of countries in the Indian and Pacific Oceans such as Canada, Japan, Indonesia, India and some of the African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Calley, a mass murderer who has destroyed women, children and babies is still living in comfort in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and being treated as a hero, I suppose, makes a mockery of all the pretentions of the rest of the world to introduce humanity into war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators can argue on and on, but the fact is that that proposition has been upheld in the courts of many countries, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam’s visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had been a success,  Mr Marshall  Green, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador to Australia said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen increasingly the breaking of the traditional alliances which Australia has held with the countries whom all Australians regard as our allies - with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, with Great Britain and, in our own area, with Singapore which is a flourishing, progressive and stable nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find the USA, which has long been our most effective ally, withdrawing from South East Asia on the basis that it will always be prepared to assist those countries which in their own interests will act to look after their defences; and we, from our point of view, are not taking that action which is likely to maintain the continued interest of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, for example, which more than any other country on earth has prospered from large scale migration over a long period of years, which has been consistently held up as an example of a country which has developed from migration and which has benefited from large numbers of citizens who have come into its citizen strength from a wide variety of countries, makes it perfectly clear what it expects its citizens to do when they embrace <span class="highlight">United States</span> citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the pattern which America has evolved over the years because there were many difficulties in a much more stable age than we have today when persons migrated to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and, in a variety of ways, found themselves subject to restraints and obligations which their homeland had imposed upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can understand the attitude of  Mrs Ghandi  who, at the United Nations through her representatives, said frankly that she would sign the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty if the nations which had nuclear arms- great nations like Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union- would guarantee to defend, if necessary with nuclear weapons, any country such as India or Australia which might be attacked by a country having nuclear arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have examined the situation in Europe today and have come to the conclusion that because the Soviet Union has the bomb, Great Britain has the bomb and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has the bomb and because they have had no guarantees from any of those countries that they will be protected or defended against nuclear attack, they have to defend themselves from nuclear attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was when he reached Washington that he began to show rather more promise: He needed to, of course, because he was starting with the handicap of strained relations caused by his senior ministers ‘ criticisms of American activities in Indo-China at the beginning of the year and his own somewhat truculent attitude towards the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every country in the world which has tried some stopgap measure to control inflation, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Great Britain, has imposed not just a prices freeze but a prices and incomes freeze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who are fortunate enough to be able to produce meat for export, particularly for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market, are the ones who will have to bear the brunt of the whole of this tax and who will have the price of their product reduced accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although this contrast favours a policy of compulsory restraint, it should be borne in mind that the voluntary policies attempted in Canada in 1970 and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the period of the Kennedy Administration were extremely low key and a more vigorously applied voluntary program might prove more successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two American Cabinet Ministers- that is the nearest approach I can get to their status- have indicated to Russia that arrangements, presumably made with  President  Nixon when Brezhnev was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> recently, might well not be carried out unless there was some liberalisation of the condition of dissidents inside the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be brought to the attention of the Senate that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the  President,  on 12 March this year, was forced to take certain actions in relation to the problem of meat prices in his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was clear as the evidence unfolded before the Committee that it was the domestic meat situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which was the major contributing factor towards the demand for meat and the increase in the price in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and, consequently, the increase in the domestic price in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the problem of meat prices in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> one would have thought that we might have expressed some concern at the dilemma which the American Government was in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that in the last week or so there has been some drop in the general price of meat in this country because already the cattlemen who withheld their supplies from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market are now beginning to sell their products to the saleyards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prices are a world-wide problem and although no shortages have developed in Canada, there were shortages in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as a result of that Government’s price freeze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some evidence in relation to the domestic situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and of perhaps a recognition by the industry that it has to concern itself with the domestic market, which is the principal part of the productive process of meat in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We say in our recommendations that if American livestock producers continue to withold stock from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> domestic market immediate action should be taken to impose quotas on Australian beef exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators that there is any number of Press cuttings here which show that that is precisely what the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In drawing a parallel between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and our own situation the honourable senator talked more of short term price freezes than the recommendations which have been provided by the Government members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we cannot be sure that the exporter will not pass some of that tax on to his customer in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan and the United Kingdom, or in the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee’s third recommendation that if producers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America continue to withhold stock from the domestic market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America immediate action should be taken to impose quotas on beef exports to that country is another recommendation which drew dissent from the nonGovernment members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would also create a situation which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could point to should the market position change and should import quotas be reintroduced by that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Barnard  has negotiated agreements which come within the concept of joint exercises at home and abroad with our allies in South East Asia as well as with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As most people know, there are day to day talks between the navies of various countriesfor example, the navy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the navy of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are on speaking terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that it appears that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have reached a degree of co-operation and understanding that did not exist previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true also that there has been some measure of understanding reached between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has developed in place of the former bi-polar system involving the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The balance between the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, China, the Soviet Union and Japan- the quadrilateral in our region- is far from clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Nixon Doctrine leaves no doubt that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will not again engage in Vietnam-type intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I might add that it shares intelligence information with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I fail to see on what basis it is said in the matter of urgency that our credibility as an ally has been affected, because both Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are still sharing intelligence information with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Well, I do not know; but we have to rely on what has been mentioned not only here but also in other places, and it has been said that we share this information with Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British have withdrawn to all intents and purposes, so there has been an understandable contraction of <span class="highlight">United States</span> influence and involvement in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer not only to the cold war between the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, its allies and appendages, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but to a time when the divisions between the USSR and the People’s Republic of China had not become as apparent as they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time there have been Navy to Navy talks between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Royal Australian Navy- something which never took place during 23 years of conservative government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who feel, as I think members of the Opposition feel, that it is important that there by trust between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there can be any doubt that, just as our participation in that war was used by aggressive elements in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to justify their position, so our withdrawal from that war had an influence on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government in ending its participation in the war in Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why there have been negotiations between the Administration of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Government of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Japanese economy and the use of her electronics industry, her shipbuilding industry and her capacity to produce all the articles required in war are the key to the success of any war in the Indian Ocean region, in the same way as the military strength of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in this area may be the key to countries respecting Australia’s peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whatever we think about the Soviet Union and whatever we think about the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, there is no doubt that the relationships between those 2 great powers will have a great deal to do with the sort of lives that we and our children will live in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever we may think of  President  Nixon, there is no doubt that over recent months negotiations designed to produce a real detente between the great rivals in the world- the Soviet Union and the United Stateshave been in train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understandably, there is in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as there is in the rest of the world, a justifiable concern with what I believe are clear-cut manifestations of repression of opinion by dissident intellectuals in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to learn to live with it, just as the Soviet Union has to face the fact that it has to learn to live with the capitalist <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope, as I said when I got to my feet, that everybody who speaks in this debate will speak responsibly, will speak without hate and will speak with a knowledge that we can no longer afford the luxury of just sounding off about what we do not like in the Soviet Union or, if it comes to that, what we do not like in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that at present there is a growing detente and a so-called closer relationship between the governments of the Western world, in particular the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and the Government of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, whilst the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is stating these things as objectives of detente- of this closer relationship- as it seems the position in terms of growing contacts with Russia at the same time we are finding a clamping down in the Soviet Union of any movement for freer contact, freer information and the interchange of it amongst the Soviet intellectuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When will Qantas Airways Limited be reducing air fares in accordance with the effective revaluations of the Australian dollar against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar that took place last December, and earlier this year; if not, will the Minister please advise why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the letter written by Andrei Sakharov to the Congress of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America appealing to it to black trade concessions granted to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, unless that country allows the free emigration of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that in the hours immediately before the outbreak of war in the Middle East, the Israeli Government with <span class="highlight">United States</span> diplomatic help sought to avert hostilities, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there were amendments to the meat inspection regulations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America relating to the disposition of tuberculosis affected cattle and carcasses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These regulations were published in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on 4 February 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> requires that all meat from TB affected carcasses or animals which react to a TB test is to be used only in cooked products or is to be removed from abattoirs under conditions of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We received evidence  recently that there  will be a growing demand for beef in Europe, Japan, the Asian countries and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and that the future of the beef industry is very bright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This report goes on to say that the European, <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japanese markets are very buoyant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the same approximate period the <span class="highlight">United States</span> domestic price had dropped by nearly 30 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact there has been a steady decline on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market in the last month or 6 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that, we have had every indication of a falling market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to some comments that were made about the recent drop in meat prices in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that prices in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have fallen, but this has been due to a specific factor, namely, the fact that after the 12 September freeze had finished in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the primary producers of that country resumed their normal flow of meat on to the American market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate, noting reports that in the hours immediately before the outbreak of war in the Middle East, the Israeli Government, with <span class="highlight">United States</span> diplomatic help sought to avert hostilities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be concerned because the stability of any region in which the interests of the 2 super powers- that is, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics- are so vitally engaged must be of concern to nations such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in view of the fact that the war has now proceeded to the stage where the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union are supplying large quantities of arms to both sides, I ask whether it is not time that the Government should use its undoubted influence at the United Nations level and internationally to promote a ceasefire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, any kind of violence, and especially murder, would be disapproved of not only by everyone here but also by the trade unions of Australia which have a reputation of being free of the kind of violence and intimidation which has sometimes occurred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> when there has been infiltration from outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore we could expect that, allowing for changes that inevitably will take place in any system of law in a different country, substantially the system of the English common law will persist there as it has persisted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and that the guidance, legal knowledge and expertise of Australia will continue to be available to that country, whether in a general sense or through particular practitioners who will move from our jurisdiction to take their places in judicial and professional positions in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Health been attracted to a report on research in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which indicates some relationship between small-pox injection of children and multiple sclerosis in later life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole pattern of trade practices legislation in this country has been based more upon the English pattern than upon the <span class="highlight">United States</span> pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would say that all  Senator Murphy  visualises is the Ralph Nader syndrome in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was exemplified earlier this week when  Senator Cavanagh,  in reply to a question asked by me, illustrated in relation to the motor industry how we lagged behind the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in regard to safety devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America pioneered this legislation back in 1894. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> then adopted the punitive legislation whereby the criminal court or the penal sanction was made the agency of enforcement of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest information is that yesterday a joint resolution was put down by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, simultaneously while the Security Council was meeting, negotiations were going on between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the detente or because of some other better considerations for each other, Russia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were able at the same time to enter into negotiations to bring about a ceasefire as a preliminary towards peace talks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A miscalculation by either of the great powers involved- the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics- could easily have brought about a world war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well have been that, in the situation we have faced over the past several weeks, the unfortunate and unsettled domestic situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could have brought about a miscalculation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can imagine how those countries will try to exercise their oil strength, if I may use that phrase, to bring pressure to bear on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to cease support for Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that both the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were criticised together for the supply of arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, only when it was faced with Israel suffering attrition of its armour and weapons and with Russia beginning a massive airlift to supply the Arab states, began its very significant re-supply of Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not accept that a even handed policy blames the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the same degree as it blames the Soviet Union for the war in the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also believe- it is referred to in our foreshadowed amendment- that there must be an understanding and an agreement between the 2 major powers concerned, the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, that they will ensure that there is no massive rearmament and that they will adopt an even handed policy on both sides to ensure that peace is maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even if one were to argue that it was a mistake for the United Nations to decide some 25 years ago that Israel should be established as a state- even if one were to say that it should not have been done, despite the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Soviet Union and practically every country in the world voted for the establishment of Israel- it is too late now to say that it was a mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We can condemn the Soviet Union for providing arms to the Arab countries only if we condemn the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for providing arms to Israel because there has been a two-sided traffic going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has happened is that there has been a conflict of interest between the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with the Soviet Union supporting certain Arab countries and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> supporting Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that either the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or the Soviet Union is acting maliciously or endeavouring to create havoc or harm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well to condemn the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in this conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it was the Arab states that made the first move and it was the Soviet Union that assisted the Arab states before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> came in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to this conflict of interests, what specific interest has the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in supplying arms to Israel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is abundantly clear from the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada- both federations comparable with Australia- that a problem is not solved just by getting a decision from the courts as to where the legislative authority lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have thought that that expression, however extravagant, might in itself have caused the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to wonder whether the ANZUS treaty, which is vital to this country and to which the Government pays lip service, is now tenable and viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence taken from the 3 Service departments related mainly to inadequate checking of billings received from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> services for equipment and stores supplied which resulted in substantial over-charges of approximately $900,000 not being detected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I endorse the remarks of my colleague  Senator Milliner  when he paid tribute, as has been done by the Government and particularly by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  to our Senate colleague  Senator Dame  Nancy Buttfield, who was invited to go to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to play a prominent part in international discussions on the problems of the physically and mentally handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for the Media whether the increased level of interest about Australia in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which was very evident around the time of the election last year from the amount of space devoted to this country in American magazines, is being maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLANDFirstly, since the election of the Labor Government the Prime Minister has visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and as a result of that visit there was tremendous publicity for Australia in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Information Service of my Department has assisted some 65 or 70 publicists from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, all of whom have provided a high level of return in media coverage of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister may give some breakdown of this amount but here, if I am not mistaken, there is a proposed expenditure of $1,959,500 which is, I understand, for 3 works of art being purchased from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a few friends in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and every one of them has written to me, not criticising the art, but about the absurdity of the price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I refer to Soho in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> I am referring to where Hutchinson has his gallery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not one person in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who does not agree with that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one multiplies that amount allowing for the inflation that has occurred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as it has here- it is not quite as bad here as it is there- one gets an indication that some of these works are priceless and invaluable, not only from the point of view of their material worth but also for the fact that they are examples of a period of history or of a different interpretation of art. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLANDBecause of the developments that were taking place and found to be in existence in some parts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom I determined that this matter should be investigated in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the serious overseas fuel crisis necessitating drastic cuts in the use of hydrocarbon derivatives for power, heating and transport in the United Kingdom, Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, would the Minister press for a higher priority for bringing into use at the earliest possible time the known reserves of the North West Shelf and the Cooper Basin which would include the early commencement of the national pipeline grid in order to avoid the possibility of the disruption to industrial and social life that is high and growing in other parts of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Applying similar constitutional provisions, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court has, for the last 9 years and more, declared any form of malapportionment within a state to be unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple answer in both instances is that General Motors is not the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Australian Capital Territory is not Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Might I say by way of preface that I am intrigued to observe that there has been a return in recent days to the use of the name Cape Canaveral’, which was the original name given to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> base which later became Cape Kennedy to honour the name of that great <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  whose passing the world still mourns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not also true that the supply of arms by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to Israel was entirely necessary because it enabled that country to resist this aggression? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In both Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> we have had exactly the same thing occur as I am predicting will occur here: It has taken years and not even yet has the problem been resolved despite the fact that the decision to place the matter before the courts was made, I think, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> many years ago and was made in Canada about 6 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 10 to 15 years ago the Americans were drilling off the coast of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> only to a shallow depth, in some 100, 200 or 300 feet of water, but techniques have improved so much in recent years that even off the Australian coast some of our drilling ships are capable of drilling in a depth of 1 500 feet of water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was told at that time that what we are facing now had already occurred in America, namely, that the central Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had declared its right over various areas, although it had not declared its right over the territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as this legislation is concerned, the point brought out this afternoon in the debate which attracted my mind- I think  Senator Durack  was speaking at the time- related to legislation that had been passed in countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not solved the legal problems because I understand that more legal actions are being taken in that country than was the case before the legislation was passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Santa Barbara, or whatever place it is in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, was always quoted as a case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether he had the opportunity of talking to or receiving communications as I did from leading <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senators such as  Senator Muskie,  from the seaside State of Maine, or  Senator Jackson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mention also has been made of the fact that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada litigation has gone on for a great while because of challenges as to where authority lay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 m. At the same time this Government had representatives in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America negotiating the purchase of a painting which has committed the Government to an expenditure of $ 1.3m, plus commission of $100,000, plus the cost of insurance, transport and everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, when  President  Kennedy was in office, had to send Federal deputies into the southern States to make sure that justice was done and that coloured people were placed on the electoral rolls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I have been saying brings me back to the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where the Federal Government in Washington had to send deputies into the southern States to make sure that the Negroes got on the roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  campaigned in Federal elections between 1969 and 1972 the whole theme of his argument was that we should try to pitch a policy into the Constitution that was akin to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we as the Australian Government sound the tocsin, it is merely because of our appreciation of the need for reforms having seen what has happened so often in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government given any consideration to the compilation of a register of all professional lobbyists and making public the names of such lobbyists, which action would be similar to the action which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress had to take to publicise the work of all full time lobbyists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly overseas, in more places than the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, it has been felt that in the public interest something should be done about the registration of lobbyists, in their own interests as well as the interests of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface, let me say that three major sporting activities- namely, Korea versus Australia in World Cup soccer, the rugby league ashes series between Australia and Great Britain, which Australia won, and the recent Davis Cup final between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have been telecast direct to Australian audiences by satellite coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my dissenting report is perused- I had not looked at it for 10 years until I brought it in here and I had not thought of this remark- it will be seen that I quoted there that in its first 50 years of existence the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate was made light of and that jests were made that the senators could be found going to the House of Representatives to observe the proceedings there, and that they were insignificant and of no account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst revaluation of the Australian dollar has realised some savings in Qantas’ expenditure overseas, there has been a substantial reduction in the company’s revenue remittances on travel sold in other countries, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where currency changes have taken place in the past 12-18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net effect of these exchange gains and losses on Qantas’ operating account has led the company to the decision that it would not be economically feasible for adjustments to be made in international fares sold in Australia to take account of changes in the value of exchange rates between the revalued Australian dollar and other currencies, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of further elaboration ofthe foregoing explanation it should be said that changes in the relative values of major currencies, including the devaluation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar and the floating by the United Kingdom of the pound sterling which are two of Qantas’ largest markets, has resulted in a decline of approximately $A 1 3m in the company’s revenue from air travel sold in foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is relevant to mention that Australians are among the few travellers and shippers in the world who are paying the same fares and rates as last year whereas fares and rates in some countries, of which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom are prime examples, have increased by more than 10 per cent as a result of currency changes and general fare increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>international air fares are established by the IATA in two basic currencies, sterling and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar, which have been chosen as a matter of convenience and because of their past stability within the international monetary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year fares sold in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for travel to Australia have increased by 10 per cent and United Kingdom pound sterling fares have increased 6 per cent with the further 4 per cent to be added in November to normal fares for travel originating in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of these increases an excursion fare purchased in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for travel to Australia which cost US$833 in January this year has increased to US$9 18.80 today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that 2 members of the organisation,  Dr Lacey  and Father Keogh, recently were invited to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to advise people there on how to go about setting up a similar organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the penalty imposed is a fine of US$100,000, which is $A67,340, or 1 year’s imprisonment or both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing that stands out in the international field today it is the fact that although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America huffed and puffed about its objection to some of the decisions taken by Latin American countries in regard to their territorial sea limits, that country has learned to live with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I often wonder whether a great number of the troubles in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which are currently before the people of the world are not in some sense attributable to the complexities and the delays in the legal administration and judical system generally in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we may agree with the arguments advanced by the Minister in regard to revaluation of the Australian dollar, the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar has recovered to a certain extent has meant that in Great Britain, which is the main market for this industry, there has been a currency revaluation of about 3 to 4 per cent, so there is justification for money to be spent on currency revaluation compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission’s Report of the Special Study of the Securities Markets took several years to complete with a staff averaging 65 people, of whom half were lawyers, economists, analysts and investigators working full-time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time, that action has been very mild compared with the campaigns of economic boycotts and sanctions which were carried out for almost 2 decades against the Soviet Union and against the People’s Republic of China, largely at the behest of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To a large extent the major difficulties between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Soviet Union, and perhaps to a lesser extent between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and China, have been resolved as a result of some of the initiatives taken by the major powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although obviously the most serious and most disastrous thing that could happen to the world would be a third world war, particularly a nuclear war, at the same time it would be a rather grim prospect for the people of the world if the consequence of the relaxation were to mean that the Soviet Union was free to send its tanks into Czechoslovakia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was free to send its marines into the Dominican Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to see that we have our own independent policy, our own desire to assist our own people by an independent national policy, and that we work to see that there is no foreign intervention in any country either by the Soviet Union, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have a rather dismal record over the past 20 years of interventions and invasions in other peoples’ countries and of efforts to impose their form of economic system and their domination on other countries- the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in South East Asia and Latin America, and the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aborigines find themselves in somewhat the same position as the negroes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America who were deluded into believing that the passage of a law would give them freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I came back from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> after attending the United Nations 3 years ago, I was running around telling people that the situation in America was shocking; that one had to pay $5 for a leg of lamb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very fine to have kick at the Government about this matter, but it should be remembered that Australia still has a private enterprise economy, as have the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the European common market countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was amazed at the Government’s reaction to the announcement of joint United Kingdom-<span class="highlight">United States</span> proposals to upgrade the facilities at Diego Garcia- to extend the runway by 2,000 feet and to provide refuelling and other facilities for naval vessels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, we may be all right for 3 years but there only has to be another brush up in the fuel crisis and a few other Middle East episodes with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and we could be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that, under the terms of the Australian Government’s assistance program, the Australian Softball Federation will be eligible to receive a subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the cost of fares to assist with expenses involved in sending the Australian softball team to compete in the world series in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the possible danger to our ANZUS Treaty relationships with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and New Zealand, will the Minister give an assurance that the Russian overtures will be rejected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people apparently envisage a system of federal courts parallel with the State courts somewhat like the system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is often said that we should have a duplicate system because a similar plan was undertaken in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand the position, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> can supply the world with enriched uranium until the early 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, the householder being provided with natural gas is paying more for this fuel than would be payable if, as suggested to the Committee, a pricing formula for natural gas- irrespective of where it is produced- similar to that used by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America Federal Power Commission, were adopted in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he wants to have some learning on these matters, probably one of the most famous legal decisions in history was given by the great Chief Justice of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Chief Justice Marshall, on the matters of when appointments, commissions and so forth take effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In posing the question of great power rivalry what  Mr Whitlam  is in fact accepting is that absurd premise that it is permissible for Russia to increase its present naval presence in the Indian Ocean but it is outrageous for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to take a counter measure, no matter how modest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an ally of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, one would have thought that the Australian Government would have welcomed the decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to attempt to redress the balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Factors considered included international global developments affecting relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the strong interest of other major powers in the avoidance of conflict, and various developments nearer to home involving countries in our neighbouring region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we are all discouraged to learn that  Dr Kissinger’s  latest mission to the Soviet Union did not achieve the hoped for results and that the Russian position is obviously hardening, no doubt because of the domestic situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the disunity in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an absolutely extraordinary attitude for the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Senator Willesee,  a Western Australian Minister, to adopt by immediately attacking the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-United Kingdom agreement to extend facilities at Diego Garcia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has protested to both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Russia but I would have thought more of the Government if it had protested to Russia much earlier, when it was building up its naval strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These factors included international global developments affecting the relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the strong interest of other major powers in the avoidance of conflict, and various developments nearer home in and between the countries within our own neighbouring region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Sim  reminded us, in recent times who predicted that the Middle East conflict would break out again as quickly as it did and that the major powers, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America would nearly come into conflict? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Labor was in opposition and since it has been in government, the left wing of the Labor Party has opposed most vocally the proposal for the establishment of any foreign bases in this country, particularly for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, they are so inadequately developed that the Soviet Union is now calling in expertise from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, France, Japan and other countries because it has been so committed- this is my view, and I am stating it publicly- to the proposition of having huge numbers of” men in uniform that many of the resources which the Soviet Union could have been developing for the good and the benefit of its people were left undeveloped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances therefore are that while  Mr Whitlam  periodically asserts that Australia ought to be isolationist, he goes to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and pleads for the ANZUS Treaty and says that Australia will not be isolationist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the situation has become so serious that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Great Britain have agreed to the establishment of a base at Deigo Garcia facing the bases which the Soviet Union has acquired from some of the eastern countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Instead we have a mean and contemptible attack upon the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Great Britain for taking an action which is to our advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few years ago under the old regimes it would have been unthinkable that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America would have dared to talk or even suggested talking to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if a world war breaks out in this situation with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on one side and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the other side nearly every nation, and certainly Australians, Indonesians and the rest, will finally be dying in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could say to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America that we want it to count the ships every day and to have the same as the U.S.S.R., or perhaps 10 per cent or even 20 per cent more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not that it matters a great deal since the 2 super powers- the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union- have enough to overkill one another many times over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was negotiated, to his everlasting credit, by  Sir Robert  Menzies in 1951 when that great Prime Minister was able to secure for Australia from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a guarantee of protection in peace time, a guarantee which has been given to no other country in peace time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One hears talk of detente between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this situation can, in general terms be explained by currency ajustments, the cessation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> R and R program to Australia which terminated on 31 December 1 97 1 and in some cases by an uncompetitive fare situation from our major markets, there are no indications that the position is improving, nor can one be optimistic that it will improve of its own accord. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We sit here in this chamber, a chamber whose significance has been growing year by year and will grow until it more nearly approaches the ambit of power in the comprehensive jurisdiction of the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> if we accept the first principle of our existence, to guard and defend our own integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition I can tell the honourable senator, as I told the Senate last week, that there has been a tremendous response for these types of productions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in Mexico, so much so that in Mexico, as a result of a week’s productions being shown there, there has been a request for repeat performances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is visiting Australia at the invitation of the Australian Government I think it is relevant to remind the honourable senator that in this modern day and age  Mr Khrushchev  once visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and  President  Nixon visited the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it is all boiled down, the real crux of the issues centres around the point that we are offering universal coverage to the community- something that belongs in most countries today; something that is being introduced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America; something that has been established in Canada for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the adjournment debate that night a number of members of the House of Representatives paid tribute to  Mr Makin,  who was then Minister for the Navy, Minister for Munitions and Minister for Aircraft Production, on his appointment as Australia’s first Ambassador to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting to read how, after about six or seven speeches had been made,  Mr Makin  referred to his parliamentary life, what happened during his career, how he had enjoyed it, had gone on finally to Become the Minister for the Navy and capped his career by being appointed as Australia’s first Ambassador to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole of the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America today stands in doubt in the eyes of the world because of one question and one question alone and that is: Did those in high authority conspire to deceive the Congress? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude has been taken in other parts of the world, especially in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that the great corporations ought not to be permitted to interfere in political affairs and especially to use industrial disputes as a means of intervening in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A major feature of last October’s conflict in the Middle East from our strategic point of view was the manner in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union successfully managed the crisis in their relations and used their influence to limit the conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our alliance and working defence relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> continue important of course- in terms of the global balance, of our regional standing, of the long-term contingency of serious deterioration in our strategic situation, and of the maintenance of the capability of our defence force in several important practical respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we are now required by strategic and international political developmentsand we ourselves wish- to deal on our own with any local situations that may arise, to assert an independent strategic influence, and to pursue political policies more independently of <span class="highlight">United States</span> views and interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Defence Force Development Committee that we should, as the first step, acquire 2 destroyers of <span class="highlight">United States</span> design, known as the patrol frigate, and the Government has agreed that negotiations should be opened with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of new destroyers, which have the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy as the source, negotiations will be commenced with both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> foreign military sales organisation and <span class="highlight">United States</span> equipment suppliers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> early last January, I was able to re-affirm publicly in New York and privately in Washington, to the Secretaries of State and Defence, Drs Kissinger and Schlesinger, and to other senior members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration and the United. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> requires management, of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We entertain on our territory <span class="highlight">United States</span> installations whose presence and functions required the Government to satisfy itself that adequate regard was paid to Australian sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have this utter nonsense in the so-called defence statement about the Government’s concern over the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but the Government’s Ministers only 12, 13 or 14 months ago were calling the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and his people war criminals, butchers and all the rest of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we are waiting for the day when this Government, if it ever gets back, gulls the people of Australia into believing that perhaps we would get better equipment from the Soviet Union than we would get from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It brought the world to the verge of war, when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Mediterranean forces and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> nuclear strike force were put on immediate alert in response to a Russian threat to send divisions of troops to Egypt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee),  who is a Western Australian senator, announced that the Government was protesting to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was responding to the increased Russian naval strength in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must rely on bigger countries like the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to come to its aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the meantime  Senator DrakeBrockman,  as the Minister- and in that capacity he did a good job- was faced with recurring expenses associated with the need to send specialist investigation groups from the Royal Australian Air Force to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to muck about with the position and safeguard the interests of Australia in connection with the design of an aircraft which had not been properly developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are about to have an election and this Government is about to face its masters- and it is about to learn that the people of Australia want to belong to the free world and want to honour our alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and those ideals, practices and objectives which we have in common with the people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This last incident was one of the chain of incidents which has occurred from the time the Labor Government took office, from the time there was recognition of the Russian and Chinese supported government of North Vietnam, from the time at which 3 Ministers criticised the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and its President and therefore clearly aligned this Government with an attitude which was antiAmerican. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one is to accept what was rumoured in the newspapers, or leaked to the newspapers, if we had gone ahead with this it would have meant the end of the ANZUS treaty and an end to the alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as we have always known it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to remind the people of Australia that the vocal interjection by  Senator Wheeldon  is by an honourable senator who is on record as saying in recent weeks, if I can paraphrase it- he can correct me if I am wrong- that it would be good if we were to cut all ties with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, including the ANZUS pact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For what reasons did Australia move an amendment to the motion moved by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for a complete moratorium on commercial whaling, and what was the amendment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Australian Government took the position of supporting the <span class="highlight">United States</span> motion for a total ban. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment was carried by 13 votes to 2 and subsequently was supported by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement was made that the electronics companies engaged in the manufacture of colour television sets believed that there would be a heavier saturation of sales at the outset in Australia than occurred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada and Great Britain when colour television first came to those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the top 1 5 <span class="highlight">United States</span> oil companies today own 53 per cent of its coal production and, through a maze of subsidiaries, put their actual control of the commercial coal market at closer to 67 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By contrast, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, including Alaska, according to a recent report, approximately 1.8 per cent of offshore public lands had been leased by the Federal Government to the oil and gas industry as of January 1974, and these leases were accompanied by very substantial payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even allowing for the differences in leasing methods, this situation reflects the very different attitude taken by the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the management of the resources of that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not quite clear on the present position regarding the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but I know the attitude was being taken some time ago that if we were to relax this ban it would intensify its measures against the import of kangaroos skins or products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that they are because in the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in the case of Gray v.

    <p>To cite the <span class="highlight">United States</span> situation which has been mentioned several times by other honourable senators, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives is elected by a quota system as nearly as possible equal in each State but the Senate has 2 senators from every State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the State of Alaska has the same say in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate as the more populous States of California, New York State and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Both  Mr Daly  and  Senator Murphy  have argued that the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has declared that any form of malapportionment within a State is unconstitutional under the American Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there has been a development of doctrine in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America since the cases of Reynolds v. Sims and Westberry v. Sanders which suggests that if you do not have equal electorates you are denying to people the equal protection which the American Constitution vests in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what  Mr Daly  and  Senator Murphy  ignored was the most recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which had been given before these Bills were introduced in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That is a decision of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It makes nonsense and more of statements consistently made by spokesmen on behalf of the Labor Party to the effect that in some way what is happening in Australia is inconsistent with what ought to be the law as disclosed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us recognise that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court, applying a different constitution from that which applies in Australia has, in fact, held that a margin of at least 16 per cent is consistent with equal protection and equal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again I refer to the patience and tolerance which was used in securing additional statehood in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to feel that we can look across the Pacific at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and say: ‘Well, we gave our people much better service in the avenue of parliamentary representation than you gave to Alaska’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, our parliamentary system is similar in many ways to the system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is a Senate and a House of Representatives and there have been arguments about the Capital Territory there having representation in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the argument advanced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- this is a very important point, particularly in relation to our own legislation- when it was proposed in 1967 that the District of Columbia, the Seat of Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with a population of over 800,000 people, be given representation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal was defeated, and in dissenting reports on the proposal before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a quotation connected with the argument that was advanced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, the proposal was defeated, and in dissenting reports on the proposal before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary it was stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had said that the last quotation came from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Transport seen recent Press reports on the hearing of an injunction sought by Foremost International Tours against the Australian airline Qantas Airways Ltd in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> District Court in Honolulu? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would point out that the tour charges of Qantas are in conformity with International Air Transport Association regulations and have been filed with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Aeronautics Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Treaties with Austria, Sweden and Italy were signed in 1973 and one with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia joined the IBRD soon after it opened its doors for business in 1947 and has subscribed the equivalent of nearly US$640m to its capital stock, of which 10 per cent, or approximately US$64m in terms of current <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars has actually been paid in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>14m, allowing for the effects of the 2 <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar devaluations in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the latter sum, US$411,000 is payable in gold or <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars while the balance of US$3.7m can be paid in Australian dollars, either in cash in a single lump sum or in the form of a promissory note which would subsequently be encashed only as and when the IBRD required the funds involved, or else as otherwise agreed with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, the top 15 <span class="highlight">United States</span> oil companies today own 53 per cent of its coal production and, through a maze of subsidiaries, put their actual control of the commercial coal market at closer to 67 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These oil companies account for 40 per cent of the total milling capacity and 45 per cent of all known <span class="highlight">United States</span> uranium reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That company was, and is, in partnership with a <span class="highlight">United States</span> company in other areas off-shore from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we ought to take heed of what has happened in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada, which are 2 of the world’s great federations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This problem arose in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in the 1940s and, although the Congress of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was given the authority by a decision of the Supreme Court and although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress vested the power which the Supreme Court had conferred in that Congress in the States of the Atlantic seaboard, still that has not resolved the legal problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, as I discovered when I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> earlier this year, a vast area of grey still unresolved as regards the authority of the States and Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are a long way behind Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and naturally the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that context, many of us are quite disturbed at the attitude which the present Government has adopted and its failure to do something more sensible and positive about the relationship between Australia’s currency and its present linkage with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in my Party hold the view that the time is overdue for us to unhinge ourselves from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that as a result of meetings of some countries connected with the World Bank organisation it was decided that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America would grant, through the World Bank, up to US$400m per annum to Saigon for at least 20 years to aid that country’s economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems somewhat strange also that whilst the <span class="highlight">United States</span> government is content to pour aid, by way of the World Bank, into South Vietnam, there is no recognition by that government or in this Bill of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam- the Government that was recognised by the Paris agreements and a body that controls a rather extensive area of South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian aid has been utilised also to provide water supplies at Vung Tau, which previously was an American base and where I understand the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is now planning a major port development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact  Mr Justice  Kerr, after making an examination here some years ago, visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and England and then wrote to the Prime Minister of the day,  Mr McMahon,  pointing out that there was a tendency throughout the world for this interlocking situation to arise with people dealing with various types of salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I remind the AttorneyGeneral that as long ago as 10 January 1973 he made a public statement acknowledging the Government’s intention to introduce a freedom of information Bill along the lines of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Freedom of Information Act and detailed in his statement the major features of such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chief Justice Hughes of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court made this very point in an opinion he delivered in 1933 in the case of Appalachian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The discriminatory dealing provisions are based on provisions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation known as the RobinsonPatman Act, and commentators have been quick to note that that legislation has been the subject of some criticism in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this be correct, and if Australia is aligned with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> through the ANZUS Treaty, have the rules for membership of the Third World been changed or is Australia’s policy towards the ANZUS Treaty changing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Worse than that- I am now mentioning a personal communication to myself- a committee of a Parliament with a Westminister type of government, having looked at the telecasting of committee proceedings in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, wrote to me and said that the whole system is a disaster area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at the position in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which we seem to follow in many ways, we find that the costs of health care are enormous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe, in the words of the great Chief Justice Warren of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in 1964- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Prime Minister stood up here and lectured us, as he so often does, about democracy and about what that great Chief Justice Earl Warren said in the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, he certainly did not advert to the Supreme Court case of February 1973 involving the State of Virginia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, as many know, it was named after Governor Gerry of Massachusetts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America who approved an electorate which was so distorted to his Party’s advantage that it was in a peculiar shape, looking a little like a salamander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who drew up our Constitution felt so keenly about the representation of the people that they expressly did not follow the example of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate said that they believed that the people of the district, that is the capital District, should be represented in the House of Representatives but that, the Senate is the forum for the people, that is, that the Senate should represent the States from where the people come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a proportion of gross domestic product the cost of Canada’s health services is at this point about the same as in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, but I repeat that in Canada everyone is covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one had to make a comparision to decide which scheme the present Australian scheme was more likethat in Canada or that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- one would have to say that it was more like that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State governments can confirm- and it is evidenced by the most recent 50 per cent increase in hospital charges- that hospital costs are running away in this country under the present scheme and at a much faster rate, as it happens than in Canada or the United Kingdom or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America against which unfavourable comparisons are so often made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, if we follow the course of the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in mindlessly plundering our raw reserves or, what is worse, do what the parties opposite were doing and, in effect hand the reserves over to others to plunder, we shall deserve to sink to the same wretched position as other countries have found themselves in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the miners and I asked during 1971-72 was: If we reversed the situation, would the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government allow 2 companies from Australia to come to its country’s shores, mine coal entirely for export and then engage in competition for overseas markets to the detriment of local industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The experience of Great Britain, where it took 10 years to examine all the agreements which were put on the register in order to find out whether or not those agreements were consistent with the public interest, and the experience of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, where it took 20 years before they first found that there had to be some test of reasonableness in the otherwise broad restraints of trade which were laid down by the Sherman Act, are indications to Australia that we cannot expect to have effective legislation in this area unless we allow a suitable time to elapse in which the principles are formulated by the timehonoured method of trial and error. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why has Australia departed from the course of action which France, Britain, Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have followed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would happen in the case of an Australian in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Great Britain, Canada or New Zealand- in any of those countries- who kept repeating, even telling the whole world on television, that he wanted to go back to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policies of the former government were geared to a colonial era in which Australia dared take no action unless either Britain or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> moved first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to accuse the Minister of untruths but at one stage he did say that in the past Australia took no action unless the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or the United Kingdom moved first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, long before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom, was one of the first countries to recognise the independence of Bangladesh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and all European countries with the exception of Sweden, Finland and Switzerland have also refused to recognise the incorporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may well explain many of the recent rather odd policy decisions of the Government, such as the recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic states, the recognition of North Vietnam and the assumption of diplomatic relations with that country as well as with Algeria which is the headquarters of the Third World, the attacks on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in relation to Diego Garcia which were made with complete disregard of the fact that the actions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are in response to increased Russian naval presence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer also to the Prime Minister’s speech earlier when he made representations to both the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and said that the situation is hopeful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does anyone suggest that if there were an Australian in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America who was in a similar position that the officials of the Australian Embassy would take that Australian, hold him and not allow him freedom of movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amounts are to be paid in the national currency of each member country up to the equivalent of the amounts in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars specified in the attached table, which I ask leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The documents which I have, and which no doubt are available in the Parliamentary Library, indicate that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada have very strict controls residing in their national governments for the sort of management of uranium resources that the Australian Minister is seeking here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is limited by the reference to defence as is this provision outside territories under Commonwealth control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The results led to the establishment of the Radium Hill mining project in 1954, producing uranium oxide yellow cake from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-United Kingdom combined development agency over a period of 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project was financed by the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rum Jungle operation in the Northern Territory about the same time as Radium Hill, and later the mines of Mary Kathleen in Queensland and on the South Alligator River in the Northern Territory, all of which had contracts to supply the United Kingdom or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> government agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these early uranium contracts terminated about 1964 as a result of stockpile sufficiency and lower cost supplies being available chiefly from Canada in respect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and United Kingdom markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that in Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the chief markets for the uranium of which we have such great supplies, there is an extremely cool attitude towards Australia exporting the enriched product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that whatever mistakes we have made in Australia, they were more than compounded in the nineteenth century in Kentucky and in other States in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by what they call strip mining; we call it open cut mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1950s and the 1960s, basically the <span class="highlight">United States</span> economy was characterised by approximate stability of prices; and this exercised a stabilising influence on world prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December 1971 the McMahon Government caved in to political blackmail from an unrepresentative minority party which was concerned with the protection of its eroding electoral base and the interests of its financial backers, who had been foolish enough to write long term contracts in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars in the late 1 960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it appropriate under these circumstances for the company to apply to Australia the same kind of standards that it has applied in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that is to withdraw the substance, to clarify the situation, to find whether this is a true complication of the apparatus and, if it is a complication, to withdraw it completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:  (1), (2), (3) and (4) The Government’s decision to purchase two patrol frigates from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was taken only after a thorough examination of all the factors involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Is it not a fact that Australian-American relations were always excellent until last year when  Dr Cairns  and other senior Ministers severely criticised the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this indicate a change of view on the part of  Dr Cairns  and other senior Ministers towards the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The implication of the question is, of course, that there has been some deterioration in the relationship between this country and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> over the past 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> 3 times in that period and the last impression I would get would be any sense of antagonism or frustration in relationships between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One might imagine that one of the reasons for the hurried visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to New York, by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F.

    <p>On February 14 1973 we did not depreciate with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, so in effect we appreciated by 1 1 per cent against the U.S. dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that according to the ‘Age’ of 16th of this month  Mr Garlick,  the industrial officer of the Civil Air Operations Officers’ Association, when advocating a civil aviation agency similar to the Federal Aviation Agency in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, said that aviation safety standards in Australia were going down hill and the best way to stop this was to establish a new civil aviation body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the concept of a family court is derived from American experience we ought to look at what America has done and in particular, because I see him as an adviser in this chamber at the moment, at that admirable report made some years ago by an officer of the Attorney-General’s Department,  Mr Yuill,  in which the various family courts and the differences in concept from State to State in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were elaborated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concept of a ‘family court’ is well established in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and Japan though there are variations in the proceedings and powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he the same  Sir Reginald  Sholl who, in the infamous  Sir Richard  Stawell Oration in 1970, expressed the view that the anti- Vietnam war movement in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was a plot by the Jewish supporters of Israel and who, in that oration and at meetings sponsored by the League of Rights, consistently expresses opposition to liberal attitudes generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that  Mr Nicholas  Johnson, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, now  chairman  of that country’s National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, is in Australia at the invitation of the Australian Government and, in particular, at my invitation as Minister for the Media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present an exchange of notes between the Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> governments providing for amendments to the agreement of 9 May 1963 relating to the establishment of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval communication station in Australia, together with a statement by the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  on those amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we read the world news we see what is happening in Japan, with its enormous rate of inflation, and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but we have to come into the Senate to hear a senator actually say that it is all propaganda to claim that inflation is world wide and that inflation is being imported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> these compulsory powers in regard to counselling have been done away with because experience has proved that it is not the way to go about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, experience in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> indicates that these are rarely used, if at all.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, a number of contracts have been won by Australians for recording performances in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that arrangements are being made for a number of Australian performers to take entertainment contracts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator knows anything about the entertainment industry within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> he will know that that is an extremely difficult area for a foreigner to break into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is clear evidence that significant export opportunities are being lost in this field because of the absence in Australia of export financing facilities similar to those provided in such countries as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada, Japan and Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the contribution authorised for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is US$1,500m or one-third of the total sought, this means, in effect, that the fourth replenishment will only become effective, and other countries will only be required to contribute to IDA, as and when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> formally notifies IDA that it has taken all the necessary legislative steps to enable it to participate on the basis of the agreement reached at Nairobi last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite an early set-back, legislation authorising the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to contribute a further US$ 1,500m to IDA under the fourth replenishment was eventually passed by Congress on 3 1 July 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not been able to give the formal notification required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, on top of the landing charge for a Boeing 747 of $A449 at Honolulu there is a communications charge of $53 Australian, a passenger holding area charge of $25, a baggage claim area charge of $13, a Customs overtime charge of $48, plus a <span class="highlight">United States</span> transportation charge (paid by passenger) of $3 per head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At San Francisco where the landing fee for a Boeing 747 is $216, the communications charge is $3 1, passenger holding area charge is $109 plus amortisation and interest on capital expenditure made there by Qantas of $193, a baggage claim area charge of $41, Customs overtime $137, <span class="highlight">United States</span> transportation tax of $3 per head plus a San Mateo County Property tax of $ 1 34. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And this is an indication of where the <span class="highlight">United States</span> position is quite contrary to what the Attorney-General is urging on Australia, and he is urging a vastly more liberal position in Australia- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision is greatly welcomed by manufacturing industry because a number of Australia’s major competitors, particularly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada, Japan and Britain are already providing similar types of financial arrangements at concessional rates of interest and on concessional conditions to assist their own exporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 25 arises from the need to overcome a problem which virtually prevents the employment of <span class="highlight">United States</span> nationals in Commonwealth departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the professional and technical skills required on certain Commonwealth projects of national importance are sometimes most readily available by the use of limited numbers of <span class="highlight">United States</span> personnel, it is desirable to permit temporary employment, without requiring the taking of the oath or affirmation, in appropriate cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I wish to put to the Attorney-General in point blank terms is: Let us take the case of Ehrlichman in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, who was an officer of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ought to mention that according to a note which the Parliamentary Library supplied to me British civil servants, whilst they are not required to take an oath of allegiance, are nevertheless required to sign a document incorporating an oath of allegiance with certain statutory requirements of the Official Secrets Act and that a form of oath or allegience is demanded of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> civil servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A guarantor, an insurance company, in those circumstances may well feel that it has adequate redress in the case of a foreign resident or a foreign company by a right of action in the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, or some European or Asian country; but if as a result of the Bretton/Woods agreement- the International Monetary Agreements Act- that person cannot enforce his rights in those countries, what we are doing by way of legislation here will prejudice a guarantor, an insurance company, in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need, which was recognised long ago in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in the First Interim Report of the Eggleston Committee, for an expert body with continuity of existence to be charged with a responsibility for seeing that the laws are kept up to date at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we go beyond the Australian and New Zealand situations we find that enormous subsidies are provided to the dairying industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in Canada and that in the European Economic Community approximately $ 1,000m to $2,000m is expended on dairying subsidies- a situation which, on occasions in the past, has enabled the dairying industry from the Community countries to compete by virtually dumping in some of the traditional markets of the Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody mentions the economic position in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> today, the great image of the free traders and the people who talk about free enterprise, because unemployment there is somewhere between 7 per cent and 10 per cent, even on all sorts of variable bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a subject to which I wish to direct my attention, and during my remarks I will quote extensively from a book recently published entitled ‘No Final Victories’ by Lawrence O’Brien who is identified as a campaign director for former <span class="highlight">United States</span> Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not mind how hard people play politics but I resent people like Randolph Hearst, a few years ago in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and Hancock in Western Australia feeling that they have the answer to our political ills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>O’Brien found that when the Nixon machine was working in top gear the Democrats were virtually blackmailed off the <span class="highlight">United States</span> television channels because Spiro Agnew and the big business people threatened to apply sanctions on the big television networks if they gave the Democrats a semblance of fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in Australia simply fill in a card and send it to the Chief Electoral Officer to get their names on the electoral roll, whereas I understand that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> one must go to a registry, which is tedious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because it is expressed well, I should like to refer to a speech which was made by a senior Republican senator from Utah in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Honourable Wallace F.

    <p>I wonder whether  Mr Whitlam  in his travels overseas, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada and Germany, when he had the opportunity to talk to politicians and civil servants of other federations, put to them the view that they are being governed under some transitional form of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has often been said in debate on electoral legislation that the laws of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have some relevance, but instead one should observe that there are great differences between the position in this country and that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition it is significant that in 1972 the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal Election Campaign Act became law and it provided, among other things, for disclosure of all contributions in excess of $100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The court system of the central Government in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> stands side by side with the court system of the States, ‘ he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The judicial mechanisms of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the area of crime are hampered and hindered in their function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went through a series of 3 State courts and finally went to the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the new court is created there will be registrars and registries and marshals to enforce the law similar to the system which exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, with all its inadequacies and dissatisfactions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asked now to produce at this stage a new series of courts ignoring the experience of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the writings of our legal authorities over the years and to proceed in an era when this country is caught up with inflation and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been stated- I reiterate- that the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ experience of a dual court system ought not to be emulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the explanation of the long drawn out litigation which we all know characterises the <span class="highlight">United States</span> lies in the existence of State supreme courts and a federal court system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should endeavour to avoid the <span class="highlight">United States</span> system where, for example, after a State supreme court has decided against a litigant he may go to a federal court and attempt to have the judgment set aside, and often succeed in doing so on a ground which was not taken in the supreme court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember so vividly discussing this matter with judges of one of the State supreme courts when I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read it closely and I cannot find a word which suggests that one of his reasons was the alleged reason that has been kicked around this chamber- the possibility of the confusion and abuse of legal process which we know occurs in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a very good reason why we do not find that argument advanced in any of their pronouncements and that is that the problem that exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> does not exist here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we get a Superior Court exercising Federal jurisdiction concurrently with the State courts we have a quite different situation from that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was touched on, although he did not draw all the inferences from it, by  Senator Missen  when he admitted that the State courts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are not invested with federal jurisdiction; so each branch of the law in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is administering a different corpus of law and often there is conflict between those laws and there is a possibility for litigants to jump from one system of law to the other and make ducks and drakes of the legal system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of thing that happens in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> all the time because there are competing Federal and State jurisdictions in the same fields of human activity, especially in the criminal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should we perpetuate the problems associated with off-shore rights as between States and Federal institutions, problems that still exist today in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It was acknowledged even by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America that Australia ‘s contribution to the war effort was not a 25 per cent contribution but a 100 per cent contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will recall the crude public attacks made by 3 Ministers,  Dr Cairns  and Messrs Cameron and Uren, on the  President  and Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America over the bombing of North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia was involved in a lot of pioneering and innovative work but, as our market became saturated by films from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which were able to find ready and profitable outlets in Australia, at cheap rates, the local industry was not able to flourish and declined and passed from the scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the method which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities are now using against Australia in refusing to allow kangaroo products into that country- the matter of trading in products from endangered or other species- is about the only means of enforcement, apart from political or general trading sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this sort of situation the most likely recipient of an export subsidy- an across the board export subsidywould be the foreign buyer, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shows that the price for meat per cents per kilogram for boneless manufacturing cow beef in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market at September 1 974 was 123.2c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Wechsler  said that it was a very strong organisation financially, deriving its funds from members in sums of $20 and $40 a week each, from rich donors in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in the Socialist Workers Party of that country, from functions and from the Australian Union of Students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the classic example of a Securities and Exchange Commission is to be found in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, due regard has been paid to the laws and practices in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its consideration of those matters my Department was fortunate in having assistance from eminent persons from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later on the Attorney General’s Department was fortunate to obtain the assistance of Professor Louis Loss, Cromwell Professor of Law at Harvard University and the author of an authoritative work on the securities industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a need, which was recognised long ago in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in the First Interim Report of the Eggleston Committee, for an expert body with continuity of existence to be charged with a responsibility for seeing that the laws are kept up to date at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America this has been recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America have long ago prohibited insider trading and this Bill now adopts a similar approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has shown that this is an important area of securities legislation and I envisage that the Commission will give consideration to improved legislation at an early date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The latter provision is in line with the law in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we compare our position with that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, on a population basis, we can see that that country is running a deficit that is double the deficit in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than face this prospect the regime in Saigon, urged on by the then <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration, refused to hold elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real result of foreign intervention, principally the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the side of Saigon and Russia on the side of Hanoi, has been to raise the level of violence, to raise the capacity for mutual destruction on both sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Secretary,  Mr Schlesinger,  said on 31 March that it was Saigon’s withdrawal rather than a communist general offensive which was the primary cause of the Government of Vietnam ‘s present difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the orchestrated outpourings of the past week there has been just one new note- muted as yet, but clearly designed to become a grand new theme- and that .is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is an untrustworthy ally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What else is the purpose of this attempt to blame the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress and the American people for the debacle in which the Government of South Vietnam now finds itself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could be only one other motive -to shame the <span class="highlight">United States</span> back into Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this its proposal for either the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or Australia to get back into the war, to prolong it for yet another decade? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for Australia and for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the constant challenge made in this House, not least from the present Leader of the Opposition, was ‘stand up and be counted’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the members of the Opposition now stand up and be counted and say that they believe it was wrong that we should have got completely out of the war or believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or Australia should go back into the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, she has fulfilled any obligations she assumed to the Government of Saigon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ honour and interests do lie in helping rebuild a unified Vietnam, the unification of which misguided policies, mistaken policies of the past so long delayed; the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ honour and interest lie in helping to rebuild an Indo-China to the devastation of which those policies so greatly contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to regain her real place of leadership in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And in that task Australia, as far as this Government is concerned, will be a good partner with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have no truck with those who put out the line that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should resume her intervention in the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, Australia’s security, as with the peace of the world, rests ultimately upon making the detente between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union a success and with associating China in a wider detente. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The requests were made by Italy, Greece, France, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-60-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canada has established a Metric Conversion Commission and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has recently provided US$30m for training in the metric system which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Act says ‘will become the predominant system of measurement in America. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additionally it is expected that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in October or November another exposition or exhibition is to be held which I think is commonly referred to as Musexpo 75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department is now negotiating with the Department of Overseas Trade with a view to seeing whether it is possible for us to engage a stand at Musexpo so that we hopefully can obtain sales of Australian records in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has always been more critical of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and South Vietnam than it has been of Soviet Russia, China or North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government believes in the Accords it should make public appeals for the governments of those nations to desist in their destruction of South Vietnam in the same way as it publicly called on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to halt its intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It condemned the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for supplying troops and other aid to South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in the past the Government has never been remiss in revealing its protests to non-communist countries and some of its members, notably  Dr Cairns  and  Mr Uren,  equally have never been silent in their public condemnation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are not calling upon the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to enter the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America wanted to take this dispute to the United Nations it was the previous Liberal-Country Party Government which discouraged it from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a great pity that the previous Government opposed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> trying to bring the United Nations into the dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that happened was that even more arms came in to the other side, and eventually the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America withdrew its enormous forces from the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Heavens above, did not the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  or the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)  tell this Parliament how the Australian Government in 1964 and in 1968 in a memorandum requested the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government not to take the matter of Vietnam to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Opposition which when it was in Government in the early 1 960s involved us in war in Vietnam ostensibly and only for the reason that it was a <span class="highlight">United States</span> sanctioned war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because time is catching up, I turn very briefly to allegations that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and South Vietnam violated the Geneva Accords by rejecting free elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister cynically and falsely blames the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and South Vietnam for not agreeing to free elections during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister dealt with the matter of a political settlement and criticised the South Vietnamese and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for not agreeing to a political settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in 1965, as part of a deal with other countries, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Australian troops were on their way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the country on which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America dropped twice the tonnage of bombs that it used in the entire Second World War; the country on which was dropped, until the cease fire in 1 973, more than 3 times the tonnage of bombs that was dropped in the Second World War by everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> State Department figures, casualties in South Vietnam from 1960 to 1972 were 476 837 wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The so-called republic of Vietnam was established and the Geneva Accords were completely defied by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and by its puppet regime in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fighting continued, as it was bound to continue, in the one country of Vietnam, falsely and unlawfully divided by the actions of the Eisenhower Administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately it became apparent that the forces of the Vietnamese people were stronger than the combined forces of the puny puppet regime in Saigon and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the most powerful country in the world, and its satraps who took part in the struggle along with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, were driven from that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, at the time the Americans were justifying their original intervention in Vietnam- and in one of the White Papers produced before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate- it was found that only 5 per cent of the arms in the Vietcong ‘s possession came from communist sources, that the other 95 per cent were either arms captured from the southern forces, and the Americans, or primitive arms they had manufactured for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things which distresses me very greatly and which comes from this arbitrary division of the world into the communists- as if Mao Tse-tung and Brezhnev and Phan Van Quang and Kim il Sung were all going along the same path together- one of the consequences of this untutored and unsophisticated view of world politics is that we may well drive people into identifying the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America with all that is evil in the world, because if one were to identify the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with the point of view we get from the Australian Opposition, that is what would happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest it is a travesty of the American position, because certainly the leaders of the majority party both in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate and in the House of Representatives are and always have been opponents of the American intervention in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the hazard is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could well abandon what are real and constructive responsibilities that it does have for the preservation of peace in other parts of the world- for example, in the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact since the Paris Peace Accords were signed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has disengaged from South Vietnam and the size of the South Vietnamese army and its forces has decreased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware that a securities and exchange commission has been in existence in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for 40 or more years; but how is it operated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An eminent member of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities Commission was employed to advise the Government on the drafting of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was found to be so most glaringly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at the height of the Great Depression when  President  Roosevelt’s Administration, after its election in 1932, determined that at least part- certainly not all but at least part and a significant part- of the great distress which had afflicted the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the Great Depression had been caused not by problems in the economy, in the narrow sense of the economy, but by malpractices, defects in the stock exchanges of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be remembered that the first  Chairman  of the American Securities and Exchange Commission was  Mr Joseph  Kennedy, the father of the late  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, indeed, none of the things which happened between 1900 and 1910, and indeed none of the things subsequently dealt with by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, could have been any worse than some of the matters which were revealed by the inquiries of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember shortly after the Committee had been constituted I was travelling in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and happened to be invited to attend a meeting of one of the smaller American stock exchanges, the Honolulu Stock Exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it a fact, as reported in a section of today’s Press, that the Australian Government did not send aircraft to Vietnam for humanitarian relief purposes recently until after a request was made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of State,  Dr Kissinger? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have expected some countries, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, to be upset about the bauxite agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He goes on to refer to the attention that the United Kingdom, Canada and even the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had given in that field following the lead of the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote  Mr Casey,  who was speaking as  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission to the first World Congress of Stock Exchanges which was held in Milan in March 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives little indication that some of the major lessons which can be learned from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission and from the approaches in Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom and other countries, have been learned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has failed, I think most would agree that its failure has been basically the development of a bureaucratic aspect related to the registration statements procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The registration statement in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has become a monster which serves little purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone starting to study the registration statements in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be inclined to the view that under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone invest in that company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every other way I believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has served an extremely useful function and again we come to one of the lessons that apparently have not been learned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no companies registry role for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have people who are to act as the statutory regulators, the statutory surveillance body, the watchdog or whatever one wishes to call it, I believe they must be people who have had experience in the securities industry and who perhaps, as they do in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, come into that body for a period of time and then go back to the securities industry so that there is a constant interchange between the regulatory body and the industry which it is regulating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it may be of some interest to refer to the evidence given to a Congressional sub-committee in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on 5 October 1972 by  Mr Philip  Loomis, one of the commissioners with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S.A. which had been involved in a very heavy consideration of the role of self regulation as applied in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The experts involved in preparing the Bill included Professor Louis Loss of Harvard, Solomon Freedman, a former high official of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission and  Dr John  Rose, to whom  Senator Rae  has paid a fitting tribute today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is highly regarded in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as my colleague  Senator Wheeldon  will be able to confirm, and he has been prominent in public life in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America several large projects have been mounted in recent years- in science, social science and the humanities- generally with Federally provided budgets of several million dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister received a copy of a statement by  President  Marcos of the Philippines, which received some radio coverage this morning, and which in part conveys a change of attitude towards the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and a possible vacation by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of bases and interests in the Philippines, and further makes reference to possible Japanese involvement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who know about the development of FM licenses in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and elsewhere will realise that the younger generation in particular will be attracted to FM broadcasts and that in terms of commercial stations the younger generation constitutes the big advertising audience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other countries, notably the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom, have taken a similar approach to the matter and have banned unsolicited cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Science aware that some new 6-cylinder cars in Australia are being sold fitted with cheap 2-ply tyres imported from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that these tyres, although complying with Australian standards, do not comply with <span class="highlight">United States</span> standards for tyres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has led me to change my mind on this matter simply is the experience of the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ‘ have spent the last week sorting through the experiences which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate has had in dealing with the several occasions when accusations or allegations have been made against honourable senators in the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate were being forced into positions in which they were taking political attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, a citadel of what is rather euphemistically described as free enterprise, Canada, Sweden and France, the crop insurance cover available to farmers is considerably better than that which is available to farmers in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming back to the question of crop insurance, I repeat that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada, France and Sweden there is already a much better situation for farmers than there is in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen the publication ‘Chile Today’, an official publication of the Government of Chile, which carries a report that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> recently has sold a substantial amount of wheat to Chile on very favourable terms? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that this year Chile will import considerable quantities of wheat from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and also from Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the conditions under which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ships wheat to Chile are extremely generous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that when the trade union problem is resolved the 300 000 tonnes to which I referred earlier will still be sought by Chile, but it is very unlikely that we would supply the wheat on the same terms and conditions as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is supplying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it suggested by honourable senators that the economic problems that face this country are different from the economic problems that face countries that have conservative governmentsfor example, France or the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Government was prepared to condemn the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but was not prepared to engage in any similar condemnation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not in the same terms because while it is true that there have been gross breaches of the Paris Accords by both North and South Vietnam and by the Provisional Revolutionary Government and perhaps by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, nevertheless the breaches have not been all of the same kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration there was a large number of people who were described as hawks who supported the war in the very early days and in the middle stages of the American involvement in Vietnam and who subsequently publicly condemned not only their own attitude to the war but also America’s involvement in the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of men and equipment in South Vietnam at the end of the period which culminated in the Paris Agreements, I quote from one of the most authorative journals in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> known as ‘Foreign Affairs’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Geneva Agreement to which all of the nations involved put their signature, with the exception of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, although it did give an undertaking at the time that it would honour a particular agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Quorum formed) In view of the remark that was passed by  Senator Wright,  although I did not intend to dwell upon the infamy of the involvement of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia through political pressure, I propose to read from ‘The Pentagon Papers’ a document dated 7 February 1965 which indicates the attitude in the Pentagon at that stage to what it was going to do to Vietnam and in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communications - have been to both sides though not in the same terms because while it is true that there have been gross breaches of the Paris Agreements by both North and South Vietnam and by the Provisional Revolutionary Government and perhaps by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, nevertheless the breaches have not been all of the same kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was in Hanoi in 1973 just after the genocidal bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by the B52s of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force, and I do know that one could walk around anywhere through the streets of Hanoi and Haiphong at any time of the day or night in complete safety, that one did not need to have armed police on every corner, that one would not have known there was a war on, apart from the fact that there were air raid shelters and that every now and then a convoy of troops would move through that beleaguered and smashed city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those leaders are the people who defeated the corrupt clique in Saigon- the Thieus and the Kys- and not the Russian arms or the Chinese arms of which the amount, compared with what was provided by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, was microscopic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first papers that was issued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration concerning its intervention in Vietnam referred to the weapons that had been captured from the forces fighting for the so-called Vietcong, the National Liberation Front, and only 2V4 per cent of those weapons were manufactured in a country with a communist government, such as the Soviet Union, China or Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can say to  Senator Greenwood  that the number of his supporters on the issue of Vietnam has diminished from the number that it was a few weeks ago because many Liberals now agree with the statements which have been made in recent weeks by <span class="highlight">United States</span> leaders in their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Commonwealth’ confuses English-speaking people connected with Britain or the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, since the former now relate the word to the Commonwealth of Nations and the latter to the Commonwealth status formerly enjoyed by the Philippines, at present by Puerto Rico and prospectively by the Marianas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other recent statements, however, President Marcos has referred to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as the Philippines most valuable ally, although he has also indicated that the Philippines will be seeking new security arrangements which should encompass a firm and clear commitment by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to assist the Philippines in case of external aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the substance of the letter as given to the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition was correct and in particular, whether the 2 points of the Provisional Revolutionary Government program required the resignation of  President  Thieu and the end of all <span class="highlight">United States</span> support for the Government of South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You will remember,  Mr President,  and honourable senators will remember, that last year the Minister for Defence,  Mr Barnard,  contracted to buy 2 patrol frigates from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America at a price of about $ 1 87m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators opposite say that they believe therefore that racism did not have its origins in the superior race theories of Adolf Hitler and in some of those racist groups that operate within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which clearly are gaining in influence within our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1968 the President’s Commission on Postal Organisations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America expressed this opinion: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recommend that a Postal Corporation owned entirely by the Federal Government be chartered by Congress to operate the postal service of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on a selfsupporting basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the position in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the benefit of the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience and I believe that if we are allowed to enter into the spirit of what is spelt out in the Vernon Commission’s report, hundreds of millions of dollars will accrue to the postal services and will transform it into a viable commercial proposition of which we in Australia will be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we could gain from the knowledge of people not only in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but also in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is very hard to make a comparison with comparable countries which do not have a situation exactly the same as there is in Australia, but in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> telecommunications services are run by private enterprise while postal services as from 12 August 1970 have been run by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Postal Service which is a corporation-style federal agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he has examined the method of financing postal and telecommunications services in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will undoubtedly know that financing of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Postal Service is by bond issue up to a limit of $ 10,000m with an annual ceiling of $2,000m of which $ 1,500m is for capital investment and $500m is to cover operating deficits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that that is a world wide position even though the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, for example, opted for a total moratorium and we did also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general position, as I understand it, is that inquiries were made through <span class="highlight">United States</span> sources, Pentagon records and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time there was no confirmation of intervention by <span class="highlight">United States</span> forces in the experiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it was necessary to clothe the Commission with sufficient power to deal with railway rates, discrimination, rebates and all other forms of unfair treatment, as has been done in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where they have established a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Commerce Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, perhaps, did the founding fathers look to the American institution, the Federal Inter-State Commission, which has operated with expanding authority in the Federation which was our parent so far as constitutional structure is concerned, namely, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America from then to now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that in copying the old 1892 <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation this Government will live to regret the antediluvian mistake it has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately his Party in Tasmania does not hold this view because the man about whom he said some very harsh things,  Mr Sherry,  2 elections ago was opposed by a rather right wing gentleman from the southern states of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware that the left wing of that party wishes that all <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases in Australia be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are pleased that the more responsible elements in that Party imposed their will and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An amendment to article 2 limits <span class="highlight">United States</span> control to the exclusive occupation of a national room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has visited the North West Cape base on many occasions, I know that the reality of the situation is that the base always has been open to the general public except for the national room, which always has been exclusively for only <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval personnel, and that arrangement operates for very good reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not quite clear about what that means, but if it satisfies the Government and it placates the opponents of <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases, we have no quarrel with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our only concern is that the base should retain its operational functions as an important link in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval communications network. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation does not in any way alter that arrangement or weaken the importance of the base as part of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval radio network. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as  Senator Wright  has reminded me, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> still has exclusive use and occupancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, during the Second World War relations between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia doubtless were of a very high standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  President  Kennedy, a  President  of stature, indicated in his revelations that Presidents of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America have had occasion to keep their defence chiefs on a tight leash, in the same way as Prime Ministers of Australia have had to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It dealt with a possible nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and a stage was reached where only about 5 people were left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think even a former Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  had to exercise his sovereign powers about <span class="highlight">United States</span> nuclear naval craft coming here if there was an element of danger that there could be some serious catastrophe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only difference is that people would applaud that decision, even if it was contrary to <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy, whereas if a Labor Prime Minister did it, certain people would question his loyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We talk about a family of nations, and I think the present Prime Minister has referred to special relations between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agreement did respect the sovereignty of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and of Australia and nothing which has happened since has altered that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was said by  Mr Whitlam  that the agreement in 1963 was a derogation of Australia’s sovereignty, as he has said, then not one whit of the agreement has been altered in that respect as a result of what  Mr Barnard  supposedly achieved in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, that the control of the station should rest with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control of the station has always been with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and good reasons were advanced in 1963 that it should remain with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control of the station remains with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> today as it should, and no amount of words or double talk or deception will alter that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be of great value to Australia that the control of the base does rest with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventhly, that, without submitting to the jurisdiction of Australian courts, or compromising its sovereignty, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would conform to Australian law and its personnel would observe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the only words added to a provision which gives the <span class="highlight">United States</span> exclusive occupancy of the land and which continues the exclusive occupancy subject to those provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that there should always be a willingness to join with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the provision of bases such as this one, provided that there is reasonable access and that Australia’s sovereignty is protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the consequences of what  Mr Whitlam  said and what  Mr Barnard  supposedly negotiated in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> reveal it to be nothing more than political claptrap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has told this Government that it is willing to enter into consultations and has said that it is prepared to make North-West Cape a joint installation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a power to veto- a power to say ‘No’ and that is what the Opposition wants to be said to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the agreement reveals is how little was obtained in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment to Article 1 of the agreement provides that the station at North West Cape shall be operated jointly, while an amendment to Article 2 limits <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy exclusive occupation to a national room and provides for a similar Australian national room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  is somewhat uncritical in regard to large scale curriculum projects in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Valuable assistance has been given in other countries by such groups as the National Schools Council in the United Kingdom, the Nuffield Science Project and various projects in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which are federally funded and which have aided teachers and pupils in many fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> throws the whole Convention out of the window and says: ‘We will make our own arrangements in relation to racial discrimination on the grounds of religion, cast and colour’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government, for example, does make quite a major financial contribution towards the maintenance of crop and livestock insurance in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that would be an additional reason for  Senator Chaney  to wish to emulate what is done in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as he would like to emulate most things American, particularly in regard to foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have since had my Department check the position and, for the honourable senator’s information, I am advised that it does not cost the <span class="highlight">United States</span> domestic telephone subscriber $43 rental a year with unlimited free local calls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not cost the <span class="highlight">United States</span> business subscriber $54 a year with 960 free local calls a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are aware, that citizen of that state of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was Govenor Gerry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have the latest figures for Australia but the figures relating to congressional districts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> lead me to the conclusion that on the current trend of population more than one million people will change their address in a 3-year span. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting, particularly in the light of the Bill introduced by the Government and which is before the Senate now, that in a similar measure the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America reserved the right not to implement sections of the Convention which, as the Americans put it, contradicted America’s own constitutional provision for the freedom of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">United States</span> study recently showed that learning a foreign language was a significant attitude towards people, and in particular that language learning beginning at primary level helped with the removal of prejudices and helped to develop appropriate social attitudes and social interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister representing the Attorney-General to the Government’s proposal to introduce a Freedom of Information Bill along the lines of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Freedom of Information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United Kingdom, Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> trade union training has been proceeding in a much bigger way for a very long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having referred to England may I make a brief reference to an authority from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America,  Dr Schmidt,  who in his recent book entitled ‘Union Power’ referred to the enormous power of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him: How long will the Minister tolerate the agent provocateur role being pursued by the New South Wales Minister for Education,  Mr Willis,  in creating a surplus of school teachers in New South Wales and thereby placing <span class="highlight">United States</span> nationals in the role of professional cannon fodder? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government does agree with the statement of  Dr Cairns,  how does the Government reconcile that statement with the statement made by the Prime Minister in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Labor Government has secured agreement from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government that if industry were unable to provide up to 25 per cent of the value of contract of work to Australian industry, the Department of Defence would use its offices to raise Australian industry participation to this level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of the loan is expressed in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one reads the Bill one gets the clear view that we will be taking an exchange risk if there is any movement in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that a proportion of the total amount to be raised may well be borrowed in currencies other than <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5, which relates to this matter, defines the means by which any amounts borrowed in such currencies can be converted into <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar equivalent of these currencies needs to be expressed for practical reasons in terms of the prevailing market rates of exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the rate is expected to be about 9 per cent and some of the funds will be provided from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> loan now being negotiated in New York. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, signed at Washington on 14 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governments of New Zealand, India, Israel and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, to name but a few, are already involved to varying degrees in providing insurance to their citizens, and some, but not all, include natural disaster insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the suspension on 22 March of efforts by  Dr Kissinger,  the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of State, to bring about a second-stage agreement between Egypt and Israel, the Egyptian Government has formally requested the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on the Middle East, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union, to re-convene the Conference as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-66-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, it is understood, nas not excluded the possibility of further steps towards a Middle East settlement in advance of or separate from any such Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-66-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Australian Government recently negotiated a loan from sources in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it says something for the limitations which our society places on the activities of some of its leading citizens that this would be almost taken for granted in a society such as in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where a man who chooses one occupation is not considered to be limited for his entire life to that occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> it is quite commonplace for professors of law to act as arbitrators in disputes between companies or between trade unions and companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of Australia’s good relations with both Thailand and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, will the Minister indicate whether any official statement has been made commenting on the recent use of <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases in Thailand over the ‘Mayaguez’ incident against the expressed wish of the Thai Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government supports the territorial sovereignty of both Cambodia and Thailand and will use all diplomatic means to express the attitude of the Australian Government to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> against the use of force between friendly nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the last occasion this Bill was before the Senate, much was made by the Opposition of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience as a reason why the Bill should not be proceeded with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made that, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, a person losing a case in State jurisdiction could then go to the Federal jurisdiction and have the result reversed on a point of federal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could arise in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, because there the State courts do not have, and cannot be invested with, any federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that, away from this field,  Senator Greenwood  is a keen student of foreign affairs and he would know that there are many maritime disputes in all sorts of countries, even on the east and west coasts of our powerful neighbour, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that the loan was first sought in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by people who had authority from the Minister at the time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that when the loan was agreed upon, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Treasury agreed to the loan being made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is going to seek support by referring to the countries I have already mentioned, it is just as valid for the Opposition to refer to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan and Canada, and of course hitherto Australia, where these internal-external telecommunications services have been conducted under separate authorities, and have been conducted successfully under separate authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we have clear evidence of the experience in other countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan and Canada, each of which has a separate organisation to run the overseas telecommunications service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 provisions that we have had incorporated in our Constitution in contradistinction from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are that the High Court has been made a court of general appeal not merely from Federal courts, as is the case in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but from both Federal and State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the New York loan announcement is made it will establish beyond any doubt that the loan being raised in accordance with the requirements of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission, which seeks the most stringent conditions from any borrower, indicates that the credibility of this country has in no way been damaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what the Opposition has said, on the record of evidence available to the whole world, Australia’s credit rating in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is at an all time high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The notice of motion continues:  to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorised the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding $4,000m in the currency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for temporary purposes, and because the Government refuses to appoint a royal commission with proper and adequate terms of reference to investigate and report upon all aspects of the Government’s overseas loan activities, the Senate resolves- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the war we began to look much more to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Swiss markets, and even to Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, with the effective closure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> capital market as a result of the introduction of the interest equalisation tax in 1963, the Australian Government turned to Euro-currency raisings in the German, Dutch and Swiss markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The orthodox objections that such funds could cause distortion, if admitted into the Australian economy, were answered by my proposal to domicile such funds in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, invested in approved securities in the name of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and with the approval of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal Reserve Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> interest rates then available were comparable with those of the proposed borrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of motion add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government has failed to give to the Parliament and the Australian people a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council Meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorized the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for temporary purposes, and because the Government refuses to appoint a Royal Commission with proper and adequate terms of reference to investigate and report upon all aspects of the Government’s overseas loan activities, the Senate resolves- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of Australia’s good relations with both Thailand and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, will the Minister indicate whether any official statement has been made commenting on the recent use of <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases in Thailand over the Mayaguez’ incident against the expressed wish of the Thai Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>WHEREAS the Commonwealth of Australia (hereinafter called ‘Australia’) proposes to borrow a sum not exceeding Four thousand million dollars in the currency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America (U.S.$4,000,000,000) for temporary purposes; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Resolution, a copy of which was attached to each summons, is directed to the activities of Ministers and servants and agents of the Government, relating to dealings by them prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council meeting of 13 December 1974 authorising the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for temporary purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Resolution recites the Senate’s opinion ‘that the Government has failed to give to the Parliament and the Australian people a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council Meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorized the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for temporary purposes’ and states that the Senate resolves that a number of named persons of whom I am one be called to the Bar of the Senate ‘to answer questions upon these matters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and the Government in the past used to rely greatly upon the decisions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has always been somewhat addicted to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, throughout the whole of this exercise, not once has the Prime Minister or any of his colleagues adverted to the decisions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court in connection with the Nixon tapes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a fair summary of what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court said is that if Congress wants something there is no such thing as executive privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope I am not doing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court an injustice in putting it in those terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What that document states is that there are practices in the United Kingdom, there are practices before the courts, there is a practice in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and there is a practice within Australia under which claims which are made by the Executive in the name of privilege- to refuse to answer questions or to produce documents when requested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the case of President Nixon in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who claimed confidentiality for certain tapes and records of conversations which he did not wish to reveal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The District Court in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had said that if the special prosecutor wanted those tapes he was entitled to have them; and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court unanimously decided that the District Court was right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is happening in Australia at the moment is of far greater significance than what happened to President Nixon in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> because the enormity of people in government raising billions of dollars without telling the Parliament and indeed without telling their fellow members of Cabinet, and using that as a means of subverting the Constitution and by-passing the Parliament, is criminality in the highest degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our agreement in paragraph (2) abovementioned is, of course, given on the understanding that it does not in any way whatsoever commit the Australian Government to any costs, fees or other liabilities, and it is further understood that your bank, in acting as a trustee bank, will obtain funds from the lenders in a sufficient amount to pay all operational charges or other expenses or commissions and be in a position to transfer to the Australian Government the total amount of four billion <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened in Australia at the moment is of far greater significance than what happened to  President  Nixon in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also proper that the Senate should examine its powers to appoint a special prosecutor, as was necessary in order to penetrate the cover-up in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those allegations were made before the Rockefeller Commission in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, investigating the Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In response to possible Australian defence purchases in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government decided to set up an arrangement whereby the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department and industry, in circumstances in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government could not meet orders for offset components, would allow Australian industry to bid for the work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Webster  looks at the statistics he will find that the Arabs are not involved in this field at all; it is partly the United Kingdom and partly the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, with a few other smaller interests being involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Crop insurance is well known in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where competition apparently produces the goods a little more satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand all-risk crop insurance is available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada, South Africa, Japan, Sweden, Israel and a number of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some countries such as Sweden and Japan crop insurance is compulsory: in others including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada it is voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it ironic, to say the least, that people who oppose the extension of public ownership with quasireligious zeal very strongly tend to be the same people who were eager to maintain the premium on what they call our insurance policy with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, when the premium in question was someone else’s life or someone else’s physical liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The arrangement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities was that the importation of Australian beef should be on a voluntary restrictive basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was not to impose compulsory quotas but rather to expect countries such as Australia exporting beef to that country to operate on a voluntary restraint basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the decline in the market the scheme has been reintroduced, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the quota which has been agreed upon in relation to those exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is kept, otherwise the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be placed in the position of having to impose quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that both Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America have introduced legislation along similar lines to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not draw to the attention of the Australian people the fact that our financial institutions make us a mere colony of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and England, that the views represented by those interests are not always in the best interests of Australia, and that in some instances they have reached the point of arrogance as they no longer strive to provide the fullest of covers demanded by this Government and demanded by an aware public with a developed social conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such insurance is available in countries which are completely committed to the capitalist system to the extent that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and France are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst I would not consider a comparable situation should exist in Australia at this stage to that which exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in that country members of the Senate have up to 40 employees on their staffs- speech writers, persons doing research work and persons in offices in every major town in the State in which a senator operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister know that there are representatives of the black population on the South African Olympic Games Council and that in golf tournaments in South Africa the number of black Africans who play is higher than the number of black people who play in golf tournaments in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he, in doing so, also indicate the Government’s intentions with regard to applications for entry permits on behalf of close relatives of such persons, including such relatives now living in South Vietnam, Thailand, Guam, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or elsewhere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the information which was given to the Royal Australian Air Force concerning the engine failure of the F1 1 1 aircraft of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force on 14 August, American authorities commenced inspections of the second and third stage rotating air seal in those aircraft engines which had accumulated, I think, 300 hours or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle reasons for the present improvement, of course, are the very strong increase in demand in the domestic market- consumption in Australia is up 40 per cent on last year- the reopening ofthe Japanese market and, of course, the allocation of a shortfall into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market which Australia was able to obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>fate in that country has been more than that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but, from memory, the inflation figures in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are still running at about 12 per cent or 13 per cent, and I think in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that a week or two ago the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart,  issued a statement on this matter in which he discussed a proposal that a Boxing Commission should be established in Australia, presumably similar to that which functions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Age,  in its assessment of whether Australia was stepping out of turn and whether Australia was making incorrect economic judgments and management decisions, was able to produce a graph showing that Australia was in the same category as Germany and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and that New Zealand and Great Britain were in a worse position than Australia in their Budget deficits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What are the facts concerning reports that the Australian Meat Board has curtailed approvals to ship meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> this year is about 290 000 tonnes, and until the first week in October the amount shipped was about 266 000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia received a shortfall from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of 10 000 tonnes, that is, meat which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was unable to get from its other sources of supply, and that has enabled us to export the additional amount of 10 000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that at the present time about 23 000 to 25 000 tonnes remain of our allocation to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market, and I understand that that will be completed by about the third or fourth week in November, which would place us approximately a fortnight ahead of the shipping program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since that action was taken, several countries have expressed interest in the service which currently provides for delivery of mail within 48 hours to many places in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and selected cities in the United Kingdom, and a reciprocal service to Australia is available in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Are reports correct that the Government is using large numbers of public servants and spending a great amount of money on operation ‘dirty tricks’, which is similar to that which was being conducted by  President  Nixon in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in an endeavour to obtain any issue the Government can use against any member of the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objectives of the Scheme are to allow an exchange of knowledge and to provide an opportunity for cultural and social interchanges between the people of Australia and the people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This highlights the importance of what was said in the GovernorGeneral’s Speech yesterday, namely that Australia wholeheartedly supports the building up by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of a naval capacity on the island of Diego Garcia, which admittedly is somewhat south of the Maldives but is certainly in the general area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difference is, of course, that a great many more people benefit from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> service because of the population density there and correspondingly more people are available to pay for the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I might add that some of the improvements have been influenced by the input of Australian professional judgment through RAN participation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the proposed budget for fiscal year 1977 presented to Congress on 21 January 1976, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Defence has sought funds for a further 8 follow-ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because it is a major <span class="highlight">United States</span> program we will reap the benefit of concurrent procurement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the economies of scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Soviet’s real objective, should the West respond, is to arouse the non-aligned nations to the dangers of a naval race and so create a hostile climate for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and European countries, and perhaps even ourselves, if they seek to counter this Russian presence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to develop Diego Garcia into a modest facility is no more than a response to the rapid build-up of Soviet facilities in the Indian Ocean region, not to forget of course the buoying facilities that the Russians have in the Seychelles and other parts of the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a consequence of the December election, I believe that the Senate now stands confirmed as probably the second most powerful upper house in the world, exceeded in its power only by the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, on which it is modelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 13 December 1974 the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam QC, then Prime Minister and Minister for Environment, the Honourable Reginald Francis Xavier Connor, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, The Honourable James Ford Cairns, the then Treasurer, and the Honourable Lionel Keith Murphy Q.C., then  Senator and  Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, purporting to act as and in a meeting of the Commonwealth Executive Council signed and/or caused to be signed a certain Minute Paper headed ‘Department of Minerals and Energy’ recommending for the approval of  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral, inter aiia, that in pursuance of Section 61 of the Constitution the Minister for Minerals and Energy be authorised to borrow for temporary purposes a sum in the currency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America not exceeding the equivalent of $4000m and to determine on behalf of Australia the terms and conditions of the borrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will he give consideration to the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and West Germany where, I understand, rural banks are run on cooperative lines and managed by the users of this facility? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As an indication of the Australian Government’s sincerity to combat white collar crime, will the Minister provide an explanation of the circumstances which enable former Sydney barrister and tenant basher Peter Clyne to continue to possess an Australian passport, mindful of his chequered career in Australia and his latest taxation evasion escapade in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> people of the Mormon persuasion who do not smoke or drink but who have several wives are less susceptible to cancer than those who indulge, more or less, in these pleasures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The biggest countries in the world, such as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, have completely different economic problems from those of the smaller countries, such as Ireland and Chile, which have less government in terms of the way in which the lives of the people are determined by government actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I move on to a question that I raised last night, not because I am in any position to affirm what I say, other than to traverse the ground of the interference in the internal affairs of other countries by the Cental Intelligence Agency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the current inquiries that are being undertaken by a Committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate, admissions have been made by high ranking officers of that organisation which indicate that the CIA has not only seriously interfered in the internal affairs of other countries but also has misled the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress and in fact withheld information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admissions have been made before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate Committee that the CIA was responsible for the murder of  President  Diem of South Vietnam, a  President  of whom all of those on the other side of the Senate in the then Government, which was of the same political complexion as the present Government, expressed their support when that Government involved Australia in the Vietnam war in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since international currencies started to fluctuate Australia has fared considerably worse than its 2 main competitors in overseas markets, South Africa and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments must realise, as I realise, having worked on and off in the area for some time over the last 10 years and particularly over the last 2 years, that, with the withdrawal of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> influence in the area and its recent failure to match its military capabilities with political commitment, the individual nations in South East Asia are becoming a prey to the protagonists of the Sino-Soviet dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the  New York Times  and the  Washington Post  had accepted the facile, never-look-backwards hypothesis now being offered by people in Australia who call themselves conservatives the villainies of Watergate never would have been exposed and Richard Nixon still would be  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my period of study overseas- following the time when  Senator Grimes  was a student of mine- I worked in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and, as I am sure  Senator Grimes  will agree, I was appalled at the complete lack of benefits for people in need in the hospital where I worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of statements in the  Sunday Independent  of 29 February relating to the use of the  Stirling  naval facility in Cockburn Sound by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy as a rest and recreation centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there would appear to have been little or no consultation with the authorities in Western Australia, will the Minister advise whether an approach has been made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to the Australian Government to ascertain whether we- that ‘we’ means we in Western Australia who may not care to become part of another Las Vegas or even another King’s Cross- would be prepared to make this facility available for that purpose? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy wishes to be invited to Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy wishes to come to Western Australia, whether for recreation leave or any other purpose, it will be welcomed by all the decent people of Western Australia, and they comprise the overwhelming majority of the people of Western Australia because at the last election the people of Western Australia returned not only six of the ten senators to this side of this House but also nine of the ten members to our side of the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an indication of how the people of Western Australia feel towards the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and our policies in respect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which has now by law decided that it will convert to the metric system, has requested that the  Chairman  of the Metric Conversion Board and others go to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and give advice as to how the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should proceed with its conversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That concern has been expressed both here and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> it led to the appointment of the Church Senate Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the thing which concerns people both in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and here is the belief that intelligence agencies have sometimes developed to a point where they have almost become the tail wagging the dog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A previous government established a body which has reached such proportions and whose ramifications and activities have been so great that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the Government has in fact found itself embarrassed by the activities of that agency, namely, the Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the awful situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in relation to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we have done so because it is most important that we avoid the mistakes which were made in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say to the Minister: I sincerely hope we will learn from what is happening in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to look at the subsequent course of events and at what happened to the principal intelligence organisation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the experiences of the American people as a result of the activities of that organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that last year it was in the mind of the then Prime Minister, when this legislation was drafted, that it should follow the direction taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been modelled upon the Central Intelligence Agency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do wish to refer to a number of articles that have been published in Australian newspapers indicating that the intelligence organisation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, upon which we based our intelligence organisation, has been the subject of a very constant and long overdue review by the American parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know of the activities of the Senate committee on the Intelligence Agency in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as well as of the Congressional committees, and it is alarming to read the reports which indicate that a variety of suggestions were made; for instance, that  President  de Gaulle ought to be removed from the political arena by a poison, that  President  Sukarno should be framed by the making of a pornographic film, that the  President  of South Vietnam,  Mr Diem,  be murdered, that  Mr Trujillo,  the  President  of the Dominican Republic, be murdered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Of course it was established by the Australian Labor Government and it was established at the request of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> State Department-  Senator Sim  may laugh- for the purpose of swapping information of an intelligence nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had the temerity to send to our departments and organisations cables which sought in some way to intimidate them into keeping information from the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition sees the appointment of a judge in this area as a step forward in the ultimate democratisation of the security organisations and, based on the experience in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as a development where the sort of excesses which have taken place in past years will be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examined the evidence presented to  Senator Church’s  inquiry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and if one examined the files of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation one would find reams and reams of paper expressing points of view about the activities of decent Australian people who wished only to express their views about a particular political situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One waits with interest the publication of further information from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude on the point made by Congressman Moss recently when he was asked whether such a right would not in some way endanger the security of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is a free country, the CIA is under investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Gietzelt  looked at what has been revealed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> about the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in due course there will be a balance displayed which will reveal that for all the things which the CIA did which cannot be sustained and justified it also did a power of good in difficult years to protect the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and, in protecting the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to protect a host of other countries which depend upon the stability and integrity of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By its hasty and ill conceived decision to support an escalation of the arms build-up in the region, by encouraging the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to increase its military presence on the island of Diego Garcia and then proceeding to offer the <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval access to Cockburn Sound for its nuclear armed and nuclear powered vessels, the Government at almost a single stroke has brought to an end the rational and productive foreign policy of the previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor initiatives between 1972 and 1975, which had resulted in a relationship of trust and confidence between Australia and other littoral states of the Indian Ocean, have been replaced by a policy which seeks to ignore, indeed more accurately to reverse, the passage of time in order to return to the futile era of confrontation between the major powers- the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this conservative scenario Australia has only one function to fulfil, that of a loyal, obedient, unthinking minor partner of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, a minor partner failing to identify and hence failing to take advantage of the many available opportunities which require independent initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The salient point of whether a time will emerge when Australia’s interests will not coincide, perhaps will even clash, with those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is not even considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In place of Labor’s reasoned approach to the question, which sought strenuously to encourage mutual restraint in military commitment to the region by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union, one now discovers that the present Government has adopted the curious position of both encouraging the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to increase its arms strength in the region while at the same time asking that the super powers display mutual restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor ended that, and the merit of Labor’s more rational foreign policy attitude was acknowledged publicly by the former <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador to this country,  Mr Marshall  Green. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is surely the case at present with regard to the issues pertaining to the Asian region where Labor’s reasoned approach is attuned to the progressive elements within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration and is not, unlike our conservative opponents’ policy, the product of an outdated irrelevant ideology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In anticipation of the decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of the Interior to lift its import ban on Australian kangaroo hides which should encourage the emergence of a rather sadistic commercial interest to dominate the market, I ask the Minister whether he contemplates an early meeting with all State Ministers responsible for wildlife protection to evolve an effective code which, if anything, would be more stringent than that established by the Minister’s predecessor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the previous Government’s representations, following satisfaction that the harvesting and management program was in existence, an approach was made to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to relax its ban on imports of kangaroo products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is generally accepted that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> used to be the main importer of kangaroo products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances I understand that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America will not permit the entry of kangaroo products into that country until there is a satisfactory position in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the percentages of taxes raised by the various governmental authorities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> compared with those in Australia, as I think they highlight the growing centralism which has occurred and which is evidenced by the figures which I have just given for the last 26 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the proportion of income tax raised by the Federal Government is of the order of 70 per cent; State taxation is about 16 per cent; and local government taxation is 13.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In broad terms the level of State government taxation in Australia is roughly equal to that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government taxation in Australia, however, is of the order of only 4 per cent of total taxation, which means that it is some 9 per cent less than that raised by local government in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast to that, of course, is the heavy involvement of the Federal Government in Australia which raises nearly 80 per cent of total taxation compared with the level of 70 per cent in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are pollution control devices planned for the two new frigates on order from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for the Australian Navy; if so, will these devices completely eliminate pollution sources from the ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it is impossible to completely eliminate all pollution sources from the ships, all reasonable steps have been taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy to minimise pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dingwall, indicating that the limits set by the Australian Meat Board for the export of quota meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are at this time too high I ask the Minister: What effects will the Board’s decision have on the operations of the Queensland and northern New South Wales meat works whose operations commence later in the year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the probability that the quota will be filled earlier than planned, is not the Board’s decision effectively excluding the Queensland and northern New South Wales meat works from the higher priced meat market of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to the detriment of the meat producers in those areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Australian Government give a directive to the Australian Meat Board to review as a matter of urgency the current <span class="highlight">United States</span> export limits set, in order to prevent the needless discrimination against sections of the meat producing industry which are likely to be confronted by a drastic slump in Australian cattle prices later this year if immediate action is not taken? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The great countries of the western world- Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, West Germany, to name just a few- are rejecting centralism as being completely wasteful, being completely oppressive to the taxpayer and they are moving towards federalism, as Australia now is, thank God, in order to bring government closer to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to a very interesting piece of writing by Daniel J. Elazar of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Elazar  points out what has happened in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> since the Second World War and how the criticisms of the States as being incapable of doing various things and of exercising various powers are shown to be faulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more than enough evidence to show that the States and localities, far from being weak sisters, have actually been carrying the brunt of domestic governmental progress in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ever since the end of World War II, and have done so at an accelerated pace since the advent of America’s direct combat involvement in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, they have been largely responsible for undertaking the truly revolutionary change in the role of government in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that has occurred over the past decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in the States and localities of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is a real development away from federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is a system from which we must move away on the basis of what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> found and has done for many years now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now moving towards a similar system- something which has been tried and has been operating successfully in Canada and, as I said, also in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Since the Government is on the verge of determining the  1976-77 migrant intake, can we have an assurance that in depth discussions will be held with the various teachers’ associations to ensure that we do not have a repetition of some States recruiting teachers from overseas such as in the case of New South Wales, which recruited teachers from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and virtually created an impasse? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is to be regarded as displaying a step forward in the evolution of relationships between the different arms of government then clearly it is remarkable that in that country about 33 per cent of the gross domestic product comes in the form of taxation, whereas in this country even under Labor, only 30 per cent of our gross domestic product comes from taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Jessop  who, no doubt, has just recently caught up with Calvin Coolidge ‘s thinking will remember that the late  President  said on that occasion in the era of the pre-depression boom of the 1920s that America’s business is business’, that the role of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government was to do nothing which interfered with business and to do everything which would benefit business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst some efforts have been made by the previous Government and the present Government to stabilise the market position, particularly in Japan, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada- the countries to which we principally export- we still have a very grave problem of providing some stability in the beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I have an assurance, in view of the vagueness of the treatment accorded these boxers, that there will be some liaison between  Mr Mackellar,  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and  Mr Peacock,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, so that if necessary we can talk to Washington about this double standard that apparently is being applied by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that any watering down in relation to trade practice legislation which this Government attempts is the sort of watering down which would not be tolerated in a country like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where there is less ambivalence about the desirability of legislation of this kind and less ambivalence and confusion about what the Government really intends to do, about what the Government really supports in terms of business interests and what it really supports in terms of consumer interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at the cost of wages in Australia without considering what is known as the social wage- and I have seen a graph on this matter- it is pretty clear that in 1972 the Australian wage on a weekly basis and adjusted for currency differences and so on works out at something of the order of $3 or $4 a week below the <span class="highlight">United States</span> wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having convinced themselves, particularly the Treasurer,  Mr Lynch,  that the whole cause of our trouble was the size of the Budget deficit- we had great speeches in this place on this subject last year- the Government has single-mindedly taken the axe to all Government expenditure in an effort to reduce this deficit- a deficit which, incidentally, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, was very little greater last year than that of West Germany or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which are comparable countries in the Western world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In June 1974, under a Republican government, whose philosophy was much closer to that of this Government than would be that of a Democratic government with which perhaps we would have closer affiliations, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had a Budget deficit of $3.5 billion, which jumped in June 1975 to $43.6 billion and in June 1976 to $76 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he neglected to mention and what totally destroys the argument he tried to put forward is the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is held up by the medical profession in this country, the United Kingdom and by those reactionary sections of the medical profession anywhere in the world where a national health scheme operates as a perfect model of the practice of medicine incorporating the system of free enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because the rules of free enterprise apply to the practice of medicine in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; because the doctors are marketers of medical services, just like someone marketing automobiles or soap powder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The doctors market medical services and create their own demands for those medical services just as the car manufacturers of Detroit and the denizens of Madison Avenue create demands for any other commodity or service that is sold in the market place of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the question without notice which you directed to  Senator Guilfoyle,  as the Minister representing me in the Senate, on 8 September 1976, concerning the explosion at the Richland Uranium Plant in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on 30 August 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attached report which was obtained by the Government is in the form of an official news release from the Hanford office of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Energy Research and Development Administration, which states, inter alia … we will be issuing no further statements until significant findings have been made . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the work undertaken by the Victorian Country Roads Board whereby this crumbed rubber product is amalgamated with bitumen emulsion for road surfacing as this process is used extensively in the State of Arizona in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and is a proven technique, and in consideration of the high costs of bitumen in Australia and the consequent savings in money and bitumen that would result from this type of road surfacing, will the Minister take action to initiate discussions with the object of providing encouragement for expanding the use of this technique, not only in Victoria but also in the other States and the Commonwealth Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give consideration to the provision of funds sufficient to enable a visit to the Arizona Roads Authority in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by a representative of the federal Department of Transport and a roads engineer of the Victorian Country Roads Board, with the view to making the information obtained by such a visit available to the State and Commonwealth road authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these statements, I ask the Minister the following question: How does he reconcile his view that ‘there is no military significance’ attached to Omega with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy reports and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Defence Ministry reports which give a high strategic value to the Omega system in coordinating nuclear strikes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of evidence before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of this Parliament was against the honourable senator’s first premise which was that both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics regard Omega as being essential for nuclear strikes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the serious decision of the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to impose further quotas on Australian beef to the extent of 8 million lb on our previously determined quota, will the Minister obtain the names of those exporters who shipped excessive and unauthorised quantities of Australian beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> through Puerto Rico and Canada and so jeopardised the quotas available to orthodox exporters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion which the Opposition submits for the consideration of the Senate is designed to enable a public debate on the problems besetting the Australian beef industry and the very recent decision taken by  President  Ford- probably endorsed by the other Presidential candidate,  Mr Carter-  to suspend the importation of beef into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America from all beef exporting countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in its subservience to its big brother trading partner, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, it has done no more than to raise a mild protest at the latest decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Report after report has appeared in Australian newspapers of pressure by American cattlemen firstly on the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party and secondly on the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> cattlemen have made demands for some shutdown on imports of overseas beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You,  Mr Deputy President,  as a representative of them in this place would know that about 45 per cent of all production in the meat industry is destined for export markets and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market accounts for half of this tremendous amount of production in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in June 1 974, 291 548 tonnes ship weight were shipped from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the following year, the export to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> fell to 289 000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year, 298 000 tonnes of beef was exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that in the 3 years in question there have been very little differences in the amounts of beef exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  to impose statutory quotas on beef imports from Australia without prior consultation on an official or relevant level with Australian officials indicated the type of trade relationship and the lack of rapport into which this Government has quickly plunged Australia’s relations with one of our major trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision effectively means that Australia will have to renegotiate its quotas with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government which, in the present conditions of surplus exports, can only mean the likelihood of a substantial fall in Australian beef exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian conservative governments have claimed consistently in post-war years that they have a special relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a peculiar sort of special relationship if the actions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  in an election year are such as to demonstrate that he has little consideration of his responsibility to us in Australia and that he places our trading goodwill at the bottom of his priority list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to which both Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are signatories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is expected to be a very temporary dip, but even allowing for the dip our prices in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are still well above what they were a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s failure to establish a definite trade relationship with the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the limiting effect of this failure upon access to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> domestic market for Australian beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our meat trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has developed over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a very large bilateral trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and it is essentially a problem-free and happy relationship which is of mutual benefit to both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is not free at times in protecting its own producers; neither are we. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History would demonstrate that it is ridiculous to say that we have failed to develop a definite trade relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or to suggest that a relationship does not exist, as does the operative part of the motion we are debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a table which sets out the general exports of Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> meat imports over a period of time from various countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 Australia had 46.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ market; currently it has 51.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures demonstrate that except for the Central American area our trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has improved both in tonnage volume and in percentage volume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not really a bad record for a nation that is said to have no relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or has made a disaster of its trade relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to what I suppose is really the substance of this motion- our trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is not only important in absolute terms but also it is relatively important to other trading partners of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is our main source of imports, valued at about $1.7 billion in 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of our agricultural exports, valued at $500m in 1975-76, half of our total exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, beef and veal, accounted for $287m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> market for beef and veal is almost 3 times as valuable as it is for sugar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some decline in our overall trade pattern over the past 10 years in percentage of our exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of agricultural products, but there has been a great rise in the value of the exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> share of our exports has changed relatively little from 12 per cent to 10 per cent over the last 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our trade relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is not only strong but also static. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan has no formal trade agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is its largest partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a long-established trading partner of ours and it is not necessary to have formal bilateral agreements with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have found this to be similarly true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have close contact on trade matters with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, with consultations taking place in Canberra and Washington and also in other overseas countries and in many international fora in which we are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are the largest supplier, as the table will show, of meat imports into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is the largest importer of our beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has a very large domestic cattle population and a very large domestic cattle production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> situation is often much more involved in problems concerned with its seasons and the ratio of the price of grain to the price of beef in the market than it is with what we might believe to be discriminatory acts against Australia or other exporting countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of a formal trade agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has had no bearing on the action that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has taken in respect of beef imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> since 1964 has had a statute- the meat import law- which imposes certain mandatory requirements regarding the level of meat imports permitted into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A formula included in the meat import law calculates the level of various types of meat which may be imported into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in any calendar year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that imports of fresh, chilled and frozen beef, veal, mutton and goat meat should be limited to about 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> domestic production of these items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  may, however, suspend the operation of quotas if he determines that a level of imports higher than that which triggers the quotas is required in the national interest of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could have been more restrictive under its own laws than it has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The calculations and the comments about Canada, for instance, failed to take into account in some of the observations that were made that there is a common boundary between Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that a great amount of trade passes over that border between one side and the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is so because the rules are quite simple: If a message is to go to the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> it must come from the Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a message has been sent to the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a long message and it makes our situation quite clear to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does nothing for our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which, after all, is a large customer for our beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were to read the speech of  Senator Gietzelt  I do not think they would feel that they were dealing with friendly sellers; theymight think that they were dealing with other hostile people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The onlyother comment I wish to make is that again it would have been useful to have had a discussion on what is an important matter in this context, and that is the trilateral relationship in trade between ourselves, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan has a marked effect upon the trade both those countries have with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan is out of balance bilaterally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he did he would accept the motion as being a valid one, endeavouring to bring to the attention of the people, especially those who live in the rural sections of the country, the Government’s failure to establish with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a firm agreement on beef imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Gietzelt  is to be accused of making anti-American statements during his speech, then perhaps I ought to refer to the Premier of Queensland who engaged in some very sharp comments about the American decision to limit beef imports into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps also I ought to refer to the reverse situation of equal culpability, namely that the Minister for National Resources  (Mr Anthony)  rather glowingly anticipated the possibility that imports into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be increased beyond the basic import figures of the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present problem that we face with the export of our beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is one which we face continually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> either imposes import restrictions of some sort or uses the indirect method of imposing certain health or hygiene conditions on abattoirs causing them to close down, thus preventing the export of Australian beef, mainly to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By various devices the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has hindered the flow of Australian beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market and I am blaming the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s failure to establish a definite trade relationship with the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the limiting effect of this failure upon access to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> domestic market for Australian beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be a real measure of irony in a circumstance which sees the promotion of this motion tonight suggesting that we are failing to establish a better relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present context there are difficulties related to over-production in America, to the strength of the cattlemen ‘s lobby and, indeed, there are difficulties which all of us understand- I am sure the Opposition understands also- which are related to the sort of political pressures that exist at present in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion states that we should seek a definite trade relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had a definite and excellent trade relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that such a relationship has been dominantly and clearly the very essence of our trading relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> over practically the 70-odd years of federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is a great urgency for Australia to consolidate the market for beef in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> takes more than half of our export beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this motion has a political increment in it- of course, no one would suspect that that was so- it must surely seek to suggest that the problems of the Australian beef industry are directly referable to our failure to negotiate with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the contrary, as recently as 1975-76 Australia exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the second greatest amount of beef in the last 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of this industry relate not to our failures to negotiate with nor our failure to understand the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America but rather to a number of other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do most strongly say that the motion that is before us suggesting that we have not a proper trading relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is utter and complete piffle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was first diagnosed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for Science aware of the recently drafted Statement of Affirmation of Freedom of Inquiry and Expression by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Academy of Sciences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Academy of Sciences have urged their scientific colleagues around the world to join them in signing the statement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of information that I have received, that the attention of the  chairman  and the members of the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has recently been drawn to this document, I ask: Will the Minister ascertain whether they have signed or intend to sign the statement and notify the Senate accordingly, bearing in mind that a failure to sign the statement could adversely reflect on the CSIRO and jeopardise joint <span class="highlight">United States</span>-Australian scientific research projects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the best of my knowledge, there has been discussion about this matter, and a minute concerning the decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authority has come to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not recognise the disadvantage that may flow to Australia from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-Australia science agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The exchange of information between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been very freely given over a period of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should attempt to take the greatest advantage of the results of research that takes place in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America noted an object which was said to be 5000 million light years away from earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was mentioned in the second reading speech that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Advisory Commission on Inter-governmental Relations has been taken as a model for the body which this Bill will establish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly has published many reports, but what influence it has had in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is doubtful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government spokesmen in the second reading debate have informed us that the Advisory Council is modelled on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Advisory Commission which was established in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think it should be realised that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Advisory Commission is in no respect either a powerful or influential institution within the framework of American administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One only needs to think of the social problems and the infrastructure problems in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, least of all refer to them, to appreciate the grave difficulties that exist in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great nations of Europe and nations such as Canada, West Germany, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and even the United Kingdom have tested centralism, have found it failing and are setting up internal structures today to decentralise power, to devolve duties and to bring in federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in fact the socialist concept of centralism is being moved aside, particularly in Western Europe, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada, and in its place is a new and exciting concept of bringing government closer and closer to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time there is a stranglehold on the creative production process in Australia, very extensive arrangements for the cheap importation of commercial television programs from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and a situation in which there is not one body in Australia, including the Government, which seems to be seriously concerned with the sort of cultural development we get when, as I said, children of primary school age are watching television for more hours than they are attending school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately the question of whether Australian children will be brought up with a secondhand culture and secondhand experiences obtained from television or whether they are to be involved in more creative experiences of a first-hand kind will of course depend on Australians; it will not depend on the importation of pap from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- or it might do, tragically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister support these projects; if so, will the Minister ensure that funds are immediately made available to enable these scientists to continue their research by financing a trip to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to make use of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Arizona. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-65-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the United Kingdom and France and practically every other country in the Western world are in a desperate position when it comes to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as I pointed out earlier to  Senator Walters,  in the United Kingdom and in most other Western countries the problem of unemployment is inherent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the people of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> went to the polls only yesterday or early this morning Australian time, probably nearly all the votes for governors and senators have been counted, and with perhaps 80 million votes to be counted, the new  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is probably known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister confident that Australia will be able to maintain at least our present trade with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will recall that some time ago he told me, following my testimony before  Mr Justice  Hope who was looking at the restructuring of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, that he thought that reports were coming through to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  that they could be released, and that probably they would indicate that we should have what they have in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there are at least 4 leading senators who are on talking terms with members of certain security agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one looks at what has happened recently in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> I think one will see that, had there been a proper surveillance or an earlier surveillance of the Central Intelligence Agency, the congressional inquiries into that organisation that have been going on for the past 12 months or 2 years would not have occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the strong points he made was that, in his opinion, had there been proper surveillance of the funds being spent by intelligence agencies in America at an earlier date perhaps the present situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would not have arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all of these proceedings, claims are being made that the antitrust and related laws of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have an extremely wide operation outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the claims that are being made for extra-territorial operation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> laws go further that this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They go so far as to assert that persons who are not <span class="highlight">United States</span> nationals or residents or persons carrying on business in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are subject to those laws by reason only of some economic effect of their conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, such claims were resisted by the United Kingdom in 1964 in connection with an attempt by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities to regulate shipping between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Legislation was enacted to ensure that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> claims would not be effective, and I refer honourable senators in this connection to the United Kingdom Shipping Contracts and Commercial Documents Act 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In connection with the present dispute concerning uranium, Canada has recently made a regulation indicating that it rejects the jurisdiction being asserted by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities as an unjustified invasion of its sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the current <span class="highlight">United States</span> proceedings relating to uranium are concerned, I can inform the Senate that the Attorney-General is satisfied there is a need to make orders under the proposed legislation and he will be taking action in this regard as soon as the legislation has been passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He asked, among other things, a question about the current <span class="highlight">United States</span> inquiry in relation to uranium price fixing or other breaches of <span class="highlight">United States</span> antitrust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought- and I detect in the second reading speech a suspicion on the part of the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Ellicott)-  that it would have been possible for us to rely on our courts to assert the limitations on the extra-territorial operation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust laws which is spelt out more definitely in this Bill <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would have no real opportunity and no real chance of asserting the claims which the Westinghouse Corporation is purporting to assert in these proceedings but I think that it is high time that the Government of Australia had something to say about its notion of these limitations on extra-territorial operation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the letters of request which are issued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> court which is seized of the matter were issued by that court on 25 October and that no advice was even received by anybody in Australia until 28 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably more important than the position of certain Australian companies is the very principle of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust legislation and the wide impact it has on conduct outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and on citizens of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I entirely agree with him that it is something that the Government ought to be closely considering and discussing with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister seen the assertion in the  Australian  of 8 November 1976 by  Mr Peter  Clyne, a well known Sydney legal figure, that his Australian passport is still in the hands of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Clyne  ‘s passport is in the hands of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities, was he issued with a travel document to return from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Clyne travelled from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to Canada without a travel document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having in mind that citizen band operators are licensed in other parts of the world- as an example, it is reported that some 13 million CB transmitters in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are licensed and have been accommodated on 40 channels- what is the attitude of the Australian Government to bringing about a licensing scheme to allow CB operators in this country to operate legally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am advised also that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal Communications Commission agrees with unofficial estimates that there are about 13 million sets of this equipment in that country where it has been legalised in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is that the venture of legalisation of CB radio in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and elsewhere has struck very many difficulties and very many problems, most of which are not resolved as yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of interference with the technical operation of other equipment, including hi fi sets and electronic organs, so I am advised, new specifications for that equipment are to be introduced into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> from 1 January next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to an article in the  Australian Financial Review  by Robert Hangst which refers to the export of beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Why did the Minister’s advisers, in a recent letter to me, deny that some Australian exporters are trying to beat the system and are disadvantaging the legitimate exporters of Australian beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I do not know how much beef the writer for the  Financial Review  has ever produced or tried to sell but I was interested in the proposition that what we needed was a good negotiating hand in this matter in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, there has been much conjecture about what has been happening in the area of beef exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For my own interest I have tried to find out about them to get a true picture and I could not help feeling from a study of the situation that the Japanese position and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> position were partly connected with the current elections in both those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware that in 1974 an agreement was entered into between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for the exchange of information concerning the development of solar energy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These texts should be revised now that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has passed an Act to convert to the metric system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague  Senator Sibraa  saw the <span class="highlight">United States</span> settlement of Vietnamese refugees and, from his report, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been far more successful than we have, despite the huge numbers it took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was amazed at the number of people who commented to me on a series of television advertisements that were then being shown in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by Qantas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also anybody who went to a travel agency in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or who went into any of the major places to purchase tickets was confronted by some extremely good brochures which were on display and which were the basis of promotional efforts to sell package tours and to attract people from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are one or two places in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America that have developed this form of transport and it is proving to be quite satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That has relevance insofar as it affects our arrangements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada in relation to our double taxation agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point is that there is no clear statement that as yet an agreement has been reached with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada over whether or not they have the same corresponding definition of royalty as is set down in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further point was raised by  Senator Messner  that there have been discussions with Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to revise the double taxation agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at just 2 companies- 2 closely related companies- which are operating in this field in Queensland, namely, the Utah Development Corporation, which is 89 per cent owned by Utah International of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and Central Queensland Coal Associates, 85 per cent of which is owned by Utah Development and 15 per cent by Mitsui. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some sections of the industry are unable to compete favourably with other suppliers such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Poland, Canada, South Africa and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics because of the duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is presumed that the second part of the question relates to exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The restriction of access of our beef, for example, to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Canada is a more recent example of the fact that it is not so much the price factor that affects us as the decision made domestically within other countries to protect their own domestic production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had questions and discussion and public comment about the dumping of beef on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there was the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, then Canada, then the Philippines and then Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do, why did the Government not use them against the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is supposed to be the country with which this Government has philosophical, ideological and close working relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it did not make any threats against the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, although trade between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia is 2 times in its favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has so little intelligence information from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan, the Philippines and other countries that we were not able to ‘guestimate’ what was to happen; we were not able to understand the pressures under which the Government would be placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent decision of the Minister on the way in which the export quota to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is to be allocated may seriously disadvantage the industry in Tasmania and Northern Queensland, where the killing is seasonal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had quota problems relative to political situations and lobbying in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somewhat unscrupulous exporters, who no doubt were in league with their counterpart importers in America, were caught sending meat into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> against the law, resulting of course in cuts in Australia’s export quota to America- a country which traditionally has taken more than SO per cent of our meat exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The VFU pastoral division is concerned over the recent announcement by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President, Mr Ford,  that the U.S. meat imports will be limited this calendar year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second problem- I call it a problem because I think it is a problem- is the dependence on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason why I think it is a problem that we are related so much to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is that <span class="highlight">United States</span> standards of slaughtering are very high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been indicated that most freights to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will rise by 22 per cent on top of the 12 per cent announced in October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will make it almost impossible for producers in the Territory to ship out to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figure given to me was $83.60 and this was based on <span class="highlight">United States</span> standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When considering the <span class="highlight">United States</span> markets and some of the Territory’s other markets, one wonders whether the devaluation will be of any help at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt talked about the <span class="highlight">United States</span> beef market and the 1976 quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, quotas were set by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government at the level of voluntary restraint quotas under which Australia was already exporting to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government does not favour quotas for many reasons and fought them very hard at the highest level, the fact remains that our exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in 1976 will be similar to the levels of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our shipping program to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was almost complete when the quotas were announced by  President  Ford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  and I had a quite amicable chat across the chamber about this when I observed that I thought part of the problem at the moment with Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was the fact that they were involved in election situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt spoke about the Australian Meat Board’s new export scheme for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that context- with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> levelling itself off, with our numbers expanding and with our being denied access to the European Economic Community market- a very difficult position arose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to introduce a new Federal court which will denude them of a great deal of their work and thereby go a long way towards creating a system such as has developed under the federal system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where there are parallel court systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a warning label, similar to that required by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Food and Drug Administration, drawing attention to the possible dangers of taking phenacetin should be required on all preparations containing phenacetin when sold without prescription; the warning should read as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If wool costs to the overseas buyer in terms of <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars, yen, Deutschmarks or sterling had remained constant, would prices in Australian dollars have increased by 21.9 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Immediately the construction of an off-shore quarantine station is completed it will be possible to import cattle, sheep, pigs and goats through the station from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and Europe, including areas where foot and mouth disease is present, and also Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether reports in the Dunedin  Evening Star  and the Christchurch  Star  of Saturday, 9 October 1976 that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> planned to ship 6500 cubic metres of soil contaminated by radioactivity from the McMurdo Sound nuclear power generator in the Antarctic are accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was particularly so either yesterday or the day before when he asked whether I knew about some scientific agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on solar research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no such agreement, but perhaps he thought there was or perhaps he was mistakenly referring to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-Australian agreement generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without being at all boastful, I point out that in my maiden speech in August 1965 I did lean heavily on the thoughts of Stewart Udall, who was the Secretary of the Interior in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as expressed in a book he wrote called  The Quiet Crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know the problems that are created when industry is disrupted, particularly the intensive industrialised countries such as Japan, Germany and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, to cite but three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking further at the crude oil situation, Russia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are today conserving their crude oil as much as possible because there is a need for the longer term production of industrial feed stocks of such things as drugs and fertilisers which will be needed in future years, fertilisers to assist in food production and drugs to assist in the welfare of humanity itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada and Iran have opted for nuclear power to a certain extent to protect their dwindling fossil fuel sources, their dwindling oil sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the Tokamak experiments in the U.S.S.R. and other experiments m the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are showing the way; we will have fusion power in perhaps 20 or 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Alvin  Weinberg, who was the Director of the nuclear laboratory at Oak Ridge in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> until 1973 and who is in favour of nuclear power, has said that we need to recruit a dedicated priesthood to guard nuclear wastes and reactors and keep them nonpolluting in perpetuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The serious concern about nuclear reactor safety, especially after the incident at Browns Ferry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where an electrician with a candle almost caused a tragedy, and what to do with reactors after their 30 or 40 years’ life is up are real problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would regret it if the arguments about the export of a few thousand tonnes from Mary Kathleen, which will make no difference to the world ‘s attitude to nuclear power and which will make no difference to the supplies which go to Japan, West Germany and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, should become the basis of the very real argument which  Mr Justice  Fox and the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry have brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Attempts that were being made by <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities to procure evidence for the purposes of proceedings in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America caused the Government to introduce the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did so because the emphasis of the resolution was on condemning the presence of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> military installations on the island of Guam rather than on reflecting the situation in the territory and the aspirations of the people of the territory as to their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to an article in the Australian Financial Review by Robert Haupt which refers to the export of beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Why did the Minister’s advisers, in a recent letter to me, deny that some Australian exporters are trying to beat the system and are disadvantaging the legitimate exporters of Australian beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by the Acting Minister for Overseas Trade that the suggestion made in the article by Robert Haupt that Australian exporters had ‘beaten the system’ of <span class="highlight">United States</span> import controls is misleading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is it correct that, in relation to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> StateLocal Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress rejected the proposed concept of the automatic tie-in of general revenue-sharing payments as a fixed percentage of either the annual federal personal income tax base or of annual federal personal income tax revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> State-Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 makes possible a system of federal collection of State personal income taxes through the machinery of the Federal Internal Revenue Service similar to the proposal that the present Australian Government has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence and relates to allegations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, particularly in the  Washington Post,  that sub-standard parts have been sold to foreign military forces which use <span class="highlight">United States</span> parts in their helicopter fleets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a classic case in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America not so long ago in which a small- I emphasise the word ‘small ‘; perhaps it was even minute- group of Croats for a propaganda exercise hijacked a <span class="highlight">United States</span> aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 30 November  Senator Bonner  asked me as Minister representing the Minister for National Resources whether I was aware that the Iranian Government had recently cancelled a SUS5.6 billion project to export liquefied gas to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Europe, the American company named being the El Paso Natural Gas Company and if so, whether the feasibility had been explored of further developing our country’s reputed vast reserves of this commodity on a viable basis so as to capture part of the lucrative overseas market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and selected European nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it would take 20 to 24 months to obtain the Federal Power Commission’s approval to import the gas into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, thus further endangering the economics of the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this work has attracted considerable interest overseas, it is hoped that the results obtained by CSIRO will provide the basis for a fruitful information exchange between Australia and other countries, such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which are devoting impressively large sums to oil-from-coal research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are reports in the  Dunedin Evening Star  and the  Christchurch Star  of 9 October 1976 that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America plans to ship 6500 cubic metres of soil contaminated by radioactive material from the McMurdo Sound nuclear power generator in the Antarctic accurate; if so, does this proposal involve a violation of Article 5 of the Antarctic Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to information provided by <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities, a routine inspection in 1972 of the McMurdo Sound nuclear reactor revealed some evidence of wetting of insulating material by shield water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the 6500 cubic metres of soil mentioned in the honourable senator’s question, it is understood that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has advised the New Zealand authorities that it proposes to ship approximately this amount of soil from McMurdo Sound through Lyttleton in February 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister no doubt is well aware of the recent oil spillage around the coast of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of Amenca from vessels with rather questionable safety standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister ask the Treasurer to investigate the feasibility of pressing special one dollar coins as is done in other countries such as Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there appears to be, according to the Paper, little prospect of an agreement between the 2 super-powers, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, to limit existing armaments in the Indian Ocean or to deal with any possible build-up in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it indicates that Australia might be forced politically to re-assess its defence arrangements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the election of the new  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, there appears to be a move towards making the strategic arms limitation discussions effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any agreements can be reached then the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, for example, although remaining strong militarily, might not be able to supply as much manpower, technical and equipment support to the countries with whom it has normally been associated as friendly powers as it has done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility is more likely if the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  is able to achieve an effective reduction in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the major powers such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan and probably the Soviet Union regard as important free and unhindered access to certain areas such as the Arabian Gulf, Indonesia, Malacca and the Sunda and Lombok Straits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The White Paper implies that Australia would rely on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to deploy a force based on Diego Garcia or its Middle East fleet to maintain freedom of access to these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a country which over the years has dealt in a much bigger way with the problem of the enormous cost involved in maintaining this type of vessel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all, in order to simulate an attack by a sporadic raid on the Australian coast we had to obtain from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America a force to represent a regimental combat team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we had a <span class="highlight">United States</span> marine regimental combat team to produce that portion of the exercise, with its vertical take-off and landing aircraft, its cover coming from the vast resources of the nuclear carrier  Enterprise,  and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had it been left to honourable senators opposite and had there been people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Great Britain and France who were as silly as they are, China would still be isolated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would recommend to supporters of the Government that they peruse some of the recent very well informed statements of one of the Democratic members- probably the best informed Democratic member- of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives Committee on the Armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are spread across an area as great as that of the continental <span class="highlight">United States</span>, exclusive of Alaska. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that  Senator Wheeldon  felt that the capacity of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was so infinitely below the capacity of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not the evidence to suggest that the U.S.S.R. military, naval and air capacity is so far below that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly gained the impression there that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy places a very low priority on the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also pointed out to me that whenever the  Enterprise  is in the Indian Ocean the balance of power- if one wants to use that expression- because of fire power is overwhelmingly in favour of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the briefing that I received the officers gave me the impression that they thought that if there were any major conflict in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy was involved, that conflict would take place in the Atlantic Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact they said that if a conflict took place in the Atlantic, both the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would pull whatever ships they had out of the Indian Ocean and return them to the Atlantic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there has been a lot of talk and speculation that Australia needs the F16 from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at a cost of approximately $ 17m each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been put to me on more than one occasion, and it has also been mentioned in the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America by a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the U.S. Senate,  Senator John  Culver, that in evidence taken by the U.S. Committee it was shown that the U.S. had not criticised the Soviet’s buildup in Berbera as might have been expected for the simple reason that it did not want a public outcry until it had completed the facilities at Diego Garcia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what we have to say about that now, because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> took this low posture on the Soviet Union’s stance in Berbera, Diego Garcia as a base is practically completed and we do have a super power buildup in the Indian Ocean whether we like it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our alliance with the U.S. gives substantial grounds for confidence that in the event of a fundamental threat to Australia’s security <span class="highlight">United States</span> military support would be forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is known that insurgents in the north-east of Thailand and indeed m the south of Thailand are now being armed with some of the most modern <span class="highlight">United States</span> weapons which were left behind in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main concern at the moment is the policy of the new administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and what priority it will give to its relations with South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fear is that, if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> regards South East Asia as an area of low priority, the only two major powers left to compete are the Soviet Union and China, without the balancing effect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has a distinct advantage in trade and technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be quite unreal not to expect the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to exploit this advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface, I refer to a plea that I made to the Minister in January to discourage Liberian and Panamanian flag oil tankers on the Australian coast and to encourage, under the provisions of the Navigation Act, only double-bottomed tankers, as is the policy in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost disability of Australia compared with its normal trading partners, compared with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for instance, which accounts for one-third of our overseas trade, deteriorated by 33 per cent between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has seen to it that there is a division of responsibility that is the counterpart of the more advanced management practices of treasuries in the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Scandinavian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is taking a course of action which is being pursued by this Government But it is quite contrary to the course of action being taken by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where similar problems of inflation and unemployment exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unemployment and inflation increased in every one of those countries, whether it be Australia, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan or West Germany- the land of the post-war economic miracle, the so-called wirtschaftswunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past 10 years average weekly earnings in Australia rose by 178.3 per cent, compared to a rise in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of 72 per cent- over 100 per cent more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr Fraser  announced devaluation he stressed that from then on our currency would be on a managed float, the same as the currencies of many other industrial countries in the West such as Japan, Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that rate is some 5 per cent; in Japan it is about 9 per cent; and in Germany it is about 3.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some justification of Labor’s economic plan as laid down by  Mr Hurford  has been claimed on the basis that the new  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>,  President  Carter, has decided to adopt a plan involving big spending, the creation of a deficit and tax cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures that I have just cited make quite clear the difference in the nature of the problem between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This resurgence has been clearly evident in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and West Germany where the rates of inflation for the first 9 months of 1976 were 3.9 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But  Dr Richards  gives a history and some proof of the theory that during the investigation of atomic expansion after the Second World War a tripartite agreement was entered into at Quebec between Canada, Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for the exchange of information on atomic energy, chemical and biological warfare and rocketry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this development of parliamentary law we were most advantaged by the fact that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, that great federal democracy, the constitution of whose Senate might be looked for more than this item of current events, the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the courts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have had to deal with the problem of transcendent invasion of the integrity of government in that state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then followed the decision of the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most interesting point about that decision is not that it discovered the secrets of the  President  and compelled his confidential aides to disclose their scandalous conduct but that the decision of the great judicial authority of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court considered the confluence of 2 streams of authority, one applying to the courts of law and the other applying to the legislature, namely, Congress itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was asked to order the discovery of the President’s confidential diaries- increasingly in the form of tapesdictated by him to his aides and their response, the Court stated that in the absence of a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets, the confidentiality of the President’s communications is not significantly diminished by producing material for a criminal trial under protected  in camera  inspection by the court and that the President’s claim for privilege on the ground of a generalised interest in confidentiality- precisely the same ground as put forward by  Mr Whitlam  when he was Prime Minister and by his learned Ministers -must yield to the exigencies of a criminal trial, and that the tapes should be produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus was resurrected a strength in the judicial administration of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which redeemed it from the disgrace to which it had descended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cavanagh  referred to an agreement between the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that  Senator Cavanagh  probably had in mind the articles of agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom in the matter of tube alloys signed by Messrs Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec on 19 August 1943. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing wrong in a government bringing in its own men, however partisan they may be or however dedicated to a particular political view, provided that with a change of government their services can be terminated, as happens in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> those who are appointed by the  President  as secretaries of departments are akin to Ministers of the Crown in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, when a government goes then those secretaries of departments who have been appointed by the  President  for the life of the government go with the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course one would have thought this until he drew the analogy, quite wrongly, of what is happening under this legislation and what happens in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and until he referred to the Department of the Media as Labor’s propaganda department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that was not enough, General Yoga Sugama, the head of the infamous intelligence service, added fuel to the fire- that is, if he is reported correctly- by saying that Indonesia was taking steps to prevent  Mr Dunn’s  appearance before a <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That could lead to moves in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to bring pressure on the Indonesian Government to cease its military activities in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is patently obvious, I believe, that the Indonesian Government is worried that this alleged evidence of atrocities will reinforce criticism in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on the human rights issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is concerned about this matter and that the Indonesian Government is concerned that this public scrutiny could lead to Congress cutting back on aid, particularly military aid to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if we go further and relate these figures to the changes in the hourly wage rates in manufacturing between 1972 and 1976 we find that in that period in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America there was an increase of nearly 39 per cent in that rate; in Japan a 53 per cent increase; in Germany a 43 per cent increase; in the United Kingdom an increase of 109.5 per cent; and in Australia an increase of 100.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the 1 1 countries shown- Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom- where the gross domestic product was divided by the labour force to produce the gross domestic product per member of the labour force, Australia rated seventh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same speech, as recorded on page 145 of  Hansard,  there is a paragraph concerning the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to part of which I take exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing to be said about them is that the uncertainty about the future course of Australian policy, the doubts, reservations and acrimony which were so much a feature of the previous Government’s dealings with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, have been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not true to say that there was any deterioration in the relationship between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had the good futune to be in that country on 3 occasions during those 3 years and at no time was there any evidence of any concern, with one exception which I will mention, about the relationship between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered also that the Australian Labor Party over the years has consistently supported the ANZUS Treaty believing it to be the proper, intelligent and fair treaty by which we should have our ties with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> rather than through the South East Asian Treaty Organisation which virtually is meaningless these days and which we in the 1950s and 1960s predicted would become meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not know in what areas the Minister proposes to improve our relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in some respects he will be able to convince the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to take more of our exports, particularly beef, as time goes by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the great problems we face in the region at the moment is the uncertainty as to the policies of the new <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration towards ASEAN and the region in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this uncertainty as to <span class="highlight">United States</span> policies there appears to be a desire amongst ASEAN members to have much closer relationships with Japan and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that one ofthe great problems which face ASEAN countries is that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> takes little interest in them there will arise the problem ofthe Sino-Soviet conflict which at the moment is very real in competing for influence amongst the ASEAN countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a strong desire not only to maintain <span class="highlight">United States</span> presencean investment presence as well as a political presence- in the region as a balancing factor but also to ensure that there is a growing Japanese interest in the region, again to balance the presence of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China which in itself creates uncertainty and some degree of instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a danger of a third world war, a major conflict, taking place I do not think that any longer can we look at the disputes between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union, between the so-called capitalist world and the so-called socialist world, or between the democratic world and the authoritarian world; we have to look at something about which we as members of the Australian Parliament can do very little, and that is the problem of the dispute between Peking and Moscow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important changes, one ofthe most revolutionary changes, one of the most heartening changes that has taken place or appears to be going to take place- it is early at this stage to say whether it will really take placehave been the statements made and the actions taken by  President  Carter since he was elected to the presidency ofthe <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Socialist Party in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is very small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can see a parallel at the present time- we are yet to know what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America will do about this- in the very vexed situation which exists in what once was Portuguese East Timor, where we find that the rights of the Timorese people have been taken away by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest that not only is it right and proper that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should object to the deprivation of civil liberties in South Africa and Rhodesia, but in the long run it is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It behoves Australia to align itself with, and if anything to strengthen the stand taken by, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America Government on these issues because not only is that stand right and moral, but also it is in our own interests to take such a stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not given real assistance either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trying to press the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to expand its naval and military presence in the Indian Ocean is not a way of dealing with the existing problems in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should feel embarrassed when it appears that the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is putting forward a policy contrary to that which this Government has expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not be taking steps towards demilitarising the area if we encourage the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to create a new base in Diego Garcia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relationship of this country with Japan, with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and with the European Economic Community is of extreme importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, of course, is basic in some real measure to the security of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will retain with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the sort of co-operation and communication which it has always been our intention to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>guidelines, his sail or his flag towards achieving a decrease in military activity around the world and a rapport with the previous enemies of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, in particular the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seem to have a great hang-up about a requirement to fawn on the Pentagon in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and over the years we have fawned on the U.S.A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have also been changes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, one of the superpowers of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing to be said about them is that the uncertainty about the future course of Australian policy, the doubts, reservations and acrimony which were so much a feature of the previous Government’s dealings with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, have been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that relationships between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia had never really changed and that they have not changed now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable senators opposite may think that but, unfortunately, certain senior members of the Labor Party saw the need to pass derogatory remarks about certain senior people and leaders within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has done so much in so many ways and, as is often the case, there is very little recognition of it and very little appreciation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By working with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America perhaps we can play an ever increasing role in this very important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have been critical of the fact that within that alliance we tended again to trot along like the little dog behind the giant <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope we continue to have that alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be up to countries like Australia, Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to do all they can to assist in the further development of nations in this very important region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope we will do what so many other countries, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Russia, have already done, and that is to lay claim to the 200 miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to that section of the foreign policy statement that dealt with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing to be said about them is that the uncertainty about the future course of Australian policy, he doubts, reservations and acrimony which were so much a feature ofthe previous Government’s dealings with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, have been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ambassador to Australia,  Mr Marshall  Green, who said that after an initial period of some difficulty with the new Labor Government he felt that relations between the 2 countries, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia under that government, perhaps had never been better and had never been more frank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Minister has not taken into consideration statements continually made by political leaders in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and leaders of past and present <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administrations that the present Western military strength is at least equal to and in many respects far superior to that of the Soviet Union and its allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> strategic forces are superior in accuracy, diversity, reliability, survivability and numbers of separately  targetable  nuclear warheads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, as the Committee found, has a low commitment in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the Presidential campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite statements concerning consultations with traditional allies, I think we have to recognise that Australia may be even more on the periphery of <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy than it has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will require a reassessment of our relationship and our alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, our relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> may need to be supplemented by a more integrated relationship with Japan and the countries of ASEAN. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that our relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will be more diverse and complex and possibly a much more substantial relationship in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should agree to the proposal; secondly, that the Soviet Union should agree to the proposal; and, thirdly, that both super-powers then should completely remove all their forces, bases and any other facilities from the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again my belief that, as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had a bigger military force in that country than we did, it has a bigger obligation than we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was able to gain the confidence of countries which were a little wary of the super powers, whether it was the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Soviet Union or China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long while, until the Whitlam Government came to power, we were always asking what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between the wars it used to be Britain; at that time it was the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great <span class="highlight">United States</span> General, Matthew Ridgway, the man who had to take over after General MacArthur and get the <span class="highlight">United States</span> out of Korea, suggested that one of the lessons to be learnt was that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should never again send its infantry to mainland Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that when I am paying tribute to people who tried to steer the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America away from becoming involved in war I should refer to  Senator Eugene  McCarthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not gain a place in the White House but he was one of the first of the few people who questioned whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> foreign policy was correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was very important in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Western <span class="highlight">United States</span> has the technology to harness water to grow much more food but Gov. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reliable statistics from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America state that 127 000 baby harp seals from a total population of 200 000 were slaughtered in 1976 to provide furs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether the Government has investigated reports which indicate that the Carter Administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has accorded  de jure  recognition to Indonesian incorporation of East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what do these investigations indicate with respect to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ stand on this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government understands that in answer to a question from a member of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House Asian and Pacific Affairs Sub-committee on 17 March,  Mr Robert  Oakley,  Deputy  Assistant Secretary of State, said, among other things, that the Carter Administration had accepted the decision of the Ford Administration ‘to go along with’ the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and refer to the Australian visit of a specialised plane from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science: Is it a fact that at the meeting of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research in the Argentine last October the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was asked to make every effort to obtain Landsat imagery over the whole of the Antarctic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister indicate what progress the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of years not only the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but also this country and a number of other countries have been interested in gaining satellite imagery of resources and, indeed, of the whole earth surface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The thrust of the question from the Leader of the Opposition was whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had been successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the honourable senator would agree that I would be unable to state whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> considered it had been successful in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that five other nations, which include both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union, believe that there should be no territorial claims by any individual nation under that agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and refer to an answer which he gave yesterday on <span class="highlight">United States</span> policy toward East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is he aware that  Mr Oakley,  the <span class="highlight">United States</span> official whom he quoted yesterday, stated to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional hearing on East Timor this morning Australian time that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> did not formally recognise the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this position, as stated by  Mr Oakley,  will the Minister ascertain the attitude of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities and inform the Senate accordingly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia in this matter, which is at present before a congressional committee in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are debating here is a proposal for a maximum price of $2 a box of apples up to 2 million boxes sold at risk in markets in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and a maximum subsidy in relation to pears of 80 cents a box up to 1.4 million boxes for sale at risk in markets in Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this very moment one of the members of the staff of the Legislative Research Service in this Parliament is attending a committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress to give evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact I recall that when I was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange the General Counsel of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission came to Australia and gave evidence to our Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesian Government itself has been providing evidence or information to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives Committee which is examining this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Committee cannot compel anybody outside the borders of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or anybody within those borders who has diplomatic immunity to give evidence but it is still managing to hold an inquiry about a country much farther from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> than Timor is from Australia and much less important to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> than Timor is to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives has agreed to hold this inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has already indicated a virtual  de facto  recognition of Indonesia’s presence in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only 2 days ago Australia was accused in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of not having done anything about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer should be sent back by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>: ‘Australia has not set up an inquiry because we want mature and adult relationships with Indonesia and we do not want to offend the Indonesians in any way’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from the transcript of the interview with Congressman Fraser in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> relating to a congressional committee hearing in America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Congressman Fraser: While the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been a principal military supplier to the Government of Indonesia for the past decade, there appears now to be substantial evidence that <span class="highlight">United States</span> military equipment was used by the Indonesian forces in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Congressman Fraser: Well implicitly they have because we’ve discovered now, to our surprise, that is those of us in the House, that last year, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government suspended new commitments to Indonesia for a period of 6 months, apparently because our Government believes that our military equipment was being used in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should recognise that as far as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is concerned, it is perhaps catching up from a position somewhat behind ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there has been the same sort of concentrated interested in this little speck north of us- an important part of an island as far as we are concerned- by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as it is probably of less importance to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is now catching up and taking interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to refer to later reports of which we know, one now being the subject of inquiry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our major competitors in those markets are Chile, the Argentine, New Zealand, South Africa and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, I understand that the countries I have mentioned export this commodity under a single brand concept, enabling shipping and distribution costs to be decreased in comparison with those of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has to be much more detailed investigation of Middle East and far eastern markets so that we can compete with Chile, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Government ‘s professed distaste for apartheid and support for the American alliance, will it consider taking the same sorts of steps as are envisaged in this regard by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is rather out of our area but obviously as everybody knows it has commitments and involvements in our area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one considers the capital structure one sees that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is entitled to make a higher claim against Japan for the presidency of the Bank than Australia is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement we are looking at does note some change in the position of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America following  President  Carter’s election and this needs to be examined by an Australian delegation for the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The law in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> prohibits recruitment of any persons as mercenaries within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but does not prohibit a citizen or other person in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> leaving the country to enlist in a foreign military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is a current proposal by  President  Carter to remove the office of Attorney-General from the American Cabinet to try to sustain that kind of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were openly recruited in democratic western European countries, Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was commenting on a report from Washington broadcast on Radio Australia which quoted unnamed <span class="highlight">United States</span> State Department sources as saying that Indonesian forces had used napalm against the nationalist Fretilin movement late last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An official State Department spokesman was quoted as saying that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government believed that napalm was not being used now and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had not supplied any napalm to Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nobody is sure how many people were killed but in another type of invasion, assisted by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Central Intelligence Agency, in Indonesia some years ago at the time of the overthrow of Sukarno a large number of people were killed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the previous Ford Administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the present Carter Administration have accorded  de facto  recognition to Indonesian incorporation of East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth noting that the Carter Administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has accorded what seems to me to be very clearly  de facto  recognition of Indonesian incorporation of East Timor- a position with which the Australian Government does not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was one of a group of senators which recently asked the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  to take action on this particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sending that petition it was my hope that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration might take some action on this matter along the lines that the Australian Government has taken and, thereby, add weight to those representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of evidence of the Indonesian representative in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> I think we must seek clarification from the Indonesian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involves Portugual, Indonesia, Timor, Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in different ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Congressman Fraser of the Congressional Committee in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which is examining some aspects of this matter said recently: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are obvious examples of this sort of thing occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Brazil are examining its value as an energy source and a number of countries are studying its use in paper pulp manufacture, an outlet of increasing importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the situation which developed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in 1973 following the voluntary price freeze, when food prices rose by 20 per cent, wholesale commodity prices rose by 22.2 per cent and wholesale farm produce prices jumped by nearly 50 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very high ratio to population compared with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion of multilevel regional colleges in the context in which  Dr Armstrong  developed it and which has been developed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and elsewhere has a lot of sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is quite correct in indicating that a news release which I put out approximately a week ago stated that some <span class="highlight">United States</span> scientists from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration- that is, a group called NOAAare in Australia at the moment to hold discussions with both my Department and the Bureau of Meteorology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It commenced in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> modification of 4 storms has been attempted during the period of operation of the project by the technique of cloud seeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the multiple seeding of a cyclone named Debbie in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in 1969 yielded the most encouraging results in that a reduction of maximum wind velocity by about 31 per cent was observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is interested in extending the operation of project Stormfury into the southern hemisphere, no commitment has been entered into by the respective governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from legal and political considerations, extension to Australia will proceed only if the nature and frequency of the type of storm that is experienced here suggest that they are suitable for the project and the necessary logistic arrangements can be made and the present <span class="highlight">United States</span> team feels that the situation is satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following  Senator Drake-Brockman  ‘s question, which related particularly to Carnarvon, I give the honourable senator an assurance that I shall immediately seek to influence the <span class="highlight">United States</span> team to call at Carnarvon and take advice from the Carnarvon Shire Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When Dean Roscoe Pound speaks of the immunities of labour unions- they are not the same in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America as they are in Australia but they are very similar with a different but not dissimilar history- he points out in the opening gambit of his treatise: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the relationship between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Indonesia does not appear to have been harmed by the recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional International Relations Committee holding an inquiry into the allegations of atrocities in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is based on a fundamental constitutional theorem which exists in the English speaking world, whether it be in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or in Australia in 1977, and that is that in circumstances of peace the conduct of foreign affairs lies in the area of the prerogative power; it does not lie in the area of the parliamentary power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first message that came over was a call for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> team to ask to visit Fretilin leaders and the reaction around that group of 7 people was that that was a good idea; let the Americans talk to the Fretilin leaders and find out what was going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to the recent report of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Transportation Study Board dealing with an intensive study of the lifestyle of pilots, in and out of the cockpit, to see whether fatigue and imprecise crew communications are major factors in airline accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were lucky that we were following in the footsteps of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate, which has advocated advisory councils in the interests of better relations between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> forestry service, conservation groups and the public in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As pan of our defence relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, there have grown up extensive arrangements for exchanging information and views with a wide range of <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government agencies including those in the intelligence and security field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these arrangements officers from <span class="highlight">United States</span> agencies are declared to the Australian authorities and work with various Australian agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are an important aspect of the close and intimate relationship which we have with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through these arrangements we have access to and exchange valuable information with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on a wide range of international strategic developments as well as security and intelligence matterssuch as espionage and international terrorism to name 2 examples- which contribute in the broadest terms to the protection of Australia and the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection I wish to reassure the nation that I have carefully reviewed the activities of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government in Australia and have found them to be fully consistent with the interests and policies of the Australian Government and people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied with the assurances I have received from elements of my own Government and from President Carter personally through his Ambassador that neither the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government not its representatives are involved in improper or inappropriate activities here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will also be aware that, in recent times, the activities of the CIA, unlike most other foreign intelligence services, have been kept under close scrutiny by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress; and that allegations of improper activity will be investigated as a matter of routine by the Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the Leader, when Prime Minister, sought and was advised of the names of representatives of <span class="highlight">United States</span> intelligence agencies then in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for example, to the references to persons sitting opposite wanting to make political capital out of this issue and to one other reference in the statement about people who are opposed to our alliance with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> seeking to exploit the issue for their own purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we read reports from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Coast Guard and speeches by  Senator Edmund  Muskie we see that the general idea to standardise safety equipment and safety techniques is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that an Australian parliamentary committee rather than the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress should be looking at that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again, at their recent summit meeting, the Heads of Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, France, Japan and Italy committed themselves to increasing nuclear energy to help meet the world’s energy requirements while reducing the risks of nuclear proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are issues on which I have already written to  President  Carter and Prime Minister Trudeau and on which the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and Australian officials have held detailed consultations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with the positions taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada Australia would retain the right to cease supply of uranium to any country which breached safeguards undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has proposed an International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program to consider various nuclear fuel cycles in terms of their implications for proliferation control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I noted at the outset, I have already initiated an exchange of correspondence with the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Prime Minister of Canada expressing this wish, and extremely valuable consultations have already taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy I am now announcing incorporates the Government’s consideration of these consultations and represents a very similar approach to safeguards to that adopted by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think one has to look only at the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Great Britain or western Europe to see how quickly results are able to be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This ranges from sophisticated systems like that in West Germany, to a developing system like that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, or the more elementary system that is just beginning to be evolved in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> this system is just starting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People are able to go into the election commission office in Washington- I went there myself- and for 10c a copy get a list of all the donations being made to any of the candidates who are running in the primary elections for the Presidency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that people will say that it is only for the presidency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; it is a separate question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one compares the situation which confronts our parliamentarians with, for example, the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, one would say that there is a great need for rethinking our attitudes to parliamentarians, their duties, their obligations and the work loads that they are expected to carry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much emphasis today is given to and the spotlight has been placed upon many of the statements made by  President  Carter of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America about the energy shortage in that country, the heavy dependence of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> upon imported crude oil and the concern at the dependence of that gigantic country whose requirements of overseas crude oil run into many millions of barrels of oil per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but also the world at large is facing a crisis at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24 February 1976 a call was made to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, 9357824- that is the number we had before- for $25.20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Calls were made to Switzerland again on good old 7481820 for $61.20, and to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to 9354262 for $46.80 and $32.40-two telephone calls on the one day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 15 October 1975 and 12 October 1975 calls were made to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to the same number, 3424490, both for $72, both lengthy conversations indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>These phone calls came from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Austria, the United Kingdom, West Germany, New Guinea, Ireland- southern, I think; not northern Ireland-Switzerland and various places in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Indonesian Government or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> oil company Oceanic Exploration made any approach to the Australian Government regarding the right to explore 15 million acres off the south coast of Timor extending to the mid-point of the sea between Timor and Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware of a report in the  Canberra Times  of 21 May that <span class="highlight">United States</span> military aid to Indonesia will be terminated at the end of the current financial year and that this decision was conveyed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador on 18 May? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I inform the Senate that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  will be absent from Australia from later today until 28 June, during which time he will attend the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in London and have discussions in Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources to a recent report that some overseas countries are making heavy investments in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> fishing industry to circumvent the newly introduced 200-mile fisheries conservation zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These countries will share the priority fishing rights with <span class="highlight">United States</span>-owned concerns by operating vessels built in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and flying the American flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This influx of foreign investment has stirred Congress to move next July to investigate the regulation of ownership of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> fishing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, unlike the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America Australia has not declared a 200-mile fishing zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it happens to be that which was given publicity when the Premier partook of an egg breakfast at Sydney University, my understanding is that that patent was taken out many years ago in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perfectly obvious that the raising of this bogy is designed to undermine the anti-communist fight within the Labor movement and the relationship with our major ally, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said last evening, to the extent that there is any <span class="highlight">United States</span> influence within the trade union movement, it tends to be counterproductive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The growth of unionism in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has followed paths quite different from the paths followed by the trade union movement in Australia and the trade union movement in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labour attaches, as anybody knows, at both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Embassy and other embassies are officials of the State Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, for instance, is graduating only thirty people a year and the average for a country such as Australia would be about ten a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have to recognise that in recent years the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate have involved themselves more and more in the control, the auditing of the funding and the day to day activities of intelligence organisations, without involving themselves in what the intelligence organisations are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is up to the Senate or the Parliament, as it has in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, if it wants to go further and examine the activities of the organisation in much more detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Jim Dunn’s visit to Portugal produced some evidence as did the subsequent inquiry by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not expect the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate to investigate this matter because, as has been said by so many people on so many occasions, the responsibilities rest within our own region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say respectfully that a tender should be held up until the firm is given a clean bill of health because  Senator Wright  would know as an advocate of senators having certain watch-dog responsibilities that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is much closer supervision by senators on committees over tenders for government contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I am making today is that if we wish to protect our export marketthe big question these days is whether it will be the European Economic Community, Japan or sending live cattle to northern countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America- we have to take more notice of this desperate situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of recent reports that Gulf Oil of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America will assist an Australian company, Oil Processors Ltd, to establish recycling refineries in Melbourne and Sydney, will the Minister examine this matter to assess whether a regional recycling plant is necessary or whether further measures might be taken so that all waste oil produced in the Australian Capital Territory is made available for reprocessing in Melbourne or Sydney as this would be an important contribution to energy conservation in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of reports which indicate that sales of meat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are running at less than our <span class="highlight">United States</span> quota average due to the poor American prices being paid, can the Minister ascertain what steps will be taken to encourage exporters to fill the total quota? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without broad control powers it would not have been possible for the Australian Meat Board to have fulfilled Australia’s obligations to regulate meat exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America under the voluntary restraint and quota arrangements which have existed at various times since 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently I was looking at a publication which stated that the United Automobile Workers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had something like $90m in its strike fund and was asking for more money because large sums of money would be given to its employees during the prolonged strike that was taking place at the time when the United Automobile Workers came to negotiate with the automobile industry employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a unanimous judgment, after a terrific travail of litigious controversy, the Supreme Court of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> held that the effect of the union boycotting the goods of the employer as against other firms was a restraint of trade that was struck down by the Sherman Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we talk about private enterprise and the special safeguards that are in the minds of some honourable senators, I point out that the concept of business enterprise as it operates in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> economy has always been put forward in this place as one that we should emulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the announcements in the White Paper on Australian Defence in November 1976 (Chapter 4, paras 88 and 91, page 24) Requests for Proposals were forwarded to eleven manufacturers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Europe inviting proposals for the provision of a new tactical fighter aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-77">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The detailed investigations mentioned in the Defence White Paper are proceeding but they have been affected by a number of factors including the late submission of proposals by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> companies, due to a U.S. legislative requirement that such proposals be submitted through the U.S. Department of Defense, and the lack of detailed information provided by some of the prospective suppliers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-77">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the decision about the base made after an approach from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or unilaterally; if the former, when was the formal approach made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and from whom did it come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Government has reacted to a <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America request for the attitude to the retention of the Subic Bay Base, did the Australian Government consult with the Philippines Government prior to giving an answer; if so, what was the nature of the consultation and when did it take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report to which he refers was apparently gleaned from a press conference which the Minister gave in Manila on 16 April 1977 in which he stated, inter alia, that there was a desire on the part of the Australian Government to see a <span class="highlight">United States</span> presence remain in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> troop withdrawals from the Republic of Korea has been the subject of exchanges of views at various levels between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and the Australian Government since the election of  President  Carter in November 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time the aphid is being found in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia but it is expected to spread throughout Australia very rapidly as it did apparently in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because the contribution for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is SUS2.4 billion or more than 30 per cent of the total, this means, in effect, that the fifth replenishment cannot become effective and other countries will not be required to contribute to IDA without formal notification from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the IDA that it has taken all the necessary legislative steps to enable it to participate on the basis of the agreement reached for the fifth replenishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was not able to give the required formal notification by that date, and thereby enable the IDA to maintain the continuity of its lending operations in the interim, other donors have been asked, and have generally agreed, to make voluntary advance contributions on a collective basis totalling not less than SUS1.2 billion to IDA, in anticipation of the conditions of effectiveness for the agreement being fulfilled and to cover lending operations for a substantial part of 1977-78. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time it might be considered to be rather ironic that in the very week in which we are debating this nationally and internationally important issue influential scientists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are pressing for a ban on the use of pressure pack sprays because of their likely effect on or severe damage to the earth ‘s ozone layer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed it appears obvious that since the last visit by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America uranium is to be used as a carrot, waved in front of other nations in order to obtain markets, particularly in the European Economic Community countries and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and there I learnt from reading a publication called the  National Enquirer,  which was published in March this year, that since 1969 there had been 170 threats and acts of violence against atomic plants, causing millions of dollars of damage in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure the Senate that there is great concern in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> about radio-active nuclear waste disposal in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I suggest, gives the Senate some idea of the concern and the controversy that is raging in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on this vexatious and controversial problem of the disposal of radioactive nuclear waste material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fox Committee reported that it was apparent that there was a great deal of scope for reducing the rate of energy consumption required for a given level of economic activity, particularly in countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada which historically have had access to cheap energy and have therefore not been economically motivated to conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, of course, the need for nuclear energy has fallen away-so much so that the nuclear energy industry itself is saying that it is in disarray, that it does not know where it is going and that it would rather get out of the industry before any more problems arise because it cannot handle the problems facing it at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was not aware of these fascinating details of the history of South Dakota, or of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for that matter, until  Senator Mulvihill  was good enough to send me advance notice of the question- perhaps  Senator Georges  ought to take note of that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister Is it not true, as stated by the recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional inquiry on nuclear energy costs, that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> alone over 7 1 million gallons of high level radioactive waste is currently being temporarily stored in two localities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that thousands of tons of other radioactive waste has also accumulated over the last 30 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular question arising out of what was alleged to be in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional report was put to the witnesses by one of the members of the Committee and they said that they would go away, study the report and let the Committee have a considered answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The degree of understatement in 1976 was not high by international standards; for Australia as a whole it was 2.7 per cent, compared with, for example, 2.5 per cent in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> census of 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia, as in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, about 75 per cent of the total transportation energy consumption is consumed by road transport and since 75 per cent or more of the population live in urban areas, conservation effort has been logically addressed in the first instance, to urban highway use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our present peace-time strategy is to support as best we may over a range of policies the continuation of the presently favourable prospects for our national security; to maintain effective defence relations with our friends and allies, especially the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in our neighbouring regions; and to maintain a substantial and efficient force-in-being that demonstrates our military capability to deal with situations that could develop with shorter warning and to expand in time should the need for this arise during the longer term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the Mississippi Valley, an area which is particularly prone to severe storms of this kind, because of the dense population in that area and perhaps because that country has more funds than we have, the meteorological authorities are able to operate a very sophisticated system of weather radars and other ground observation stations supported by photographs from geostationary satellites which they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kennedy and his brother, the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, said that the company’s profits were excessive and they produced before a Senate committee a table which showed that the extra wages for the steel workers and coal miners of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would come to about $1 lm or a little more but the price hike- that is an American term- would mean that Bethlehem Steel would get back $17m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seemed to us and it seems from the information contained in  Mr Hamer  ‘s interjections that in those days our intelligence assessments and our interests were considered to be exactly the same as those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and that we were getting most of our intelligence information on the situation in IndoChina from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was obvious- it seemed obvious to us- that our interests were considered to be coincident with those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that their judgments were automatically our judgments and that their information was automatically our information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would hope, as I said previously, that this is in fact an evolutionary step and that a continuing evaluation will be made of the performance of the new Office and the difficulties that the new Office may get into, and that eventually even a committee of this Parliament will be able to perform what I think is its rightful duty and keep an eye on the efficiency, effectiveness and legality of our intelligence operations, as exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Action was taken ultimately not as a result of the assessment by the National Security Council of whether there was or was not a threat to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, but simply because one of the important elements in the National Security Council ‘s analysis of what was happening in Cuba related to the then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who was not even in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia and Japan are bilaterally totally out of balance, and so are Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With its common agricultural policy, it has been a thorn in the side of many of the efforts that have been made around the world in recent years to reach agreements and to break down the trade barriers which exist and which so many more forwardlooking countries, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, wish to see broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appreciate also the emphasis that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is placing on this area of technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator McLaren  stated that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was spending about $240m this financial year on research and development in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical assessments by experts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America- the National Science Foundation/National Aeronautics Space Administration in 1973, Atomic Energy Commission in 1973, Federal Energy Agency m 1974, NSF in 1974 and the American Petroleum Society in 1975- all broadly agree that a significant fraction of energy supply could be taken up by diverse solar technologies within this century and far more shortly thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Starting in the 1990s, these solar energy estimates considerably exceeded the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Atomic Energy Commission ‘s most sanguine projections for the contributions of nuclear fission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> AEC’s own report-that is, the MASH Report 1535- December 1974- concedes that in 2020 A.D. new non-fission technologies could supply five times as much electricity as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> now uses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article continues:  he also said he doubted the feasibility of Australia taking the lead over such countries as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the development of solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate the point, the solar energy research of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Energy Research and Development Administration alone is of the order of $US100m per annum’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just quoted the figure of $ 100m so far as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should look not just at the research effort of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, as great as it is and commendable as it is, but also at the taxation attitudes of state governments and the Congress in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to simple tax concessions in that sphere, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is involved in great many areas of support of solar energy on a wider basis than probably has been mentioned in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I make a plea for the Government to be far ranging in its attitudes and to introduce tax concessions for solar energy installations and, further, for the saving of energy in general, as does the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to  Senator Keeffe  ‘s point about the expenditure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on solar energy research, I point out that in the current year 1976-77, although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is spending about $180m on solar energy research it is spending $ 1,401m on nuclear research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 8 September 1977  (Hansard  page 704)  Senator Brown  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for National Resources, a question without notice as to whether there is any substance in an allegation that there is a proposal that Australia enter into an agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada for the purpose of dumping the western world’s nuclear wastes in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the experience of the period of prohibition in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> between 1 92 1 and 1 933 showed clearly that if there is public demand for a drug, and if there is acceptance amongst a substantial group of citizens that it is acceptable to use that drug, any penal provisions are bound to end in failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amongst the allegations that were levelled against Smith was the allegation that Smith, as a Catholic, was the sort of person who would favour the occasional drink and who would open the floodgates to alcohol in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former <span class="highlight">United States</span> Attorney, whose name was Kaplan, made a similar point with regard to the prohibition of marihuana in the 1960s, that is, that it was a campaign mainly by older, more settled and conservative people against a lifestyle, again to a certain extent that of ethnic minorities, particularly among the socalled Chicanoes- the immigrants from Mexico and other Latin countries, who have taken marihuana traditionally as part of their culture in the same way as people in other parts of the world were smoking tobacco- and also against the young people who had taken up marihuana in the 1950s and 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Attorney made was that the damage which was caused to the health was, if it were a motivation, not the primary motivation of those who favoured prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s, in the same way as the question of whether marihuana is damaging to the health was not a primary motivation in the 1960s and 1970s among a number of those people who were in favour of heavy penalties or penalties for the use of marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which in many ways has been the pathfinder, both in the use of marihuana and the banning of marihuana and in turn in the relaxation of the laws with regard to marihuana, in a great many States already there has been considerable relaxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whether South Dakota has just come back again or not, the fact remains that over the last 10 years there has been a tendency in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> towards a relaxation of the laws relating to marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if she compared the laws in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> now with those of 10 years ago in relation to the use of marihuana she would find them considerably more liberal now than they were 10 years ago, whatever may be the position in South Dakota, on which I am afraid I am not presently well advised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an oversimplification of the situation to say that, simply because the legalisation of alcohol in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> got rid of the bootlegging problem and all that went with it, we ought to do the same thing in Australia with marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the matters I have mentioned, the major difference between ourselves and the view of the majority on the national strategy is that we disagree with the inferences drawn by the majority from recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first objection is that we do not think it follows as a matter of course that what is good for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is good for Australia, whether in regard to lowering penalties and lessening the gravity of offences in relation to marihuana or the other wider and different fields of human experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any case, it indicates that people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are having second thoughts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include the New York Mayor’s Committee report in 1942, the Wootton Report in the United Kingdom, the Le Dain Report in Canada, the Shafer Report in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and various other studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of the trials and ordeals that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has gone through in this respect, and there it has been thought desirable to broaden the consultation to the majority and minority leaders in both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had a cost disability with the rest of the world that moved from a surplus in our favour with our principal trading partners, such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to a deficiency against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I conclude by referring to some comments made in an address given in Sydney on Monday by Professor Gramm of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some States of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in particular, have departed from that practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may know that the previous Liberal-Country Party Government- that is, the one in office before 1 972- received overtures from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America about the building in this country of an Omega station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was despite the fact that even immediately after the <span class="highlight">United States</span> denial the representative of the intelligence service of the military general staff repeated the conclusion that Omega was linked to missile-carrying submarines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Omega case was being considered in Norway in 1971 there was not a single representative in the Norwegian Parliament who asked any question or made any criticism, even though it was evident to them surely that the installation was to be financed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Schei report shows clearly that neither of these military systems were being proposed through NATO but were the subject of purely bilateral arrangements between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Norway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This potential is significant and every assistance should be given to ensure that Australian producers are technically competitive with their counterparts in Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One should look at the figures for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which has backed off from the principle of one vote one value, and for Great Britain and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may relate to my opening remarks, when I drew an analogy with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> senator from Missouri and how he saved LBJ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> requires an Observatory in this location to complete a global network of such Observatories established in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and other countries to allow continuous solar observations on a 24 hour per day basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the agreement, the Australian Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force are the designated cooperating agencies of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government respectively, and the Observatory will be operated under the joint management of the cooperating agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be manned by officers of the Air Weather Service of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force, civilian personnel from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Oceanographic and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major costs of the Observatory will be met by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government for the duration of the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government welcomes the establishment of the new Observatory and looks forward to close cooperation with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on this project which will provide improved data on solar activity for the benefit of radio communicators and the scientific community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the policy of the Senate is stated quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and it is the situation in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here we have this nice little in-club arrangement whereby Ministers in the Fraser Government notify  Mr Fraser  himself whether they have any pecuniary interests which might be in conflict with the sorts of principles which have been enunciated by parliaments in Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough when one compares it with the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which has a presidential election system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at the last presidential election there was public funding for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in time this aspect will spread to all the Congressional and Senate elections which are held in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very few people are aware that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, France, and other democratic countries Estimates are subject to very close scrutiny before they are passed and are liable to be drastically amended against the wishes of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: In view of the distinct hardening of attitude of the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Jimmy Carter, and his Government to all forms of whaling, including the impounding of an Australian cargo of that source, does the Minister not feel that, in the light of the attitudes of his party and my own, it would be wise to cut our losses and convert the Albany whaling station into a marine research station rather than affect relations with out large and powerful ally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that the honourable senator, almost alone among his colleagues, is a follower of the policies of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amazes me that the Minister wrote to this Society on 13 December 1976 at which time he had all the records from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we leave it in the ground we have done nothing about the dangers, the disposal of nuclear waste, about terrorists acquiring weapons, nothing about people occupied in the generating plants in West Germany, Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America it is possible for a voter to vote by making cross marks to indicate that he is voting in accordance with a party ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I might add that I doubt the feasibility of Australia taking the lead over countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the development of solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate the point, the solar energy research expenditure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Energy Research and Development Administration alone is of the order of $US100m per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the two facts that  Mr Justice  Fox has reported, namely, that there is general opposition overseas to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian propositions that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by those countries without the specific approval of supplier countries and that there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer nuclear safeguards satisfactorily, how does the Australian Government intend to maintain the fictional assurances given to the Australian people that Australian safeguards will be met completely by overseas takers of our uranium exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I thought that the honourable senator would welcome the views of both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian governments on uranium reprocessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Internationally there was recognition that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian nuclear policies had drawn attention to the particular dangers associated with re-processing and breeder reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia will in no circumstances enter into any arrangements with any other country that is not prepared to abide by our safeguards, not necessarily the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or Canadian safeguards, but Australia’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that a recent report from Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd stated that the demand for uranium will depend on the rate of growth in nuclear power generating capacity and advances in nuclear technology; that m the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America there have been only four orders for new nuclear plants in 1 977, two for tentative preliminary contracts only; and that Howard Winterson, Vice-President of Combustion Engineering in America has said recently: ‘In about two years you will see this business disintegrate’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similar agreements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Energy Research and Development Administration and with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Bureau of Mines, which have recently been subsumed with the new <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Energy, are at an advanced stage of negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Sir John  Latham took up his duties and when  Mr Justice  Dixon went to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America this country was in the darkest throes of one of the greatest struggles in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I confirm that I am now in a position to answer that part of  Senator Lajovic  ‘s question which he asked yesterday concerning the attitude of the Australian Government to the International Labour Organisation following the announcement by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of its intended withdrawal from the ILO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia understands the reasons for the decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and notes that initial moves in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for withdrawal originated with employer and union associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister write to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of State,  Mr Cyrus  Vance, suggesting that considerable uneasiness exists in the South East Asian region, particularly in the ASEAN countries, regarding future <span class="highlight">United States</span> foreign policy towards the area; if so, can the Minister inform the Senate of the contents of the letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The Foreign Minister wrote to the U.S. Secretary of State,  Mr Cyrus  Vance, on 31 August about <span class="highlight">United States</span> policies in South East Asia, in response to a request by  Mr Vance  for an elaboration of views expressed to him during the visit to Washington of the Prime Minister and the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the letter was a personal and confidential communication it would not be appropriate to divulge its contents, beyond noting that it underlined again the well known view of this Government that a continuing positive role by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in South East Asia is important for the region’s peaceful development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How will the Australian Government ensure that Aus.tralian safeguards will be completely met by overseas takers of our uranium exports, in view of  Mr Justice  Fox’s report of 29 September 1977, recorded in a Foreign Affairs Departmental minute made public on 2 November 1977, that: (a) there is general opposition overseas to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian proposition that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by these countries without the specific approval of supplier countries; and (b) there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer safeguards satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators,  I  present an exchange of notes between the Australian Government and the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, constituting an agreement regarding the management and operation of the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station, at Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have concluded a new agreement which provides for the Station to be operated in a completely open way and under joint United Sates and Australian management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new agreement the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Air Force will be the co-operating agencies for the management and operation of the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> will continue to man the Station for its basic nuclear non-proliferation monitoring purpose, and Australia will provide the effort required to adapt the results to research in earth sciences, as well as participating in overall management and providing services for the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About three weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting  Senator Scott,  the retiring leader of the Republican Party in the Senate of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Scott of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, who is a very blue-veined Republican and who would be the last to want to upset US security, said to me:  Senator, after  what we have gone through it would have been much better if, whenever a senior security officer abused his trust, we were to nip his actions in the bud’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only this morning we heard from  Mr Schultze  the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Economic Advisory Council, which is a senior body that advises the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Schultze  reflects the type of policy which is now gaining greater strength in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America as that country sees that governments must take the initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite honourable senators to look at the GovernorGeneral’s Speech where they will find a few bromides and a few platitudes about Australia’s friendly relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and about how the Commonwealth of Nations is going from strength to strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the most important events which has taken place over recent years, however little it may so far have accomplished, has been the statement by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America shortly after his election that in future the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration would not look merely at the national interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in assessing its relations with foreign countries but would also look at the human rights of citizens within foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would look at not only those countries with which in the past it was unfriendly- countries such as the Soviet Union or China- but also countries with which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had had friendly relations, countries such as Argentina and Uraguay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not so long ago, only a decade or two, that the ‘Free World’ was the expression used by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the supporters of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John Foster Dulles, that powerful figure in the formulation of American foreign policy and for so many years Secretary of State in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration, when asked to define what he meant by the ‘free world’ said he meant those countries which were free from Soviet domination and undue Soviet influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once again, as throughout the 1 950s and the 1 960s we find Australia taking a more conservative, reactionary and unproductive position on human values than that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, even in that country’s most conservative era under the Eisenhower Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was its problem during the 1950s and the 1960s when Australia followed in the wake of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America; when we had a Prime Minister who said that his motto was ‘All the way with LBJ’; when we had governments which did not step out of line with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America except on those rare occasions when they could find someone farther to the right than the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the only time they disagreed with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, then the <span class="highlight">United States</span> took a sensible position on the withdrawal of Anglo-French forces and Australia took a position which seemed to suggest that Eisenhower was an undercover communist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that occasion when they disagreed with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> from the right they did not vary from the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in any significant way whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a mixture of reasons, including, I think it is fair to say, the genuine humanitarian convictions of people such as  Mr Young,  the present <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador to the United Nations and probably  Mr Carter  and  Mr Mondale,  the <span class="highlight">United States</span> feels sympathy for the various national liberation movements in Africa- a sympathy which I do not doubt is accentuated by the fact that those people know that there is a 20 per cent non-white electorate inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which would also have some views on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has now taken a position in which it is certainly in opposition to if not in confrontation with the present regimes in Rhodesia or Zimbabwe and the Republic of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other meetings are taking place at which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Britain appear to be taking the leading role as the foreign powers- this is not an occasion when the Soviet Union, China, Cuba or other forces are involved- that are pressing for the so-called external settlement with the Patriotic Front in Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countries such as Australia which are geographically closer than the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and which have a historical association with many of the white South Africans and the white Rhodesians ought to be playing a part in the settlement of these disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I am not fully aware of the scheme that the honourable senator suggests may be used in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, there certainly has been discussion in this country on whether encouragement should be given by way of assistance with the capital cost of installing solar heating and cooling systems for domestic use and whether there could be greater industrial usage of some solar heating and cooling systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very difficult in Australia, more difficult than it is in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom where studies have been done, to find out why people vote in a particular way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has therefore well arrived when the monopoly control of Australian media has to be looked at very seriously, as has been happening in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-No, but there should be a diversity of ownership of media interests throughout Australia, as is occurring in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there are some 66 newspaper-television station cross-ownerships, in this nation a mere five or six own and control the whole of the media operations of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our hopes for the future lie in the scientific exploration of the resources in that area, as I think I pointed out in the early part of my speech, and consideration must be given to upgrading our communications systems so that we can match other countries which currently, as is the case with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Soviet Union, do not recognise our claims to sovereignty over the areas in the Antarctic which we believe are our possessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and I discussed with people at the Library of Congress in its Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped the network of services throughout the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a comprehensive service and takes in more than 100 libraries throughout the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Library in Canada and the Library of Congress in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> concentrate their efforts on the blind and physically handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Libraries in countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, are compiling union catalogues and registers of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are already similar institutes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in the Caribbean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> aged persons make an enormous contribution through voluntary programs or through ‘voluntarism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has a federal agency for voluntary services which is known as Action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These voluntary programs for aged persons in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> provide the dignity and satisfaction of making a continuing contribution to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have territory there with New Zealand, the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and there are real questions as to who has the right to that territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the pact that we have with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and New Zealand which is known as ANZUS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, our relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is seen as being based on a security-style military pact which was signed and ratified in the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that our relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> be seen in the context of the more than 100 agreements, conventions and exchanges of letters- we had an example of the latter presented in this chamber today- which form the relationship between us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a much broader and more mature relationship than that, and I hope that some measures might be taken to ensure that all of us, the Australian community generally would perceive our relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in that broader context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a treaty of friendship and co-operation with Japan, and perhaps we ought to be looking toward a treaty such as that with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, while maintaining the ANZUS Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that his colleague has called for a new <span class="highlight">United States</span> initiative to do more than make what he called ‘adjustments to the margins’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that entry to Australia has been refused to a  Mr Fred  Mazelis, a <span class="highlight">United States</span> citizen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> prohibits recruitment of any persons as mercenaries within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but does not prohibit a citizen or other person in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> leaving the country to enlist in a foreign military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Export licences for the profitable <span class="highlight">United States</span> market are granted on the basis of credits earned from exporting to other markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a considerable amount of favouritism is being exercised by the Minister for Primary Industry in the granting of <span class="highlight">United States</span> export licences and export orders to companies which have not earned sufficient credits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I cite the granting of an <span class="highlight">United States</span> export contract to a  Mr Whitaker  of Wales Meats, to operate out of an Alice Springs abattoir, just recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, was  Mr Sinclair  in any way responsible for the granting to Norwest an extra quota worth $1.5m, for export to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has now designated Continental Airlines as a second US carrier on the South Pacific, despite the earlier disastrous losses of $25m by American Airlines and those of other carriers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister received a report following inquiries that I understand have been made into the disastrous grain silo explosions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in December last where many people lost their lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my understanding that <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government authorities have not made an official report on the explosions to which the honourable senator referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not expect it is widely realised that the explosions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, which were so widely publicised at the end of last year and in January this year, were by no means the first to occur in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present we are seeing incursions by Cuban and Soviet troops into the internal affairs of various African countries- incursions of such a nature as would, I think, arouse a great deal of uproar if they were to be committed by, for example, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I imagine that in 1939 the Australian Government may have decided that it was quite proper for the French Army or the Polish Army to recruit Australians to serve in their forces, just as the Americans served in the British and French forces in the First World War and in the Second World War until the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America entered the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government took no action against those Americans who volunteered to serve in the British Forces in 1939, 1940 and 1941, and a similar situation could arise in our case where we could say we were giving moral support to some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been assisted by investment from Japan, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In pursuit of the economies of scale, countries like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, West Germany and Japan have carried out a major investment policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst our structural problems may vary, they still have their counterparts in countries such as Japan, West Germany, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom, and the European Economic Community countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a coastal surveillance organisation similar to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Coastguard, whether or not it is under the aegis of the armed forces, its funding should come from sources other than the defence appropriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could that Australian coastguard be modelled on the highly efficient and professional <span class="highlight">United States</span> coastguard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without delaying the Senate, I should like to have incorporated in  Hansard  two short pages comprising an extract from a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate committee hearing of 1977, which details the functions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> coastguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FUNCTIONS OF <span class="highlight">UNITED STATES</span> COASTGUARD <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Coast Guard employs multipurpose vessels, aircraft, and shore units, strategically located along the coasts and inland waterways of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in selected areas overseas to carry out its duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Coast Guard operating facilities have the capacity for promoting safety on or over the high seas and on waters subject to the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Loran stations are operated in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and abroad to serve the needs of the armed services and marine and air commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Administrative control is exercised over the construction, maintenance, and operation of bridges across the navigable waters of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to insure that the safe passage of navigation is not unreasonably interfered with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian coastguards have assumed a particular organisational role? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One suspects that it was only because of the peculiar processes of <span class="highlight">United States</span> democracy that there began to be very serious concern in most democratic communities about these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only as a result of developments in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in 1975 that the suspicions of many people, who 10 or 15 years ago might have been regarded as being a bit paranoid about the whole question, were very largely confirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I illustrate what I mean about the suspicions of people by referring to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> agency journal  Almanac  1975 dealing with national security in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government probe of intelligence agency activities, and the summary of the revelations, as the article is called, is in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another organisation concerned with internal security within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as distinct from the Central Intelligence Agency, which by its own charter is precluded from the sort of internal actions in which it took part and which were summarised in the passage I read, the article states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, those sorts of activities have been revealed by the peculiar processes of <span class="highlight">United States</span> democracy which we all sometimes criticise but which I believe on occasions we have reason to envy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course such people were also regarded as peculiar people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress has revealed that they were not peculiar people at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to the sorts of principles which have been enunciated in Britain and I have referred to the inquiries which have been conducted by the Congress in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in relation to this sort of confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the inquiries conducted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>,  President  Carter has sought to establish a much more responsible overview of the activities of intelligence services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition he has established in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> what is called the Congressional Intelligence Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That information is taken from a document entitled ‘Administration of Jimmy Carter 1978’ which was obtained from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Information Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is the development of a system which seems much more responsive to Congress and the executive arm of government than the confused system that we have here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, compared with the suggestions in the Denning report and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress report, the Hope report strikes me as being extremely vague on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an extraordinarily vague and unsatisfactory provision compared with the quite clear statements which Lord Denning was prepared to enunciate in England and which  President  Carter’s committee seems to have been prepared to enunciate in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have cause to be concerned about the revelations in this country in the last couple of months which are totally consistent with the revelations in countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America over a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Carter has initiated the international fuel cycle evaluation to study the non-proliferation aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for the time being has suspended the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an article appearing in the  Sunday Mail  in Queensland on 12 March which described how a 200 series Boeing 727, on a domestic flight from Miami to Newark in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, sequentially suffered complete power loss on all three engines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information indicated that no cause for the occurrence had been established and that further investigation was being pursued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Transportation Safety Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government, through its coal research agreement with the United Kingdom and others under negotiation with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, will be able to assist Australian research workers to be fully informed of the latest overseas developments in coal conversion and so ensure that Australia will be able to take full advantage of the developments in technology in this very important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed is a national water quality reference document of the kind published by the Environmental Protection Agency in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in the publication entitled Quality Criteria for Water’, which is quite a large document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has adopted very stringent rules and laws with respect to water quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About onethird of it is desert; more than half of it receives an average annual rainfall of less than 15 inches; and the average annual rainfall on the mainland is 16.5 inches, compared with 26 inches for all land areas in the world and 29 inches for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have also been heartened by my recent discussions with Ambassador Strauss in Washington, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Special Trade Representative, who confirmed to me the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government’s intention to strongly press in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations in Geneva for improved market access into the EEC for agricultural products, including, most importantly, beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister approve of this, bearing in mind that Australia is not yet an American State and in any case it has social, educational and cultural issues and needs different from those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particularly in the case of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union, and to a somewhat lesser extent other countries, summer teams of between 850 and 1,000 are engaged, and these numbers are substantially reduced when climatic conditions between March and October make operations hazardous, costly and minimally effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that a very high level group from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is in Australia at present discussing the development, perhaps on a joint basis with Australia, of features of this system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is that not sufficient ground for the Minister to deny reports that the present deputation from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is here virtually to tell us how InterScan will be developed and that Australian industry might receive 10 per cent of the total production of the InterScan system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister has had so much to say about InterScan in the past 12 months, can he now say on behalf of the Government that what has been developed in this country will receive proper recognition and that the Australian Government will stand by it irrespective of the pressures from <span class="highlight">United States</span> companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that for some time it has been a joint development by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, as I understand it, more than 50 per cent of the whole of the installations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will be of this type of system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be very foolish for this country to believe that it would be able to deliver its system to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in that volume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What inquiries have been made by the Minister’s Department, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation or the Commonwealth health authorities to ascertain, firstly, whether the herbicides are contaminated with the highly toxic chemical known as ‘Dioxin’ and what systematic checking is done to ensure that this contaminant is kept below dangerous levels; secondly, the extent of available overseas investigation and reports and in particular the evidence which caused <span class="highlight">United States</span> District Judge Otto Skopil on 7 March 1977, to grant an injunction against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Forest Service restraining the use of phenoxy herbicides, including 2, 4, 5-T, in the Siuslaw National Forest and whether such ban of its use has since been extended to all 19 forests in the States of Oregon and Washington; and thirdly, whether the authorities are aware of the claims by Kevin Twigg a Kyabram dairy farmer, of illnesses suffered by him through the Victorian Lands Department’s use of such herbicides on his property in Victoria in 1976? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> does not participate in the agreement, it provides even less security for the Australian industry than we previously thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Agreement establishes a price range of 1 1 to 2 1 <span class="highlight">United States</span> cents per pound- equivalent to SA2I7 to $A414 per tonne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once again the significant point is that the  Deputy  Prime Minister misrepresented this Agreement as being something which established a price range between 1 1 and 2 1 <span class="highlight">United States</span> cents per pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We fell for this in the early 1960s after the conflict between Cuba and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had disrupted the world sugar market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government of Queensland ought to have made a more astute assessment of the likely potential market for sugar at that time, given that the cycle of high prices caused by either crop failure or some other market disruption like the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-Cuba dispute of the early 1 960s induces boom prices, which in turn induce an expansion of acreage planted in most of the major sugar-producing countries and, consequently, another depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement also tries to stabilise sugar prices within a range of 1 1 <span class="highlight">United States</span> cents and 2 1 <span class="highlight">United States</span> cents per pound, financed by a levy on all trade in sugar by members of the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a major accomplishment to get the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to become a party to the agreement in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third marketing arrangement which affected Australia’s sugar industry and which we might consider was the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Sugar Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious from the Acting Minister’s News Release that negotiations between the Australian Government and the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on this matter are incomplete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-46-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the importance of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> beef market to Australia, will the Minister check on the accuracy of this article? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take it that so far the legislation has passed only the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no indication as to whether it has also passed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, even if it has passed the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate, it may still have two hurdles to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who want to get into an argument about the ‘wicked multinationals’ should read through the newspapers and Congress reports from America for the early twentieth century, when American dialogue was continuously to the effect that it was quite clear that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was being taken over by British and European capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He then goes on to say that when he made further inquiries he was informed that the pictures of the flames were in fact pictures of the flames from a flare stack at a coke works in Sheffield, miles away, and that the pictures of the radiation victim had been taken from a medical journal and represented the victim of an accident in connection with the weapons industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we leave it in the ground, we have done nothing about the dangers, the disposal of nuclear waste, about terrorists acquiring weapons, nothing about people occupied in the generating plants in West Germany, Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Examples of the use of uranium in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have shown the impossibility of being certain that waste resulting from the treatment of uranium can be disposed of safely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But the vast quantity of accumulated waste that already exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is such that it would challenge the ability of scientists more than ever to find the proper technique by which to dispose of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is enough radioactive waste now, enough plutonium in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and other countries to produce hundreds of nuclear bombs or if they are exposed to the atmosphere to destroy hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people, so that that’s the criteria by which we judge whether there should have been radioactive waste disposal solved before the nuclear power plants were on line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is being conducted on several levels and I think it is of great importance to the future of food production in this country, lt is considered generally within the public area to be something of a health risk because of legal action on the matter which has been taken in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With those sorts of costs coming up, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has a real problem with the disposal of waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to us that s. 4 1 is a special power which was enacted at a time when the need to secure Australian uranium for use by Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in nuclear weapons was uppermost in the minds of those concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We approached the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to join with us in this project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without the influence of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, probably a scheme such as the one Australia has been able to put forward would not have got ofl” the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had not been for that work would the Minister not agree that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Russia or any other nation today would not have any chance of benefiting from such an innovative scheme as  InterScan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Productivity, give the Parliament a detailed statement of the negotiations which took place here over the past two or three weeks when a <span class="highlight">United States</span> delegation came here to negotiate certain arrangements for the development of  InterScan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Knight  asked a direct question whether my attention had been drawn to an article which used words suggesting that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America system had been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wriedt  asked me the most important question of whether I would be prepared to bring before the Parliament a statement relating to the negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ company in relation to the development of the equipment that may be used in InterScan installations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister says that that is not on, I commend to him the comments I made during the second reading debate on this legislation, when I mentioned the role which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate played when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army reclamation engineers ran unchecked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is now growing evidence in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, as told to the Congressional inquiry in February last, that those who have been in contact with uranium, for instance in mining, in reactor operation, and in the maintenance of nuclear reactors for submarine propulsion, may develop  leukemias  and other forms of cancer, 20-30 years after initial exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fry spent quite a long period of time in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where he worked in the radiological department of a prominent hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless I am mistaken and unless the amendments to which  Senator Jessop  referred are specific, as a conservationist I cannot see that our national parks will be as well protected as those in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an article dealing with the current <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress debate on the cutting up of Alaska. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to prove that in the debates between the developmentalists and the conservationists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the real argument has been whether certain areas in Alaska will be defined as wilderness areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of State went on record as saying that at present the <span class="highlight">United States</span> appears to be deficient in petroleum and natural gas resources but the last place in which exploration would occur would be these wilderness areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I shall await with interest the reply by the Minister for Education to see whether he will be able to give me an iron clad assurance that if the Government has its way with the three mining enclaves it will not in either phase 1 or phase 2 of the project mine in areas which will destroy the concept of a national park but that it will be influenced to emulate the feelings which prevail in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never heard either the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  or the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann)  echo the sentiments of the present <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of the Interior, who has said that, whatever America’s fuel demands might be, wildlife refuges will not be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the Kennedy era, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had a problem about the rights of negroes to enter universities in the southern states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Attorney-General Kennedy had not put the federal marshals into Alabama, they would never have moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army reclamation engineers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some queer happenings occurred in Florida with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Army reclamation people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In seconding with the strongest force at my command, the amendment moved by  Senator Ryan,  I say that I believe that there are not enough safeguards to make the park what it should be and that would emulate the philosophy that seems to premeate the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that I agree with what  Senator Carrick  said at the commencement of his second reading speech concerning the vision splendid for Kakadu National Park, but I remain unconvinced that there are safeguards for this or any other national park in comparison with what appears to operate in regard to the wilderness concept in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is as easy as his authority makes out and if there is as little danger as his authority would have us believe, why is it that in Washington a congressional study has raised once again some old questions about the future of nuclear energy, at least in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Congressional report charges that no permanent acceptable storage method has yet been found for radioactive waste and that this disposal problem, more than any other factor, threatens the future of nuclear energy in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that the properties of these chemicals have been most extensively examined by the World Health Organisation and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and recently in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among these are the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, New Zealand, Canada and the European Economic Community countries- in short both major fishing nations and nations with fisheries resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen details of an interview given to the New York  Times  by  Mr Brzezinski,  who is the <span class="highlight">United States</span> national security adviser, in which he stated that he had given an unprecedented briefing to Chinese officials on the status of the Soviet-American strategic arms talks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether the Australian Government has been kept similarly informed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and whether it is satisfied with the amount of confidential information it is receiving from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in respect of the talks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development been drawn to reports of the findings of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional committee last week, which are set out in a document entitled  Nuclear Power Costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that substantial advances have been made in brucellosis eradication in Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and New Zealand and that advances have been made in eradicating this disease in Australia over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is most likely that our export trade in beef and dairy products will be affected if Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or New Zealand achieve total eradication of brucellosis before Australia does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that our export trade in these products will be most affected if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America eradicates the disease before we do; that is, if it is more successful than we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is illustrated by the current requirement by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> armed forces for brucellosisfree certification of dairy products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me go back in history to the time when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> bought Alaska from Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the old system Mount Lyell was one of the most expensive copper mines in the world but now, with what the company has already achieved, the costs of mining are lower than the average for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask  Senator Withers,  the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whether he is now in a position to answer a question that I asked yesterday concerning discussions between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Chinese governments concerning the strategic arms limitation talks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Yesterday Senator Wriedt asked: First, whether I had seen a  New York Times  report of a briefing of Chinese officials on SALT by <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Security Advisor,  Mr Brzezinski;  secondly, whether the Australian Government has been kept similarly informed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; and thirdly, whether the Australian Government is satisfied with the amount of confidential information it receives from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on SALT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government maintains a close and regular contact with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government on the whole range of arms control questions and current arms control negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes adequate and timely briefings on strategic arms limitation talks between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Government is entirely satisfied with the confidential briefings it receives from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on SALT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latest round of talks currently being held in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the two countries are trying to resolve the few remaining issues in the SALT II agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>SALT is central to the achievement of stability in the nuclear balance and the relaxation of tensions between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia and Japan both have important relationships with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the two most important economically advanced countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia and Japan are the two most important allies of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both countries have a high stake in the security and prosperity of other economically advanced democratic powers in the world; in the continuation of the process of detente between the super-powers; in maintaining an open and nondiscriminatory regime in international trade; in encouraging a continuing <span class="highlight">United States</span> presence in the Asia/Pacific region to the extent necessary to maintain a sound balance of power there; in opposing any attempt by the Soviet Union- or any other major power- to establish hegemony in the Asia/Pacific region; and in encouraging China to continue to play a constructive role in regional affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommends and the Government agrees, that Australia should support the evolution of a visibly independent Japanese foreign policy which is broadly compatible with that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also know that fairly recently citizen band radio hit the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even after events such as these nations have been involved often in bloodcurdling civil wars- for example, Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is ‘Thou shalt integrate’; the policy of the Government of South Africa is ‘Thou shalt segregate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was used against the Indians in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada, the Maoris in New Zealand, and the Aborigines in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that context, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> scalping was not an Indian pastime; it was white man’s pastime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canadian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> Indians cannot look forward to a long and prosperous life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article shows that these Crows do not regard themselves as American citizens but as another people with another government within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously these historical events are not the responsibility of those whites who today occupy Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, New Zealand and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> another racial problem is posed by the negroes who were first taken there as slaves following another well known pattern of inter-racial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government has mobilised mammoth organisations, released mass propaganda and enacted legislation in favour of the negroes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only the black man fits the world pattern of international political warfare directed against the West by the East, ls it any wonder that the countries most clamant against racial discrimination are those who practise it most, that is Great Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> racial hatred is welling up in negroes who are the victims of this misguided policy of integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a translation can end only in tragedy for the blacks, as seen in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no majority to believe that the minority is holding up its progress as is now the case in regard to schooling in Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where the blacks now are resented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their only genuine intention is to use us for their own ends, as the reds and other left-wingers have operated in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the countries I have mentioned so far in this discussion on inter-racial relations- Britain, Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia and New Zealand- mention must be made of the Portuguese and their efforts in the East Indies, Mozambique and Angola. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one reason or another, the Portuguese stood steadfastly against segregation and for integration, as steadfastly as do the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Britain and other countries now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Integration cannot work, as shown by the experiences of Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Spain in the Americas, and Portugal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister reached any agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America about the conduct of any aspect of the negotiations at the Multilateral Trade Negotiations; if so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the April visit, the Minister met with Ministerial level representatives from a number of participating countries including Ambassador Strauss, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Special Trade Representative,  Mr Nobuhiko  Ushiba, Minister for External Economic Affairs in the Japanese Government, and  Mr Haferkamp,  Vice  President  and Commissioner for External Relations in the European Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was able on both occasions to review the respective stances of the two Governments in relation to the MTN and to confirm and build upon the understanding reached with Ambassador Wolff, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  Deputy  Special Trade Representative, when he visited Australia earlier in the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry will recall my question to him on 24 May in regard to hedging by the Australian Wheat Board on the Chicago grain futures market and his reply to me on 26 May to the effect that the Board has the facility to hedge individual contracts in the futures market in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and that the facility was provided in conformity with the exchange controls exercised by the Reserve Bank of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third marketing arrangement affecting Australia’s sugar industry was the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Sugar Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under that Act Australia was allotted a percentage share of <span class="highlight">United States</span> foreign sugar requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> agreement also terminated at the end of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It goes on to say that without the contributions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the International Sugar Organisation will have great difficulty in getting the fund off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact of the matter is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has until the end of June to ratify the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Antitrust enforcement action that has in recent years been taken in other countries, notably the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, has made it clear that Australian producers could jeopardise their positions under the anti-trust laws of other countries by resorting to restrictive trade practices in their marketing operations with overseas buyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has consistently held the view that a necessary condition if the status of the SDR as a reserve asset is to be enhanced is an increase in the yield accruing to holders vis-a-vis the yield on established reserve assets such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and many other countries bring in their budgets in April, well before the end of the financial year, so the parliaments in those countries examine the expenditure well before the money is to be spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this situation goes on and on and there turns out to be some sort of scandal within ASIO concerning the Government, there will be a situation similar to the situation that has occurred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday from far distant New York the Australian Prime Minister announced to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and to the American people that so far as he, as the political leader of Australia, was concerned Australia and Australians were in for tougher times in fighting the battle of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Primary Industry has given me the following information: The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government has reached a decision to permit substantial quantities of additional beef to enter the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market in order to stem the rising beef prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will announce the actual figure shortly; therefore I do not wish to say any more at this moment about the details. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional quantity to be permitted to enter the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America should be equivalent to the opening of a new major market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to an answer given by the Minister for Primary Industry in the House of Representatives on 22 February in which he drew attention to the need for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to relax meat import restrictions to meet Australian Government representations to that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister will know that on 20 March this year the Minister for Primary Industry stated that a beef export entitlement for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market could be- 1 use his words- worth as much as 31.5c per lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 31.5c per lb is obviously the difference between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> price and the lowest alternative export market price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this therefore mean that the maximum income gain to Australian cattle producers from a higher <span class="highlight">United States</span> quota- if all the gain were passed on to the cattle producers- will be 70c a kilo or $7m for each 10,000 tonne increase in the quota? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government holds the view that, when people in other competing markets realise the interest of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in taking extra volumes of meat, it necessarily follows that they will be alerted and interested in bidding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will its failure to ratify the agreement mean that the levy to establish the Sugar Stock Holding Fund cannot be collected from <span class="highlight">United States</span> importers and that Australian sugar cane growers and producers could have to pay the entire cost of holding the 400,000 tonnes of raw sugar which Australia is committed to hold under the International Sugar Agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, for the reasons I have already mentioned and having regard for the determination expressed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that a significant liberalisa’tion of agricultural trade should be achieved in the MTN, it is clear that the Aus.tralian stance must be predicated on an assumption that the negotiations will bring benefits to all participants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of the developed countries participating in the negotiations including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan and the European Economic Community have already decided to adopt a formula approach to the reduction of tariffs on industrial products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for this balance was expressed in the report on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Freedom of Information Bill by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The currencies of the member countries other than the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were kept stable in terms of dollars and therefore in terms of each other with the aid of official buying and selling of dollars by the central banks concerned in order to prevent an appreciation or depreciation of the respective currencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> continues to follow the policy, which does not seem to have varied regardless of the  President  in power, of benign neglect with regard to its balance of payments after a very aggressive policy it had adopted in August of 1971 of attempting to realign exchange rates by devaluation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are two schools of thought about the continuing position of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar as a major currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that assuming the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is able to keep inflation at relatively low rates, the pure dollar standard could work reasonably well without imposing hardships on other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the OPEC countries decided to move quickly into another currency as their major unit of reserve, the dollar would continue to slide further and the stage might well be reached where 150 yen equals one <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar- a psychological barrier which would not have been contemplated two or three years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar continues to slide there will be every incentive for the OPEC countries to change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will also mean that further increases in imported crude oil prices are possible as the present relationship of the Australian dollar to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar would drag down the dollar and make our imports dearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this context, the declining value of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar is a direct consequence of the view of foreign exchange markets that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the rate of inflation is once again increasing and that the balance of payments deficit is too large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion may 1 simply say that 1 note that on 9 March  President  Carter told  President  Tito, in Washington, that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ‘continued support of the independence, territorial integrity and unity of Yugoslavia’ and also that he indicated that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would ‘take firm measures to prevent and prosecute criminal terrorist activities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that not only was splendid protection provided for those who were fortunate enough to be insured with VIP Insurances but also that no one had anything to worry about, it being such a safe and secure company because it was re-insured with one of the biggest reinsurance companies in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much research has been undertaken into emission control standards in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, where it is claimed that by 1 977 the controls had brought about a 75 per cent reduction in emissions of carbon monoxide and a 50 per cent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The interdepartmental committee which looked into this matter was told to use the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Freedom of Information Act as the basis for its proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the provision of freedom of information legislation has been seen as a solution to some of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view there was no hope of this Government introducing legislation for freedom of information which would have any significant teeth and which would go anywhere near as far as did the legislation in that unusual and, in a way, great democracy, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where legislation of this kind was first brought into existence after the Scandinavian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of some interest to note that when so many of the States of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America introduced citizen initiative about the turn of the century it was regarded then as a radical solution to the problem of a decline in faith in representative democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Treasurer really means what he says, I must assume that he does not understand the implications for Australia flowing from such things as the rapid and serious decline in the value of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The re-appearance of inflationary pressures in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the weakening of that country’s balance of payments is more likely to mean that world trade will contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Importantly for Australia, the rise of the value of the yen relative to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar means that Japanese exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have been declining rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is fruitless to argue that as the Australian dollar moves down in sympathy with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar, the Japanese will hold larger stocks of Australian materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But this issue really overrides the major point and it is one which  Senator Wriedt  completely overrode, namely, that tied to the question of whether there will be increased volume of materials, resources and goods from this country sold to Japan, to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or to other countries is the fact that there is a rising trend in the prices which we gain for these goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in July this year I took the trouble to find out what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional Committee which was looking into the development of nuclear reactors in various countries had determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been a great deal of concern by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Nuclear Regulatory Commission and by the Foreign Operations Sub-Committee of the House Appropriations Committee relating to the development of the nuclear reactor in the Philippines which Australia is now to supply with uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me just go back to some of the concerns which have been expressed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee in relation to the development of the nuclear reactor in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all, in September 1972 at the instigation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the International Atomic Energy Agency visited the Philippines Atomic Research Centre to make a health and safety inspection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further piece of information which was advanced by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was the point that industrial, military and transportation facilities’ are nearby the reactor and that a special study of the situation ought to be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also noted that the same sort of situation pertained in the State of Maryland in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where it was proposed to establish a reactor at Perryman near a weapons proving ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Nuclear Regulatory Commission prevented work from proceeding on that nuclear power station in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> because of the presence of the proving ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the Filipino Energy Development Board- and this was also reported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee- found nuclear power to be much more expensive than coal, geothermal or hydro power in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Nuclear Regulatory Commission was concerned about the justification for the erection of a nuclear power plant in the Philippines in view of the findings of this body of the Philippines Government as to the costs of nuclear power in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other points I wish to raise were also raised, as I have said, by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee and they, of course, basically involve the question of the siting of a nuclear power station so close to a volcanic fault line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That volcano has not been active for some time but it was said by experts who gave evidence to the congressional committee in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that there is a very real problem in terms of the volcanic fault line near Subic Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about evidence that was given to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional Committee on the siting of the nuclear power station near Subic Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A question was asked at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee hearing about safety because of the proximity of two volcanoes to the plant site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In September 1976 the Philippines Atomic Energy Commission asked the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Embassy to determine whether the NRC would be willing to undertake a technical review of the preliminary report since it did not have the technical expertise nor the breadth of experience in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in May 1977 an official of the NRC expressed his concern that ‘we are being asked to provide two man-weeks worth of safety review for a foreign reactor when our average effort to review a licence application in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is in excess of six man years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of substantial concern to the committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress but, in the light of the agreement which has been tabled today, I doubt whether the same concern has been shown by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again my information comes from evidence before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only public discussion which has taken place in any open forum was in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress which predominantly is concerned not only about the contractual arrangements between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Philippines to provide hardware for the nuclear reactor but also about <span class="highlight">United States</span> military personnel at the naval base in Subic Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that everything I have said is wrong and that the agreements indicate that the Government has taken cognisance of the various points which have been of great concern to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress and clearly, in a more limited way, to the people of the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ostensibly they have come through reputable banking intermediaries in Europe, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not spelt out to the Australian community what has been the cost of borrowing in European currencies, while the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar and the Australian dollar with it have been falling substantially against those currencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth mentioning to the Senate that this report produced last October is already being used as a textbook in medical schools in this country, chapters from the report have been reprinted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada and have been widely distributed to members of the medical profession and other people who are likely to use it, and organisations concerned with the control of drugs and abuse have turned to this document in exactly the way that we hoped they would- to regard it as a flag driven into the ground, as the statement of a clear policy about which they can rally if they happen to agree with the propositions which we have advanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remarks in the  Lancet,  the remarks in the  Australian Medical Journal  and the favourable remarks from drug authorities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were very pleasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public broadcasting has well been established in countries like the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America since the late 1950s but it was not until 1972 that the first public report on public broadcasting- the report on FM radio- was made by the old Australian Broadcasting Control Board and accepted in principle by the McMahon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise that in referring to Alaska that legislation is before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have said that we will try to control uranium extraction whereas the <span class="highlight">United States</span> legislation to which I am referring, which is a Bill that was introduced into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress by Representatives Udall and Seibellin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one reads the article entitled ‘Preserving Alaska’ which I had incorporated in  Hansard  one will see that an area has been set aside for the bald faced eagle which is the symbol used on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> coat of arms and kindred designations related to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a recent report that the members of a Congressional Delegation from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which visited the People ‘s Republic of China in July were informed that China now recognised the existing realities in regard to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A delegation from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress, led by Representative Lester Wolff, visited China 3 July to 13 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the delegation ‘s return to Hong Kong  Mr Wolff  gave a press conference at which he is reported to have said that Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-Ping had told the delegation that China ‘recognised the realities’ of <span class="highlight">United States</span> involvement in Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other members of the delegation are reported to have emphasised, however, that China had not altered the main conditions for the normalisation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> relations with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, will the Minister investigate why officers of his Department came up with specifications which appear to be tailor made for a <span class="highlight">United States</span> aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has China purchased approximately one million tonnes of <span class="highlight">United States</span> wheat to make up for a shortfall in deliveries of wheat from Australia and Canada? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further to the honourable senator’s question, I am advised that China recently has purchased wheat from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America edition of the  Reader’s Digest  published in January 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the article was in the January 1977 edition of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  Reader’s Digest  and is titled ‘The Sobering Story of Australia’s Big Spending’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator has asked whether I would table a copy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  Readers’ Digest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is well aware that I said during my speech that I was quoting from the January 1977 <span class="highlight">United States</span> edition of the  Readers’ Digest  and gave the title of the article. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Madison, the principal author of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Constitution, campaigned for a strong Senate ‘as a check on the democracy: It cannot therefore be made too strong’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a common worry both in old federations such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in new ones such as West Germany and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate for the last year or more has been holding hearings on  President  Carter’s energy package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is power we are talking about, we have only to compare the power of a  chairman  of a major committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate with the power of a Minister in one of our recent governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the War of Independence for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, some fundamental principles of democracy were enumerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have an example of the most powerful country in the world, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, right before us in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would venture to say that under our present type of government, with encouragement of that nature, in 50 to 100 years Australia will be in a similar position to that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about the truth, something that the honourable senator does not like: He does not like the success that has been demonstrated by private enterprise in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taiwan is buying materials from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Japan, Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and is even getting uranium from South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A note of warning was given by President Carter of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America when he said that we should be providing uranium to those countries in order to fulfil their energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators probably know, I took the opportunity in the two-week parliamentary recess to visit Washington with senior officers of not only my own Department but also the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Trade and Resources for the purpose of having consultations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> AttorneyGeneral and representatives of his Department, the Department of State and the Federal Trade Commission concerning the extraterritorial application of antitrust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will recall that concern about the extraterritorial application of <span class="highlight">United States</span> antitrust laws led to the enactment of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orders were made under that Act prohibiting Australian based evidence from being used for the purpose of <span class="highlight">United States</span> legal proceedings concerning marketing arrangements for uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the orders were made the Australian Government and primarily my Department have had detailed exchanges with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government in relation to the grand jury inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that submissions that we made to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government in connection with the grand jury inquiry assisted the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities to reach their decision not to institute any such proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim was to explore how, for the future, the enforcement policies of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities might take account of the laws and policies of the Australian Government and the national interest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is anticipated that the heads of agreement on which the consultations took place will be considered in detail over the next two or three months by the Department of Justice and the other <span class="highlight">United States</span> departments involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mindful of the rightful protest that we made to the French Government over atomic tests in the Pacific, I ask: Are we now  making a protest to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government about its proposal to utilise islands to the north of Papua New Guinea to dump atomic waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that inquiries have been made in Washington about recent Press reports that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> plans to dispose of nuclear waste on South Pacific islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reports appear to reflect a misinterpretation of a study the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been making of the possibility of establishing regional repositories for spent nuclear fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> consideration of the idea of a spent fuel repository in the Asia-Pacific region apparently has gone no further than a preliminary examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No proposal has been made by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to locate such a repository in the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would not expect the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to do so without prior consultation with Pacific countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is fully aware of Australia’s position, as stated by the Prime Minister on 25 August 1977, that there is no intention of Australia’s storing other countries’ radio active wastes, nor, of course, has Australia given the <span class="highlight">United States</span> any encouragement to believe that a spent fuel repository in the South Pacific would be acceptable to regional countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to a recent report that a <span class="highlight">United States</span> agricultural laboratory has begun to mass produce an improved version of a little known seed innoculant called Azobac, which it claims will reduce the dependence of farmers on expensive nitrogen fertiliser by up to 20 per cent in the first year of use and increase crop yields by up to 50 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs relates to a recent decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal Trade Commission in which judgment was given against manufacturers of Anacin for a $24m bill for advertising to tell consumers that the manufacturer’s best selling analgesic was not a tension reliever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 2 March 1978  (Hansard,  page 269)  Senator Archer  addressed a question without notice to the Minister for Science concerning incentives for the installation of solar heating devices, possibly along the lines of a subsidy scheme formulated in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-61-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add that, according to the latest advice I have, the American subsidy system to which the honourable senator has referred is a provision in a Bill which, along with other energy Bills, is still in conference between the two Houses of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-61-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth that the Seismic Station situated at Schwartz Crescent in Alice Springs is a <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America Station operated by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America Air Force Detachment 42 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the 28th February 1978, a Government statement issued in the Senate indicated that the Seismic Station would be partly operated by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australian Governments from then and would be “open” to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Finance been drawn to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government report that solar power will be able to supply 20 per cent of America’s needs by the year 2000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress is strongly backing the further development of solar energy and that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is planning to give tax credits up to $2,000 for the installation of domestic solar heating units? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am unaware whether the Minister for Finance has had his attention drawn to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government report on solar power or whether any consideration has been given to the matter of tax deductions for the installation of solar heating units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is based on submissions I made during the adjournment debate a fortnight ago when I sought information on the acreage of the proposed Kakadu National Park as set out in the second report of  Mr Justice  Fox’s Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry as compared with the Alaskan parklands provided for in legislation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that the Government is aware through media reports that a spokesman for  Mr Smith  and his three black colleagues in the Executive Council has announced that they have been invited to visit the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and that the invitation has been accepted in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision on whether  Mr Smith  and his colleagues will be allowed to enter the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will of course be for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although Bishop Muzorewa and Reverend Sithole were recently in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the other black member of the Executive Council, Chief Chiaru, is understood to have twice been refused visas earlier this year, presumably because of his former status as Rhodesian senator and a Minister in the Smith Government which would bring him into the ambit of United Nations sanctions against those who are deemed to have furthered or encouraged the regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From 1860 onwards, Vermonts were imported from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hence,- we had new industries come to South Australia, not only from within Australia but also from the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the  chairman  of a Congressional committee under the system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has far more clout, far more authority, far more prestige and far more influence over decisions than a junior Minister has under the Australian Westminster style of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will explain that statement in due course by referring to what has happened in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, an increase in the number of jobs available has been seen to attract to the work force people who had not previously sought employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This does not occur only in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, Mobil’s work is being funded in part by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Energy, and I would hope that the more confidential aspects of the breakthrough would become available to Australia through the arrangements that this Government has made for the exchange of information on energy research, referred to in the Senate recently, that are being fostered by my colleague the Minister for National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the failure of the Australian Wine Board to use its long-standing power to trade overseas as an agent for wine producers, to organise the effective penetration of new markets in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan and countries in South East Asia, and to establish Government retail wine centres in cities other than London, despite the potential for such outlets in numerous other locations; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report, commenting on Australia’s wine future in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, says:   it must be re-emphasised, that the US markets are large and quite accessible to enterprising Australian winemakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With such an expanding market, the careful promotion of Australian wines, in particular areas of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, could be very successful and highly profitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one must realise that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there is a somewhat sophisticated market and, therefore, there is a demand for different types of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it shows that there is a great desire and demand for imported wines in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my inquiries I have found that many members of the industry seem to agree with these comments relating to the possibilities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not emphasise just the potential markets in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada because it seems to me that, with our vastly growing tourist trade with countries on the other side of the Pacific, such as Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and so forth, there are great opportunities for Australia if our wine industry can get out and sell and if it can get more encouragement from the Government to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter mentions the difficulties of promotion that arise in a number of countries and the fact that the Wine Board allocated a high proportion of its funds for overseas promotion in order to establish Australian wine in the promising <span class="highlight">United States</span> market through the appointment of a full time consultant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in 1 973 the Australian Wine Board spent $100,000 on a marketing campaign in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but, as I said, it failed to follow up on the exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever a person goes on the Continent, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or in Canada he will find that he is able to buy wines from different countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I discussed the problem of the wine industry and wine imports and exports in Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, France, Italy and Austria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever I have been able to get an Australian wine on the Continent, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America or Canada and I have had my friends present to drink it they have all admitted that it is of a superior quality to all others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am sure that if our industry were more efficient in promoting our wines in Europe, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada there would be the same reaction and people in those countries would buy Australian wines not only because of their quality but also for the snob value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of some interest that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America between 1973 and 1976 the voluntary $ 1 check-off on income tax had provided a fund of $95m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a mechanism wherby people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America may merely indicate that they want to have $ 1 taken from thentax and put into this fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware that, under existing <span class="highlight">United States</span>- Japanese nuclear power agreements, Washington ‘s approval is necessary for transport overseas of spent fuel from American uranium? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several articles of the Japan-<span class="highlight">United States</span> Nuclear Cooperation Agreement are relevant to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, Japan is required by that agreement to obtain the prior agreement of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to re-transfers of nuclear material supplied by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to reprocessing of irradiated fuel containing uranium received from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, such reprocessing may be performed in Japanese facilities upon a joint determination of the parties that the safeguards provisions may be effectively applied, or in such other facilities as may be mutually agreed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since a joint determination cannot be made without the United Slates consent, this gives the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a consent right for reprocessing in Japan or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conclusion of the type of long-term commercial arrangement which Japanese power companies are reported to have reached with a British company would in no way lessen the treaty obligations of the Japanese Government to obtain the prior consent of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government before actual retransfers or reprocessing takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the assertions made by  Mr Richard  Hall in a new publication called  The Secret State-  specifically those that allege that the KGB and other foreign intelligence organisations have infiltrated Australian intelligence organisations- will the Government consider establishing a confidential joint party parliamentary committee to review the activities and staffing of all Australian intelligence organisations along similar lines to the current practice in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made the further observation that such industries often consist of oligopolistic firms, as is the case in the motor industry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, or I suppose anywhere else, where an individual firm, firstly, has a very large income which can fund significant research and development expenditure and, secondly, has a sufficiently large share of the total market to ensure that the firm will be a principal beneficiary of any technical progress which might result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, as I found out on my visits overseas in the last year or so- it matters not whether one goes to Europe, the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or even Japan- that somewhat similar types of problems face the economies of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are in line with the Government’s policy to have a co-ordinated structure of State and Federal courts in Australia and to avoid the disadvantages of a dual court system which could easily develop under a federal system and which has caused so many problems in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The specified categories are children under the age of 1 8 years; crew members; diplomats; persons who arrive in Australia but are deemed under the Migration Act 1958 not to have entered Australia, that is persons who remain at the airport and persons who do not disembark from a ship; persons covered by the Status of Forces Agreements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Papua New Guinea; and persons being deported or extradited from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A second category is the straight passenger service charge and some examples include the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, $US3 a head; Hong Kong $A3 a head; Israel $5.70 a head; Singapore $4.00 a head and Malaysia $2.00 a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is somewhat above the charge being levied by countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where it is $3, and even Israel, where it is $5.70, it certainly is not going to be a huge burden on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that it is due to the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, which owns the area even though it is supposed to be a joint <span class="highlight">United States</span>-Australian facility, is probably either not telling the Department of Defence and the Australian Government precisely what is going on at Pine Gap or is misleading them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Defence,  Mr Allen  Fairhall, announced on December 1 1 that the Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> Governments had agreed to establish a joint United StatesAustralian Defence-Space Research Facility in the vicinity of Alice Springs, Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This facility, the Minister said, would be operated by the Australian Defence Department and the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the Lanham Trademark Act of 1946 included service marks as entitled to statutory protection under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, 42 other countries including major industrial countries, such as France, Italy, Sweden, Canada and the USSR and neighbouring countries, such as the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea had, by the end of 1970, introduced legislation providing statutory protection for marks for services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While legislation of this kind has been in operation in Sweden for a long time and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for some 1 1 or 12 years, this is the first Bill on the subject to be introduced into any country with a system of government that clearly parallels our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to achieve the reasonable objectives of open government in the British context, where the policies and decisions of the executives are under constant and vigilant scrutiny by Parliament and Ministers are directly answerable in Parliament, it may be neither necessary nor desirable to proceed to legislation of a kind which may be justifiable in other and often very different contexts- for instance, that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his statement to the House of Representatives of 9 May 1978, the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined the Australian Government ‘s approach to human rights, including the question- under close study in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress- of attaching human rights criteria to decisions on the eligibility of governments for loans from international financial institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that for some time now the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been deeply involved in negotiations to find an acceptable settlement to Rhodesia’s problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to admit  Mr Smith  on this occasion should be seen in this light and is consistent with the continuing efforts by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration to use its considerable influence to bring about a peaceful, negotiated solution in Rhodesia rather than in the strict context of the United Nations sanctions against Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The interests of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are also keenly involved and have led, for example, to renewed efforts by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to try to reconcile the conflict of interests and attitudes in the eastern Mediterranean which undoubtedly have complicated the Cyprus problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he will now arrange for a national inquiry into the manufacture and use of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in Australia which is open to the media and the public and which: (1) ensures it receives evidence or depositions from scientists outside Australia, especially from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Sweden and Holland; (2) considers the implications of the volatile bases on which these herbicides are manufactured, which permits the spray mist to remain in the air for long periods and to drift many miles in some circumstances; (3) considers the desirability of larger spray nozzle aperture sizes or other methods of use that might reduce air retention and spray drift; (4) considers the desirability of banning the use of herbicides in urban areas or within one kilometre of a dwelling place, as is the practice in some European countries; (5) considers the current practice of packagers of printing directions for use on packages in very fine type; and (6) considers the desirability of an indefinite delay in conversion of instructions for use on such herbicide packets to metric measurements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In case he is not aware of this, I preface my question by telling him that the Prime Minister announced in the House a short time ago that the Minister for Primary Industry would be leaving this evening for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress to block the sugar Bill for domestic reasons, how long is this decision expected to prolong the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ratification of the International Sugar Agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government certainly is very concerned that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not yet passed legislation to enable it to participate fully in the International Sugar Agreement before the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government remains confident that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will ratify the agreement, although this cannot now occur this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no doubt that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> recognises the importance of the agreement and of its responsibilities to the international sugar community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to become a full member this year has implications for the successful operation of the Agreement, but it is obviously in the interests of the exporters that the members of the Agreement should continue to apply its full disciplines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will continue to be in close contact with other interested countries and will continue to liaise closely with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration in order to ensure that the Agreement is maintained and continues to operate as effectively as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the continued tragic deaths in Rhodesia of so many black and white people being killed by black guerrillas, will the Australian Government encourage the major powers- the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America- to take steps to stop the current butchery by the insurgent guerrillas which is doing nothing to bring about a peaceful solution in Rhodesia, but rather is only bringing about increasing and continuing tragedy to all people in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the present excursion to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of  Mr Sinclair  with the announced intention of rescuing the Australian beef industry from the effect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> beef legislation now awaiting presidential assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not the case that it has been widely known and acknowledged among <span class="highlight">United States</span> political and agricultural writers for months that this legislation was essentially a domestic, political stunt motivated primarily by a desire to appease midwestern beef producers in the congressional election due in the first week of November? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not the case also that it is universally anticipated in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that the  President  will make use of this so-called pocket veto and the legislation will lapse accordingly and that, as a result,  Mr Sinclair’s  visit will make no conceivable difference whatsoever to the outcome? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask why no Minister went to Washington earlier this month to try to head off congressional rejection of the ratification of the International Sugar Agreement which has at least equally serious implications for Australian exports as the beef legislation passed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Does the Minister have any power similar to that recently adopted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to ban- I repeat ‘ban’- foreign vessels which have a history of pollution accidents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that initial tests conducted within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on the FI 1 1 weapons bay gun system indicated that both the aircraft gun and the airframe needed minor modification to solve problems associated with gun vibrations and aircraft skin rippling in the vicinity of the gun muzzle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can follow the pattern movement of employment from the secondary sector to the tertiary sector in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australians blithely assumed that the same would happen here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spoke today with a member of the embassy in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what other countries are doing, not only the countries of Europe which have social democratic governments but also the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where vast numbers of people are looking at this sort of system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s expenditure on health used to be roughly mid-way between the high expenditure in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the relatively low expenditure in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr Chu  is reported to have said, the Taiwan Power Company currently purchases its nuclear fuel from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>’ requirements as to nuclear safeguards are similar to Australia’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, unlike Australia, recognises the ‘Republic of China Government’ and is therefore able to have a nuclear co-operation safeguards agreement with it and to export nuclear material to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has received what amounts to a snub from the Australian Government when seeking top level talks with Australia on cut-rate fares for the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to know whether the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  was informed because I understand that there is an obligation by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to supply the Australian Government with full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relative to the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been well known, for the last few months several Bills have been floating around the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress, the object of which, in this <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional election year, was to impose, or seem to impose, further restrictions on the importation of beef to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also fairly widely recognised that most of this political activity in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress could be described as political stunting, grandstanding by politicians who represented the cattle States and who, prior to the congressional elections of next month, were attempting to ingratiate themselves with their electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13 October the news came through to Australia that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives had, in fact, passed a Bill which at least opened the possibility that, in addition to the restrictions already in force, Australian beef imports would be restricted if not immediately then at some time in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  issued on 13 October a statement in which he referred to having just received news from Washington that the House of Representatives had passed a Bill that would modify the present law governing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> meat imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have recently made strong representations to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government on this matter and am hopeful that these representations will be taken into account by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress had refused to ratify that Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress had the week before refused to ratify the International Sugar Agreement yet no action that we are aware of was taken by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, no Minister was despatched to Washington to lobby the Congress or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration, either prior to or subsequent to the congressional rejection of the ratification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Press statement on the ISA appears to have been issued by  Mr Anthony  or  Mr Sinclair  when the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress failed to ratify it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the Melbourne  Age  of 1 9 October in an article with respect to  Mr Sinclair’s  visit to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>-  Mr Sinclair  was that day arriving in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- Creighton Burns said:  although they - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I observe again in passing that I would have expected a journalist who has spent as much time in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as  Mr Costigan  had done to be a ware of that strong probability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is  Mr Anthony’s  view it begs the question: Was not the Government grossly negligent in completely ignoring the passage of this legislation in the couple of months it was kicking around the Congress, in taking no action in the time it was actually before the Congress, in taking no action on the day it was passed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives and no action in any of the three days thereafter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would need to have an extraordinarily poor opinion of the competence of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Embassy in Canberra to believe that it had not fully briefed the American Administration on the article which had appeared in the  Bulletin  on the day it was published and on other matters pertaining to the investigation of  Mr Sinclair’s  business affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have expected that to be the normal reaction of the governments of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom or just about any other country with which we have a substantial trade to visits by Australian Ministers on trade negotiations in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, relates to the construction in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of three patrol frigates for the Royal Australian Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government aware that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is currently investigating the liquidity of the Todd Shipbuilding Corporation which is constructing the three frigates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The memorandum of arrangements provides for a withdrawal by Australia from the FFG program for a number of contingent reasons, including a significant change in cost factors and poor performance in lead ship trials, in which event the <span class="highlight">United States</span> shall consider accepting the Royal Australian Navy ships and associated equipment with equitable reimbursement to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister become aware that the continued decline in the score of the scholastic aptitude tests taken in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by candidates for higher education has not been uniform and that some schools have maintained their scores in that test? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  am advised that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government has formally advised the Australian Government of the financial difficulties of the Todd Shipbuilding Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The contracts for the Royal Australian Navy FFG ships are between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government which, in turn, has placed <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy contracts, including contracts for three ships to be constructed by Todd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With Royal Australian Air Force aircraft now providing services to the Australian Antarctic bases by operating out of New Zealand in conjunction with and supplementing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and New Zealand air force transport pool, will the Minister advise for how long these arrangements are to continue and whether it is proposed that consideration be given to the eventual establishment of a base in Tasmania for these operational flights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the same operational reasons as affect RAAF aircraft, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy must operate from Christchurch and consequently would not contemplate a shift of location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the last 12 months a major manufacturer mentioned to me that during his visits to places such as the Philippines, Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, despite ‘sweat workhouse’ conditions in some of those countries, he could not find one case where the output per employee for a certain packaged lingerie item exceeded on average production in his own plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is agreed that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Australia and Canada are all multi-cultural communities and that the people in these countries have played a big role in the development of these countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has an average annual growth in its labour force of about 2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the pressures during that period in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Canada, unlike Australia perhaps, came from that fast growing teenage labour force which within Australia was being absorbed very largely into the education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The teenage labour force of both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada grew at an average rate of 4.3 per cent during that period whereas Australia’s teenage labour force grew at an average rate of only 0.4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia there is likely to be a very significant growth in the number of teenagers coming into the labour market whereas in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada the reverse will be true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expressed in terms of Australian dollars Australia’s imports in 1975 and 1976, respectively, were 2.14 per cent and 2.43 per cent compared to 0.63 per cent and 0.88 per cent for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>; 0.51 per cent and 1.44 per cent for the European Economic Community; and 0.25 per cent and 0.3 1 per cent for Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My further advice is that the United Kingdom, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canadian Governments concluded bilateral treaties with the Government of the Polish People’s Republic in 1954, 1960 and 1971 respectively, providing for compensation for their nationals whose property was nationalised or expropriated by Polish measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that prior to 1880 neither in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> nor in Australia was there any legislation or legislative prohibition of any kind on abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only in the 1 880s and 1 890s that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, because the medical profession felt that so many abortions were being performed by totally unqualified people, pressure was engendered for the introduction of legislation which made an abortion a criminal offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I give the following information: Firstly, concerning escalation in the contracts for the ships, as explained earlier, the contracts for the Royal Australian Navy FFGs are between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government which in turn has placed <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy contracts including our three ships with the shipbuilder, Todd Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These estimates are subject to day to day review and control by the Defence Department in Canberra and by Australian personnel who are placed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy FFG project office in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Concerning notification of the financial situation of the shipbuilder, official advice of Todd Pacific’s present difficulties was provided by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy in a letter dated 23 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government, as a matter of routine, investigates the financial soundness of all bidders on major defence contracts and makes several such investigations of the ship builders involved when awarding FFG contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1977, with <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government assistance, Todd restructured its organisation, including forming a subsidiary company to operate the building yards at which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy and the Royal Australian Navy work is undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1976 we spent on promotion in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> $7,000, and in 1977 the amount fell to $1,600. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am appalled to think that in 1976 we spent only $7,700 in promoting Australian wine in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and a year later, in 1977 the amount dropped to $1,600. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, that would not pay for a one-page advertisement in a newspaper in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns the construction in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of three patrol frigates for the Royal Australian Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally the Labor Government, in April 1974, decided to order two of these vessels in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August of that year the then Government entered into a memorandum of arrangements with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, clause 8 of that memorandum obliges the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to provide certain information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that Todd Pacific, the shipbuilders, has orders worth over $845m for FFG ships, including 14 of the 26 ships on order for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time we find that the escalation of the cost of construction of these vessels for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has been approximately the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are currently estimated to be costing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government $200m also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> this new system of detection has been under very severe criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> Government has decided that it is necessary to augment it with an additional type of submarine detection equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the limited time available to me I want to read an extract from the transcript of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to remember that two of the three contractors for these vessels in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in fact are the same company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all probability it will be worse in terms of the escalation of costs and I believe that the Government is obliged to ascertain from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government the exact position in respect of these vessels and to advise the Parliament accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In correspondence with the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  as a result of certain statements made in the defence estimates, he reminded me that the Australian ratio of civilians to servicemen is half that of the United Kingdom and 20 per cent below that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> at no stage has rejected ratification of the International Sugar Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, separate Senate acceptance of the International Sugar Agreement would have been and still is required before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could ratify the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration remains committed to ratification of the International Sugar Agreement and I am confident it will achieve that objective early in 1979 when the new Congress is convened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, with the uncertainty still surrounding the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar and the slow pace of economic recovery in the Northern Hemisphere, it would be presumptuous of us- and I dare say shortsighted- to believe that the mine’s problems will have disappeared by the early 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of such a withdrawal by the AMLC or a reversion to the free market so far as we, the sellers, are concerned, would, of course, be to transfer enormous profits to those who manage to import the meat into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although beef producers have received a reprieve as a result of domestic action taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  in the last few months, this does not mean that the problems of the beef industry in Australia have been overcome- not by any means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Senate that there were many indications in the newspapers just two or three months before the increase in the rate of exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> resulting in a lifting in beef prices, which showed a different and extremely pessimistic attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would seem to indicate that the recent- and possibly temporary- change in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> market does not so quickly eliminate the problems of the beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it is true that the low rate of mishap associated with nuclear power houses over the last two decades has been due in no small part to the fact that it is the highly developed nations technologically, such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, West Germany and Japan, amongst others, which have built and maintained the reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not my own personal view; it has been stated repeatedly by nuclear scientists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who have pleaded with their Government to intervene and try to persuade the Marcos family, which is dominating ownership and control of this reactor, to move the reactor to a safer area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One method of overcoming this problem is ‘sunset’ legislation, now widely used in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, whereby the enabling Act for an authority imposes a time limit at the end of which the authority automatically disbands unless specifically authorised to continue by new legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of interest to note that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> today it has been put to the motor industry that it should re-think completely the design of the motor car, and I think that relates to whether niters for lead should be fitted or whether there should be other devices, which of course have been bringing about greater fuel consumption, as the honourable senator suggested, and less efficiency in the standard engine produced today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as my predecessor,  Mr Ellicott,  explained in introducing the 1976 Bill, the need for it had arisen out of legal proceedings that were being taken in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America under the antitrust legislation of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ellicott ‘s second reading speech in relation to the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill also explained that in the proceedings I have just mentioned claims were being made that the antitrust and related laws of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had a greater extra-territorial operation than that generally conceded in international law, and beyond what other countries were prepared to concede in the proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The orders have been effective in preventing the Australian-based evidence from being used for the purpose of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate, moreover, that the grand jury inquiry into the uranium marketing arrangements has been concluded and that no proceedings by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Justice Department have been instituted against any Australian company in consequence of that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those proceedings nine non-<span class="highlight">United States</span> defendants declined to enter appearances: They did this because they considered there were jurisdictional objections to the proceedings against them and that they might be taken to have waived those objections if they were to enter appearances: The effect of their not entering appearances has been the entry by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> court of a default judgment against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with the exception of the South Australian legislation, the applicability of their provisions in relation to a judgment of a particular country is dependent on an order in council being made upon satisfaction that substantial reciprocity is assured from that country, and no such order in council has been made in respect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate will recall that on 14 September last year, in answer to a question by  Senator Young,  I reported on the outcome of certain consultations that had just been had in Washington with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Attorney-General and representatives of his Department concerning the extraterritorial application of antitrust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That allowed for a period during which the heads of agreement on which the consultations took place could be considered in detail by the Department of Justice and other <span class="highlight">United States</span> departments involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present position in relation to those consultations is that we are still awaiting the response of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities on the proposed heads of agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response will not, however, render the present Bill unnecessary, because the proposals we are exploring with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities will be applicable only in respect of future marketing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development noted the statement by the Vice-President of Exxon Chemicals of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>,  Mr Ron  Grandy at a meeting yesterday of the Australian Chemical Industry Council, pointing out that there is a tendency towards increasing international trade in chemicals and that this trend is likely to intensify away from nations in Western Europe, and Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that in Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> credit card laws protect the consumer in those circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> and China have established full diplomatic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a welcome move that will assist the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to pursue a more fully developed policy in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> policy has in the past been inhibited by a lack of formal recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year we have achieved the best access ever to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for our meat exports, and we are approaching the end of the bilateral negotiations for long term access to the American market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a most significant progress, especially since while our interest rates fell over 1978 <span class="highlight">United States</span> interest rates were rising by up to 4 per cent, those in the United Kingdom by up to 5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement referred to the three guided missile frigates being purchased from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, but it did not point out that the Government has had no information about the cost of those frigates since mid- 1977, it did not point out that those frigates are going to be used for purposes for which they were not even designed, it . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian export industries have benefited from the decline in the value of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar because of its pre-eminence in the index system used for adjusting the value of the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Prime Minister has failed to say is that the Australian export industries are benefiting from the problems of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> economy and the outlook in that direction is not at all hopeful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be realistic and as the Prime Minister is now starting to recognise, Australia cannot insulate itself from overseas influences, particularly those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall now make just a few comments about the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what policies this Government adopts, the prospect for improved exports lies ultimately with the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to sustain powerful economic recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, this Government has failed to fulfil its commitment to complete an International Grains Arrangement and the International Sugar Agreement is teetering on the edge of failure because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not yet ratified the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of” America with its new-found energy consciousness that realisation is growing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a problem which has dogged the <span class="highlight">United States</span> judicial system for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the printing was far too small in terms of numbers and far too many of them were immediately despatched to major philatelic outlets in the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> so that in Australia, bearing in mind the relationship between the Australian Postal Commission and the philatelic services of Christmas Island, there were very few, if any, of these sets available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind- I think this is so in many other countries, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- legal aid should not be regarded as being just for the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know the situation of exPresident Nixon in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but also I think one could say that the main reason for the resignation of the ex-Chancellor of West Germany, Willy Brandt, was an aide’s deception for which he took full responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of laws now in force in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> that I should think would be opposed by a large number of Government members in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that impressed me very much was to be able to go to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> electoral commission and be able to purchase for 10 cents a page a list of all the donations for that day ranging from $5 upwards that had been made to Presidential candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This motion calls for the essential preliminary steps in the development of a balancing House of review somewhat along the lines of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure we do not want to go the whole way of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> system with its rigid separation of powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was in Washington last year I looked with some care at the procedures of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is much we can learn from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate procedures although, of course, we must recognise that it operates under a very different political structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is power we are talking about, I invite honourable senators to compare the power of a  chairman  of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate committee with the power of a Minister in one of our recent governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the practice in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than delay the Senate I had preliminary talks this afternoon with departmental staff and I now ask that a four-page document dealing with the history of this society and naming the <span class="highlight">United States</span> national who is seeking a conversion of his visa from tourist to working status be incorporated in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised by the Minister for Health that requests for curtailment have arisen, not from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America as might have been suggested in some reports, but from the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few years, and for a variety of reasons, one of the superpowers, the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, has adopted a lower posture and a strategically less active policy towards the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many, inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and outside it, have welcomed this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there were special problems in the aftermath of the war; but it seemed that these were gradually being resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week, the Government with other governments including the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Japan called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the changes which have taken place at that level- the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and China, the expansion of Japan’s relations with China- are in themselves desirable; but what significance they will ultimately have will depend on how they fit into a picture which is not yet complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were the tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars which Australia expended in the effort by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America to try to determine the course of events within Vietnam- actions unacceptable on the world scene which should never have been condoned and which should never have been embarked upon in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China has now taken the view, for reasons best understood by itself, that it wishes to take a much different and more conciliatory approach towards the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who took the trouble to read the interview with the Chinese Vice Premier, Deng Xiaoping, in  Time  magazine only two or three weeks ago would not be left with any illusions as to the reason for China’s new approach to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has adopted a lower posture so far as the Third World countries are concerned and we all know the reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said then that it will take generations of <span class="highlight">United States</span> presidents to overcome the effect of that war on the <span class="highlight">United States</span> community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No American  president  is going to leave himself open to that again, hence the reason for this much more cautious approach now being taken by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a sorry record this Government and the governments of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Western Europe have in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> then moved into that country and bolstered up various puppet regimes which clearly again did not have the support of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thousands upon thousands of people from our own country and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as well as from Indo-China died trying to preserve regimes which obviously could not last, whatever the morality of it may have been, and were bound to be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here I refer specifically to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and even more specifically to the Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It did intervene on behalf of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we and the dithering Administration in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are embarked on precisely the same course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By basing our approach to the Government in Iran on what served the short term economic interests of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and other Western countries, we finished up with the debacle with which we are now faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is likely that the fighting in Vietnam will bog down, as it did between the French and the Vietnamese and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would these struggles and wars have reached this tempo if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had not stepped back several steps and if it had not, as the paper stated, adopted a lower posture? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps some people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> felt that by taking this action there would be less trouble in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> reduced its posture by stepping backwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has done is to allow the communist countries to exercise their full power in many countries throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad to see that Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> are not going to support a puppet regime which I believe will fail regardless of the results in that election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that for once the foreign policies of Great Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will be proved correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This conflict marks the entry of Sino-Soviet rivalry into the politics of the region on a scale greater than the rivalry between those two powers in Africa, or that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union in other part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amazes me that some government back benchers, some of the very same people who gave unqualified support to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in its wars in Vietnam, are now giving unqualified support to Chinese military action in the very same country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to read in the newspapers some of the comments from the former hawks in that last conflict to see that there is muted admiration that somebody else has taken up the military position of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had had a decent intelligence operation going in Iran, surely it would have known that the key to the whole of the conflict in that country was the political control of the 30,000 oil workers who brought down the former government and who could bring down the present government if they decided to take more political action and not to get the oil moving again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> gave him unqualified support a matter of 24 hours after he was made Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what is happening in Vietnam and despite the argument between the Soviet Union and China, we still have an acceptance by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union that detente ought to be achieved and that the SALT discussions ought to be concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many, inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and outside it, have welcomed this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an encouragement for people to assume that one way or another the <span class="highlight">United States</span> may well employ a military action, as it has done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out by members of the Opposition with regard to the origins of trouble in this area, certainly the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia and other countries saw the Vietnam war as one which must have a military solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be assisting in reducing tensions and we certainly should make sure that the present encouraging relationship between the Soviet Union and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America is preserved and pointed to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is not hard to see that the Soviet Union might feel that Europe, Japan, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and China are in fact in many ways aligned against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only add that in the context of the tendency towards alignment between Europe, Japan, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and China, Australia obviously falls into that group along with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations and the countries of the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that context also that we ought to look at our treaty with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in his statement this afternoon referred to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few years, and for a variety of reasons, one of the super powers- the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- has adopted a lower posture and a strategically less active policy towards the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many, inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and outside it, have welcomed this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s words are very diplomatic but I think that statement reflects the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> must inescapably adopt a position of active leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is to happen it is important that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should give a lead in that process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must say that we, like many others, look to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for more effective leadership, for more decisive action, and it may be worth recalling that in 1976, the Foreign Minister, in his statement to the National Press Club, to which I have already referred, made the following statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strange as it may seem, having heard the sort of emotional talk that has gone on today, no well-established damage to reefs by oil can be quoted and drilling is carried out in South East Asia, the Middle East, the Red Sea, the southern <span class="highlight">United States</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the environmental effects, there is no doubt that the series of tanker accidents off the coasts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, French and Spanish coasts and the blow-out in the North Sea have reinforced public concern and scientific interest in the long-term effects of oil on marine and estuarine ecosystems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On many occasions committees of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate, have had to protect that area from certain greedy commercial interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is a  Newsweek  clipping that deals with the ecology cycle when an oil spill occurred in the Nantucket area on the coast of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To indicate how we have to have forward thinking, I ask that a letter which “I received from  Senator Ed  Muskie, who, as honourable senators know, represents the coastline State of Maine, also be incorporated in  Hansard,  together with a further clipping from the New York  Times  which refers to the current climate in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">United States</span> coastal and inland waters alone there are as many as 13,000 spills, large and small, every year, aggregating around 20 million gallons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also .before Congress is a tanker safety bill laying down requirements for construction, personnel and navigation equipment for any vessels that want to enter <span class="highlight">United States</span> ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is long past the rime for comprehensive legislation which provides not only for adequate liability for oil spills but also for establishment of minimum standards for the construction, operation and maintenance of vessels which want to use the ports of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the ships are going to use the ports of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- if they are going to ply our waters- then they should meet the same level of performance demanded for ships which operate under the American flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given the difficult and sensitive nature of the settlement process in Namibia, the negotiations initiated by the Western Five- the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Canada- have been long and exhaustive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why did we not support the proposal by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and France to ban the exploitation of the sperm whale? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that during the last 12 months ISO New Zealand scientists and 300 <span class="highlight">United States</span> scientists were able to do valuable research work at their bases due to excellent transport facilities being available to them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I readily acknowledge that citizen initiative does enjoy some current popularity in certain overseas countries, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, it is true that the idea of citizen initiative and a referendum dates from the time, and was most fashionable at the time, when nations were essentially run by elites elected by rich and powerful minorities, when full adult franchise was unknown, when representative democracy was not fully developed, and when there was genuine frustration at the absence of an opportunity for the popular voice to make itself heard in the business of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take a familiar and recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> example, it is widely accepted that the defeat of a Californian initiative proposal for a ban on smoking in public places was primarily due to a massive $5m advertising campaign by the tobacco industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>89 on the Notice Paper- by  Senator Mason  relating to the whole subject of democracy by referendum as against representative democracy, which is a question that has arisen in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in particular in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will, I think, recall that on one previous occasion, in an atmosphere of high drama, we met here to deal with legislation relating to the action by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which was brought against 29 companies, some of them domestic <span class="highlight">United States</span> companies, and some of them foreign companies registered in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case Westinghouse alleged price fixing agreements contrary to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose was to deal with the particular proceedings in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> courts to which I referred earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the prohibition against certain evidence being given in those proceedings in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> does not, however, go far enough to exempt the four Australian companies, to which I have referred, from the provisions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the present Bill is to provide that certain anti-trust judgments made in <span class="highlight">United States</span> or foreign courts- but the <span class="highlight">United States</span> courts in particular- are not recognised or enforceable in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would like to think that we lived in a perfect world in which we in Australia fully respected the rather forceful antitrust legislation which exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and were prepared to enforce their judgments here, but of” course we do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>said, to assist the courts of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in anti-trust proceedings, and while we should be ready to meet with <span class="highlight">United States</span> officials to explore means of limiting any harmful effect on their economy which may originate in this country, the limits of our ability to co-operate must be set by two principles: that we cannot co-operate where the action proposed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is inconsistent with our conception of international law, nor can we permit action here which we judge to be contrary to our public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Foreign Antitrust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Bill 1979 brings to a sort of finality a dispute which has been festering between the Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> Governments for some years, particularly in relation to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it brings the matter to a sort of finality because no doubt this Bill, if it becomes law, will be seen to be only a step in the further negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Attorney-General in particular over the enforcement in Australia of judgments of <span class="highlight">United States</span> courts in anti-trust proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is very clearly given, namely, that Australian companies will be affected by <span class="highlight">United States</span> judgments within Australia only if the Government thinks it is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The damages awarded, particularly under treble damages provisions, against Australian companies for colluding in arrangements which force up the price of metals sold in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, for example, may be so astronomical that the effect of allowing the enforcement of the award in Australia would be crippling to the companies concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, and no doubt there always will be, a basic conflict of interest between say, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> purchasers of Australian resources, whether they be alumina, zinc, uranium or natural gas, and the Australian business enterprise exporting the commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly a cartel of cooperative bidders in relation to a particular commodity is the last thing with which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> purchaser wants to be confronted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is our legal system’s answer to the use by <span class="highlight">United States</span> consumers of their legal system to protect their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that the decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Justice to enforce vigorously its anti-trust legislation against overseas resource companies selling minerals and energy products in the US is simply a part of the US consumers’ effort to strengthen their bargaining position in the world market for the sorts of commodities that we can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example- I pose this question so that the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  may be able to help the Opposition- if the Attorney-General were to decide that it is not in the national interest that some Australian company should pay some millions of dollars awarded by way of punitive damages in a <span class="highlight">United States</span> judgment, but that in his view compensation might properly be payable to the US plaintiff for loss actually proved, and as a consequence ordered that the amount of damages for which the judgment could be enforced in Australia be reduced from say $3m to $500,000, then on publication in the Gazette would not the judgment for the reduced amount become immediately enforceable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we understand that the basic purpose of the Bill is to ensure that certain anti-trust judgments passed in foreign courts are not recognised and are not enforceable in Australia, we have some difficulty with the general principle that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> law, as judged by that country in regard to its own sort of national interest, ought to apply in respect of operations of companies whose activities are designed chiefly with the Australian national interest in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of circumstances in which Australia’s national interest in respect of the export of minerals and the activities of the various firms which are engaged in exporting certainly needs to be protected against the sort of law that applies in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arises out of rather unhappy circumstances which have arisen as a result of the wide application that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America gives to its anti-trust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that end, we have been holding very extensive consultations with the Department of Justice in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to try to see whether there are ways of preventing conflicts of this type arising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, in one sense the damage has been done in that judgments have been entered, but there does not seem to be any way under American law and from negotiations we have had with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to undo that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is only fair to say that even if we do reach agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on this matter it still will be very difficult to apply that situation to civil proceedings and to gain damages in those proceedings, because this is a case between private litigants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be difficult to gain an intervention by a Government- in this case the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government- into those proceedings or to provide for a court to take account of the sorts of considerations which basically are political considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, in theory it would be better if they could be exercised by a court in Australia, but we recognise that really that is not feasible and in discussions we have had with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government it has expressed the same concern about how it could introduce these sorts of considerations into its private civil processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That might also be of importance in relation to achieving comity with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the discussions that we have had, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities may be prepared to accept more readily that treble damages judgments not be enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> where computer technology is much advanced we have seen a number of examples where both private and government employees have been able to fiddle the system- I suppose that is the correct term to use- for a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been operating in commercial enterprise in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for many years and subsequently has been introduced into government agencies in other northern hemisphere countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also are well established in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in some European countries, certainly in Sweden and Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a system, as has been said, which was pioneered in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and indeed is so well entrenched there now, that the Government Auditing Office in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> devotes only about 10 per cent of its resources to the traditional financial audit and 90 per cent of its resources to efficiency and program auditing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will need to be gained by the Auditor-General over a period just as the Comptroller-General in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had to gain his knowledge when efficiency audits were introduced some 1 5 years or 20 years ago in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, somewhat similar arrangements have been followed for many years in other countries- for instance, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America- in relation to secret expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made the point that so often statistics can be conveniently used and that really one could show that the progression in the rate of lung cancer in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> equated with the increase in the consumption of cigarettes, but it also equated with the increase in the number of Toyota or Japanese cars and that, if you like to graph them both out, you could prove equally that it was caused either by the consumption of cigarettes or the increase in the number of Toyota or Japanese cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can therefore be seen that the television set, as a means of communication and thereby as a means of influencing both development and behaviour, is so widespread throughout the Australian community that only the <span class="highlight">United States</span> may be said to be in a worse position- and I use that term advisedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report itself draws attention to this behaviour of parental authorities by quoting evidence from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in which a committee responsible for producing a report entitled ‘Television and Growing Up: The Impact of Televised Violence’ reported as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly true that if one were to observe over a prolonged period the nature of social relationships, the nature of physical relationships and the nature of sheer physical conditions of living in which most of these television soap operas and most of the television programs tend to be shown, one would get without doubt the most unrealistic picture of life in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Great Britain, Australia or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that neither the <span class="highlight">United States</span> nor other powers have made any attempt to assist in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the decision by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to abrogate its treaty with Taiwan and the recent statement by Admiral Zumwalt, a <span class="highlight">United States</span> Admiral, in Australia that signalled a clear warning to this country that we have to rely more on our own efforts for defence, has the Government considered the possible implications for <span class="highlight">United States</span> commitments to the ANZUS Treaty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government remain firm in its belief that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is as committed to the ANZUS Treaty as has been the case in the past? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that  Mr Kelly  has called on the Commonwealth Government to close down the tobacco industry in Australia so that the Government can trade off cuts in the tariff on <span class="highlight">United States</span> tobacco imports for lower <span class="highlight">United States</span> duties on Australian wool? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has he seen that Qantas has now developed a new advertising style for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America based on the premise that Americans are unable to understand the language, grammar and slang of Australians, and should therefore be made familiar with the way in which the average Australian talks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have reached an interim agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which has resulted in quite dramatic reductions in fares between Sydney and Melbourne and the American West Coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that as of November 1978 the average air fare in Europe, expressed in <span class="highlight">United States</span> cents per mile, was 31.7c; in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the average air fare was 13.4c per mile; and in Australia the average normal economy fare was 13.7 US cents per mile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that Australia’s air fares are fractionally above those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and less than half the average in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Examples are given for varying distances in Europe, and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wisdom of that advice can be seen in the light of the mistake that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America made in taking sides with the previous regime in Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that Australia should not blindly follow the advice of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed that the Prime Minister of this country did not publicly deplore the recent statements by the beleaguered  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the conflict in Vietnam that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could not stand by and see this happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have little doubt that if Australia’s territorial integrity were attacked by a neighbour the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would come to our aid in some form or other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, we could have deplored the <span class="highlight">United States</span> President’s inflammatory brinkmanship, the rather pathetic statement that they cannot stand by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> gives tax credits of up to 55 per cent of the total cost of solar devices as an encouragement to conserve energy resources by using energy from the sun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A view expressed principally in the first instance by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and to some extent by the United Kingdom and certainly by the conservative governments in our part of the world is that we have a bounden duty to take a position opposite to whatever may be the point of view expressed by certain countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me from the document to which I have referred that this Government is following very closely, the policies being pursued by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has adopted a lower posture and a strategically less active policy towards the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The might of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America was thrown into Vietnam, with our support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those in our country and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has the power, the wisdom and the obligation to decide the future of nations everywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there are Democrats and Republicans who have changed from being hawks to doves in respect of that war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We continue  therefore  that same sort of superficial analysis which has been spoken of by those who give a huie more attention to the issues and which clearly is reflected in different attitudes, even in the top echelons in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that there are people in influential positions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> who take a much broader view than that which is found in this document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was then involved in a war with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the real villain in the whole picture, contributed nothing- no money at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He reported back to the American Government that Vietnam desired to resume economic links with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> despite the subjectivism that obviously existed at the end of the long drawn out war, during which the mighty <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had been humbled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was of course done in the face of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> trade embargo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then went to the appropriate Minister and asked him to exercise his good offices to persuade the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to accept part responsibility for the devastation and the problems that existed in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing but ignorance of what our responsibilities were, nothing but ignorance about what our role should be, nothing but ignorance about attempting to influence the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and nothing but anti-Soviet hysteria- that is what has emanated from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we call for an immediate withdrawal of all Chinese forces from Vietnam to allow negotiations to begin and call on <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to avoid any action or statement that could provoke a further escalation or inhibit the resolution of the conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it is all the fault of Australia that the Vietnamese are the friends of the Soviet Union because we and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have not given support to the Vietnamese and have forced them into the arms of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what  Senator Gietzelt  would have said if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had given to Vietnam the support which he accused the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America of not giving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he would have said that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was again wanting to buy another country and take it over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is saying that because the Vietnamese turned to the Soviet Union the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is one of the bad boys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commence by referring to the section at the bottom of page 5 of the statement made by the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  in which the Minister drew attention to the very low posture that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has maintained in the present conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No wonder the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a bit dubious about being involved in those sorts of situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had adopted the same posture as Britain did in Vietnam and had stayed out of it, no doubt we would have had an amalgamation of Vietnam then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that had occurred, would the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia not have been in a far better position to provide United Nations peacekeeping troops if our hands had been clean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that sometimes the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America bails them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in Portugal could be changed if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in particular played a more vigorous role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one only has to look at Guatemala and other places to realise the ruthless way in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> responded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me the question is not whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Soviet Union or China are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it was a combined British and <span class="highlight">United States</span> effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a  National Times  article March 6-11,1978, stated: Australia is to play a much more significant role in the strategic weapons plan of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Soviet Union and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in the past, we criticised the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for its position in Indo-China, then surely we should be criticising today the position that China takes against Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those criticisms which I levelled against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in adjournment debates early in the morning, I level now against China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will be one of those expendable targets because it has upon its soil at the present time a number of <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases which are aimed at monitoring the strength of the USSR and of the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are paranoic in their fear of an encirclement of their nation, of their people, by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, by the People’s Republic of China and all the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that emerged from that revolution was the cancellation of armament contracts with <span class="highlight">United States</span>, France and the United Kingdom worth billions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the industrialists and the armament makers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, France and the United Kingdom benefited greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were betrayed by the British in the agreements that were made, and they fought again- this time the French again and subsequently the full forces of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should amend that, because the <span class="highlight">United States</span> could not bring to bear the massive armaments it had at its disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having defeated the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Vietnamese people set themselves a program of reunification and economic recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  has already explained how that was frustrated by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, by countries such as Australia supporting the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and by the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wanted the <span class="highlight">United States</span> influence to remain in that area as a counterbalance to Soviet influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the Soviet Union did not believe that the Vietnamese could succeed and, as is now history, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> folded before that last assault and the Vietnamese were victorious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had assisted in reconstruction and if Australia had supported it in doing so, Vietnam would possibly have reached an independent position, but it was not allowed to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> also is engaged in the same dangerous exercise of encouraging China and is taking sides against the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the lack of interest in the Parliament and in the media, the fact that in the past we have felt secure in view of our geographic isolation and that we considered ourselves under the protective umbrella of the United Kingdom or the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Australia has had little interest in or knowledge of world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister establish whether Telecom has given consideration to installing vandal-proof telephones of the sort widely used in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In September 1978, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Health, Education and Welfare published a report which stated that 40 per cent of all cancer deaths in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were due to exposure to occupational carcinogens such as asbestos, uranium, benzine, nickel oxide, chromium and petroleum factions, to mention just a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the AttorneyGeneral noted a recent <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court decision which waived alimony awarded in a divorce case on the ground that the male appellant would be suffering sex discrimination if his wealthy wife were to receive maintenance from him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I really do not have any information except that I have heard some vague rumour about the decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court to which  Senator Messner  refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the law applicable to a situation of this kind in Australia is, of course, not determined by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court but by the Family Law Act passed by this Parliament and interpreted by the Family Court of Australia or ultimately the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress report of 26 April 1978- hardly a year old- deals with three particular aspects, namely, safety, costs and jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing with the question of safety, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress says that there is still no demonstrated technology for permanently and safely disposing of this waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of a telex message sent this morning in which a Health Department spokesman in Brisbane expressed anger about the slowness of the National Health and Medical Research Council in getting the facts on the Alsea incident which has led to additional restrictions being placed on the use of 2,4,5-T in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a continuing sensitive and unstable export market which continues to be influenced to a large degree by the policies of support prices, and subsidies for exports to the European Economic Community and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, it is particularly important for the domestic market to be maintained and indeed to be developed, as  Senator Lewis  indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of this situation, and the concern expressed in business, political and other circles in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as to the decision of the Australian Government, can the Minister indicate whether the deadline to which he referred, and the appointment of an independent arbitrator with respect to compensation, might be reconsidered by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we have a situation where the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has taken a position, concerned as it is with the state of health of those who may be affected by this chemical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, there is enough evidence, surely from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> conclusion, to say that until we are reasonably sure that there is no problem then that conclusion ought to apply so far as Australia is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the period 15 January 1979 to 5 February 1979, the Director-General of the Department of Social Security visited the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Yugoslavia and Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that the report of studies on 2,4,5-T, which claimed a possible linkage with high miscarriages and perhaps the ill health suggested by  Senator Missen,  has been received from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- In May 1978 honourable senators were informed that when a formal <span class="highlight">United States</span> proposal was placed before the Government to install a replacement satellite ground terminal at the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station, it would be considered on its merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A formal <span class="highlight">United States</span> proposal was received on 17 February 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepts that a need exists for the communication equipment at Harold E. Holt to be sustained at levels of technical performance fully compatible with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defense Communication System of which it forms an integral element. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this transmission and reception would be done by the MSC61 through the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defense Satellite Communication System of which it, like the TSC54 terminal would be a part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the fact of the matter was that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had decided to install the terminal and had called for contracts for its installation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Cabinet directed the Foreign Affairs Minister to express its concern to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador and complaints were made at an official level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At that time, the then Minister for Defence,  Mr Barnard,  and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Defence Secretary Schlesinger, stated that the Australian Government would have full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time the issue was being debated a series of Press reports indicated that the new system being constructed at North West Cape will substantially upgrade the <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence satellite communications system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The history of this matter would indicate that he has very little idea of the overall plans of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for the base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we successfully negotiated a different agreement with the Americans which ensured that Australia’s rights were safeguarded and, above all, that any intentions on the part of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to alter that base would be conveyed to the Australian Government before action was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not been good in Germany and it was not good in the past in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, with an organisation such as the Central Intelligence Agency, certainly until the procedures for the control and review of that agency were overhauled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his submissions to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> investigation of the activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation he indicated that FBI investigations should be authorised only on the basis of information or allegation that an individual or individuals acting in concert may be engaged in:  activities which involve or will involve the use of force or violence and the violation of federal law for one of five designated (criminal) purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly true that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the point of almost no return was faced as far as the Central Investigation Agency or the Federal Bureau of Investigation were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Richard Hall’s book  The Secret State  on Australia’s spy industry there is considerable discussion on the nature of the relationship between ASIO and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> did take seriously Australian security lapses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to understand that although relationships with Great Britain or the <span class="highlight">United States</span> might be an important and significant part of the work of ASIO they are in fact subsidiary to the protection of Australian interests and the extent to which one gets information from overseas or the extent to which one provides information to people overseas can be judged only by the criteria of what is necessary in the defence of Australia and in the defence of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we all know, the lack of financial control and accountability has been enormously important in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in allowing the Central Intelligence Agency to run amok as it did for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 Australian Law Reform Commission report on Criminal Investigation to which  Senator Button  has already referred, a calculation was done based on <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience of the effect that the 107 telephone tappings that had taken place in 1973 in this country would have had so far as the number of people caught up by such telephone tappings are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The calculation that the Law Reform Commission came up with was that applying the sort of ratio of the number of conversations and the number of people overheard to each tap, based on <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience and bearing in mind that the Act authorises and most taps stay on for periods of up to six months, that number of taps in 1973- telephone alone, nothing to do with listening devices and so on- may have resulted in as many as 12,000 different people being overheard having as many as 68,000 different conversations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America where all the scrutiny which is available to the members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate, the members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> House of Representatives and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> courts has been unable to prevent completely improper conduct both by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by the Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly think that there are a number of people who have their own reasons and quite dishonest reasons for alleging that they did, but the fact remains- and it is quite evident and everybody knows it- that a large number of instances particularly during the administration of President Nixon, but not only during that administration, the FBI and the CIA were used for completely improper purposes and sometimes without the knowledge of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to go into it now but from some recent experiences I have been having, I am not entirely sure that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Freedom of Information Act is quite as effective as some of its enthusiastic admirers might believe, well intentioned though it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that there were many people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America who would have said that it would have been impossible that the CIA or the FBI would have done the things that it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress has endeavoured through measures such as the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has been doing a great deal of work and spending a great deal of money on this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is quite clear is that where agreements have been concluded, as they have been with respect to the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, there has been a vast benefit to the travelling public and a consequential great increase in the number of bookings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On reading the <span class="highlight">United States</span> 1979  Master Tax Guide,  the situation which apparently exists in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> seems to be somewhat different from the Australian position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a citizen can contribute any amount, large or small, to a charitable institution within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and can claim it as a tax deduction provided that in any one income year the cumulative contribution does not exceed 50 per cent of what is described as his ‘adjusted gross income’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The arrangement in Canada is similar to that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been reinforced in this view by the recent comments of Admiral Zumwalt, the former chief of naval operations for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that until recently the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy did not depend on this type of craft although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy is now developing a class of 340-tonne hydrofoils, each of which will carry eight Harpoon ship-to-ship missiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee obtained evidence from  Dr Hoffman  that <span class="highlight">United States</span> and English studies on the relationship; between tyre failure and accidents do not show a consistent pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The price in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was 1 5c a litre, in Sweden 30c, in Spain 32c, in West Germany 34c, in Austria 35c, in Switzerland 36c, in Denmark 37c, in the Netherlands 38.9c, in France 40c and in Italy 48c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to comparative costs between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and note that, probably because of the remoteness of the areas in which drilling has taken place in Australia- which adds to the costs and risks- compared with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, on-shore in Australia in 1975 the cost of drilling per metre was some $609 whereas in America the cost per metre was $274. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The business brains behind this company which runs a multi-million dollar chain of hospitals for profit throughout the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and throughout the world was a  Mr Massey  who built the Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation empire into the world ‘s largest commercial prepared food organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- we could shift the commitment of our money, cash flow and reinvestment from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also drew attention to the fact that Australia ranks only second behind the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in terms of the number of television sets per 100 people in the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quoted from a <span class="highlight">United States</span> report entitled ‘Television and Growing Up’ which stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was therefore not surprised at the cover story of  Time  magazine of 12 March 1979 which dealt with the relative profits and policies pursued by the three mammoth <span class="highlight">United States</span> commercial television stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report deals with the American Broadcasting Company, the American ABC, which is by far and away the most successful of the commercial broadcasting organisations in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a recent issue of  Time  magazine one could read some more disturbing news about a new film called  The Warriors  which has been released by Paramount Pictures in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, attention was drawn to it in the report of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Surgeon General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, at a lower level, the Minister would know of the case of an Australian on a serious narcotics charge who was given back his passport as he was granted an adjournment of his case to enable him to go to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> on a business commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HCAs S45m hospital acquisition and development project in Australia is pan of the company’s plan to develop foreign markets in case the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and State governments apply controls which severely limit the profitability of domestic hospital operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government is taking very close notice and cognisance of the expansion of these profiteering hospitals and there is a possibility that it will do something to control them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the same firm as is seeking to expand in Australia because it foresees increasing government regulations in its home base in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If down the road a moratorium were put on building hospitals in this country - meaning the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- we could shift the commitment of our money, cash flow and reinvestment from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its rapid expansion outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> into foreign markets it expects to double its size in five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently over half of its revenue in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> came from Medicare Medicaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its pre-tax profit margins were about 8 per cent of revenues for <span class="highlight">United States</span> hospitals, 1 6 per cent for foreign hospitals and 1 3 per cent for established health care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the cost escalation which was part of the agreement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and which I will come to, if the honourable senator will bear with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, I point out- especially for  Senator Knight’s  benefit- as I did on the last occasion, that under the memorandum of arrangements between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Australia, the Australian Government is entitled to information on costs on a continuing basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would refer any honourable senators to the evidence that was given on this very point by experts in this area before the Armed Services Committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would not be so bad if the costs of the vessels were an average cost spread over the whole purchase of this type of vessel for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If our vessels are being built by a less efficient yard under contract to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and by a corporation which is in some financial difficulty, it is logical to assume that our ships are to cost more than the unit cost of a vessel being built for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> fleet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The patrol frigates were designed for very specific purposes under the concept promoted by Admiral Zumwalt, a former Chief of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the following recent developments in the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, as reported to me, may be of interest to the honourable senator <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">United States</span> of America- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  left Australia yesterday to undertake discussions in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, does the Minister not agree that this is a matter on which the Federal Government could be of assistance to State governments in view of the present pressing economic crisis that faces Australia, as it does the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has this cult recently been involved in an organised campaign in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to harass law enforcement agencies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some information that the Church of Scientology has been involved in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in campaigns to criticise <span class="highlight">United States</span> law enforcement agencies and their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refers to the submissions made based upon the Freedom of Information Act in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and he points out that even under that Act many of the records of ASIO would be confidential information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when the citizens and the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are concerning themselves with an investigation into one of their own secret organisations- the Central Intelligence Agency- in relation to the pruning of some of its powers, we have the Government of this country being prepared to give a similar organisation greater powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it entered the Cold War era, some things went wrong, although the <span class="highlight">United States</span> media had to accept some responsibility for what happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the use of 2,4,5-T in controlling many of our noxious weeds, particularly in open pasture conditions, but more importantly its exclusive ability to control brigalow regrowth, which of course is of great significance in central Qld, has our National Health and Medical Research Council been able to justify reports from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> America on the supposed deleterious effect of this weedicide on human life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  I know that you will note that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at no time banned use of 2,4,5-T, for instance, in open range country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned last week that a working party of the National Health and Medical Research Council would be looking at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> report, and my advice is that the ad hoc committee of the Council on the use and safety of 2,4,5-T met in Adelaide on 23 March to formulate a report to the Council on the current position with regard to this herbicide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides reviewing its past conclusions and the scientific reports which had since become available, this meeting specifically examined the documents from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America which contained details of the action taken by the environmental protection agency in that country to suspend registration of the herbicide for certain applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also noted evidence and a number of specific documents which had been received from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and which formed the basis of several emergency suspensions of the distribution, sale and use of 2,4,5-T for forestry areas, right-of-ways and pastures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether the Government is aware that one of the American investor owned chains of private hospitals seeking to take the place of public hospitals in Australia is in a list of 53 companies which made disclosures to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that they had either made foreign pay-offs or were investigating to determine whether they had made foreign pay-offs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen reports that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee has supported the sending of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> observer team to Rhodesia for the elections of 20 April? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he also seen reports that  Sir Harold  Wilson, the former British Prime Minister, stated in an international television interview that Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should recognise the new government in Rhodesia following the elections, provided they are satisfied that the result reflects the wishes of the majority of black and white Rhodesians, and that Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should send official observers to the elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of reported statements by the former British Prime Minister,  Sir Harold  Wilson, that, provided they were satisfied that the results of the forthcoming election in Rhodesia reflect the wishes of the majority of black and white Rhodesians, Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should recognise the postelection government and that Britain, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and independent black African states should send observers to the elections in April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage no Western governments, including Britain and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, have advocated sending official observers to monitor the Rhodesian elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Secretary of State,  Mr Vance,  issued a similar statement the same day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likely, however, that a number of British members of parliament and members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress will observe the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government therefore supports the continuing efforts of the United Kingdom and <span class="highlight">United States</span> governments to bring all parties together to discuss a settlement within the framework of the Anglo-American proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Science and the Environment read the report from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities on the use of 2,4,5-T in Oregon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government concerned that despite the actions of authorities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the National Health and Medical Research Committee in Australia has advised the Government that there is insufficient evidence to warrant withdrawal of the herbicide 2,4,5-T even if only as a precaution until Australian authorities can carry out their own research? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister has not done so already, will he read the findings of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Environmental Protection Agency that led to the bans on 2,4,5-T in March 1979? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read the <span class="highlight">United States</span> report and noted what it said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Government has acted in a proper way to obtain the information from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and to have the best of our brains in Australia evaluate that and other reports that have come through in relation to 2,4,5-T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information which I gave the Senate earlier indicated that a working party of the National Health and Medical Research Council devoted its time to this issue on 23 March and made an evaluation of all the information which had come forward, including the <span class="highlight">United States</span> report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent action of the Environmental Protection Agency in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in restricting the use of 2,4,5-T had led to the matter of the use and safety of 2,4,5-T being again referred to Council for advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular a special working party of Council had investigated in detail the material on which the actions of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Environmental Protection Agency were based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perhaps ironic, as part of the inconsistency of the Minister for Defence, that the Government is presently maintaining in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, what could only be described as a small army of defence officials supposedly responsible for the review of defence purchases and equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when the Minister for Defence has had a number of overseas tours reviewing possible purchases in Great Britain and Europe, it seems strange that is is necessary to have such a large contingent for this purpose in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> employed full time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consideration should be given to the repeal of the Whaling Act 1960 and its replacement by new legislation directed to the protection of cetacea, and if thought desirable other marine mammals, along the lines of the marine mammal protection legislation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the  Bulletin  of 28 February of this year, under the heading ‘The marvellous bean that will save the whale’, there is a lengthy discussion about the development of the jojoba bean, which is a native of some very dry climates, particularly the south-west of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Mexico, and which is now being grown in commercial quantities in Mexico, the southwest of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Negev Desert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went on to say that it would be possible for Australia, if it wished, to indicate after a two-year adjustment period that the importation of sperm oil, spermaceti and other whale products would be prohibited as has already occurred in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the  Audubon  magazine of January 1977 it is clearly indicated that implementation of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> 200-mile fisheries limit next summer will deal a crippling blow to the north Pacific, Japanese and Soviet whaling fleets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I summarise the principal recommendations as follows: That Australia should oppose the continuance of whaling; that whaling by other nations should be prohibited within the Australian 200-mile fishing zone; that consideration should be given to the repeal of the Whaling Act 1960 and its replacement with legislation better able to protect all forms of marine mammal along <span class="highlight">United States</span> lines; that the importation of whale products or goods containing whale products should be banned in Australia from 1 January 1981; that Australia should seek to achieve a world wide ban on whaling; that both in its planning and in international discussions on the management of marine resources Australia should ensure that any implications for whales are given serious consideration; and that the Commonwealth Government should promote research on whales by Australian scientists and research institutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expenditure of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is approximately $50m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think the question asked was whether the Commonwealth Government has introduced a scheme similar to the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that I should refer the question to the Minister for National Development to get a more detailed answer for  Senator Bishop;  for instance, information on the nature of the technology of the plant in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am suggesting also that we must get away from our chauvinistic attitude that only medical graduates of Australia, the United Kingdom and some odd universities in the world are considered satisfactory medical practitioners in this country and others are excluded because they come from such undistinguished medical schools as Vienna and other leading medical schools in Italy, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent American Freedom of Information Act, the Church report and the Pike report all show the direction which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is taking to deal with this very question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The public ventilation of the abuses in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in the reports to which I have referred has contributed to a curbing of the oppressive powers of organisations such as the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the practice in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America; but, fortunately, the legislative arm and public opinion in that country have brought about a sufficient change in attitudes to lead the American Congress to exercise some control over the activities of its intelligence organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In looking at security organisations and the people who really make the decisions for our society, the only experience I can draw upon, in addition to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience, is what happened in Europe prior to World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such evidence as is available- it is neither overwhelming nor compelling; we are dealing with a clandestine organisation about whose operations we can get only a glimpse- is sufficient to show that it ought to be investigated in the same way as, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Church Committee has examined the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely no one will suggest that  Senator Church, Mr Pike  and the other members of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress who have been involved in the public scrutiny of these organisations have improper motivations, or that they are actuated by any but the highest ideals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will leave honourable senators with this happy thought: I have noticed that in the past the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America often sent a couple of parliamentarians to these IWC meetings to watch <span class="highlight">United States</span> interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of speakers have said that  Mr Justice  Hope did not appear to have advanced very much reason for using that criterion or definition, but one can find this if one examines Volume 2 of the fourth report, and looks at the draft submission of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Justice and the testimony of the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a study of some 35,000 workers at the Hannaford nuclear facility in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- this was the first careful study ever carried out on workers in the industry- it was established that there is an increasing incidence of leukaemia, bone marrow cancer and lung cancer amongst the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Question Time, in first reading debates and by way of questions on notice, I have tried, to no avail, to elicit some information from the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  relating to the intrusion of the largest hospital corporation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the Hospital Corporation of America, into the acquisition of a chain of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why can he not supply the Senate, the Parliament and the people of Australia with reasons for his reticence in answering these questions when the track form of this organisation in other parts of the world is such that it is using methods not tolerable in this country to intrude into other countries outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> had an inflation of 10 per cent for most of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has opened the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to a tremendous influx of beef to keep domestic prices down simply because- I remind  Senator Baume  of this- a presidential election is coming up and he wants to keep his cost structure down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that as soon as this presidential election is over we will be in a situation in which, because of the powerful <span class="highlight">United States</span> lobby, many of these beef markets could be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: As the Christian League of Southern Africa, which was set up to conduct this campaign, plans to open offices in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Britain, has our Government any knowledge of plans to extend this campaign or to open an office in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that dental film of sensitivity lower than speed Group D is no longer being manufactured in or imported for use into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or other countries for use because of the established high level of patient exposure and the subsequent risk to patients’ health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Question Time today I reminded honourable senators that the Government was proceeding with its interest rate policies, whereas the governments of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Great Britain had policies which had resulted in significant increases in interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also has to be concerned about how the DirectorGeneral himself might be tempted to use such information, not given the character and antecedents of the present Director-General but certainly given what we have been inclined to fear about Directors-General in the past and what we know about the track record of people such as Hoover in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as he said that we should show caution in this matter, did he really mean caution or did he mean procrastination until such time as the Government has discovered what is the policy of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration on this question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It thus appears that breast cancer incidence in Australia is a little lower than that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A., and Hade R.

    <p>Is the Minister aware that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the direct cost of selling stamps is 1 7c from each dollar received from the sale of stamps? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister able to say whether the cost of selling stamps in Australia is comparable with that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America the direct cost of selling stamps is 1 7c in the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One such safeguard that ought to be mentioned specifically, because it has occasioned a degree of public comment, is that the warrants that are to be issued to enable the exercise of these powers should not be granted by the Minister, but rather by a court, as is the situation by and large in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in the  Public Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 1968,  which is the omnibus legislation governing most of these provisions, in the discussion of that particular public law, under Title III entitled  Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance,  section 801 (c) reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ratio of persons and conversations to wire-taps, if indeed accurate for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, may, it is conceded, in fact be wildly astray for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I say that is the well established and accepted argument, certainly in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that the implications of the use of these powers go primarily to the chilling effect that their use has on the political activity which is essential to the workings of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The stipulation that the sale was subject to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government’s indicating its concurrence was a condition of the original government to government agreement covering the initial purchase of the aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the Environment aware of the report published in the  Age  on Friday last released by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Academy of Scientists which concluded that there was no known threshold below which radiation ceased to have adverse effects on human beings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what the honourable senator mentions is something that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> National Academy of Scientists is criticising, I accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was a letter also sent to the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> asking him to intervene? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have seen reports that on behalf of these people somebody wrote to the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said on a number of occasions in the course of this debate that in preparing new legislation in relation to a security organisation in Australia we have a unique opportunity to benefit from the experiences of the past in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Germany, the United Kingdom and, indeed, in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the hope of encouraging some economic independence from the Soviet Union and Vietnam, will the Minister also urge the Government to provide whatever aid is possible to Laos for the development of its untapped resources and to request other Western nations, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, to do likewise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Minister seen the report that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal Trade Commission has recommended that all television advertising aimed at children under the age of eight be banned, and that all television advertising of presweetened and artificially sweetened products aimed at children under the age of 12 be banned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, instruct Telecom to provide this service to subscribers in areas where it has this equipment installed, so that some Australian subscribers may enjoy a service which private enterprise has supplied to subscribers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America for many years and which, if provided, would go a long way towards dispelling the public disquiet about Telecom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think will be readily understood, these requests have come particularly from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, where there is also a widespread and growing public concern about televisions impact on children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable Senators will be aware that the prime purpose of this overseas visit was to finalise important bilateral negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time table for the formal finalization of the MTN is linked to <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congressional examination and approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bilateral agreements which have been concluded with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan are an important part of the overall MTN package for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And well over half of our beef exports are marketed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan where there have always been strong protectionist pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the following year the <span class="highlight">United States</span> imposed restraints on imports at a level significantly below that of the immediately preceding years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our two major beef markets of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan we have negotiated access commitments of at least 380,000 tonnes a year- or almost a third higher than our actual exports in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreements just concluded with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan will guard against a return to this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The settlement concluded with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is particularly significant and I would like to give the Senate more details of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1964 the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has had legislation to restrict imports of beef by means of quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have never had any continuing formal understanding with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> as to a minimum or floor level for those quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when protectionist pressures were increasing in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> this was a matter of particular concern to the Australian beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we have received renewed assurances that the attitude of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration towards any new countercyclical meat import legislation is unchanged from that announced in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The MTN arrangements reached with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have also achieved most useful concessions on a range of other products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After generations of effort on the part of successive Governments we have at last succeeded in negotiating a reduction in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> duty on raw wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the maximum reduction which, under their legislation, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> negotiators were authorised to make, and over the shortest period permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we have not achieved all our objectives in the MTN, I am satisfied that the bilateral settlements reached with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan are fair to both sides and will facilitate an expansion of trade on a mutuallyadvantageous basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were able to impress upon  Dr Schlesinger  and other senior U.S. officials Australia’s potential as a stable supplier of LNG and have suggested further detailed discussions at official level aimed at enhancing Australia’s opportunity to supply natural gas to the West Coast of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that, even if the current world oil supply situation can be brought into balance in a relatively short time, the future economic growth of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- and therefore of the Western worlddepends upon developments aimed at producing energy as economically as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally I attach particular importance to the MTN settlements reached with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sure they will be of lasting economic value to Australia and will help underpin the broader bonds of friendship which exist between the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Japan and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last October  Mr Sinclair,  the Minister for Primary Industry, when under the hammer in the House of Representatives, suddenly took off to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, his excuse being the Bill that was then before the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In January the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  returned from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> after one of his world tours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anthony  went off to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> last March and sent a message from Washington on 30 March which said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, of course, we have this statement which is, in fact, a rehash and an exaggeration of all the previous boasts and bragging by assortments of globetrotting Ministers about what they have allegedly achieved with access, particularly for beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the American market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads between the lines of the statement and if one reads other statements that have come from the Government, it has been admitted that the threat of counter-cyclical legislation with respect to Australian beef exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> still hangs over the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has somewhat dishonestly presented some figures relating to exports of Australian beef to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan in past years and in this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our two major beef markets of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan we have negotiated access commitments of at least 380,000 tonnes a year- or almost a third higher than our actual exports in 1 974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan during 1974, we find that 268,000 tonnes were exported and that 380,000 tonnes does almost represent a 50 per cent increase on that figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one cares to look at the Minister’s statement more closely, one finds that all of these conditions are subject to ratification by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress in accordance with its normal procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one could and ought to add that there is no absolute guarantee or even a virtual guarantee, to use the Minister’s selfcontradictory terminology, that at some future time the <span class="highlight">United States</span> administration may not change its policy on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the glib assurance which  Mr Anthony  gave towards the end of 1967, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not ratified the International Sugar Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anthony  makes no comment whether the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is going to ratify the International Sugar Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superficially that sounds significant until we recognise that Australia has exported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> over recent years only about 100,000 bales of wool and that the total duty levelled on those quite small exports of wool amounts to approximately $5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly,  Mr Anthony  says nothing about whether the natural gas which  Sir Charles  Court at least hopes to sell off to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> will be accepted by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, sales of natural gas to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or the future development of the North West Shelf gasfields almost certainly depends on whether sales can be made to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ware is saying there; and his comment is correct; that what we have been guaranteed is 75 per cent of the present level of exports to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth noting that what we have virtually been guaranteed, to use the Minister’s phrase, is a level of imports of Australian beef significantly lower than the levels actually imported from Australia by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> during the slump years of 1975, 1976 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement would set the stage for the introduction of a counter-cyclical import system in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> pointing to Australia’s agreement on a base figure as justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders why the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  is not ducking off to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> again to do a bit of grandstanding, to save the Australian beef industry from the threat of counter-cyclical legislation, as he alleges he did last October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition in the House of Representatives started talking about the Finnane report, again we would find him ducking off to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering the Australian Government last year saw fit to lobby hard against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress’ passing of a counter-cyclical Bill this would seem inconsistent with previous policy . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have to show as a result of four junketeering visits to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by senior Ministers of this Government is this document which has been placed before us and which is a piece of political grandstanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regretably, in Australia we just had no machinery anything like as sophisticated as the uniformity machinery which has been established and has long existed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Canada- two similar federal systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that all honourable senators have read about the history of Harry Bridges and the ordeal which he went through before he obtained citizenship of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Opposition has moved these two amendments which together provide for a proper system of financial accountability, a condition which one would have thought would have been beyond argument, given the experience in particular in recent years in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in relation to the activities and operations of both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose extravagant misbehaviour very often has been attributed in the past to the quite uncontrolled way in which particular budgets or sections of budgets were able to be voted and spent by those organisations without any effective kind of congressional or other oversight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kind of oversight that the Opposition is seeking to provide in these amendments is not a congressional or parliamentary oversight in the way that operates in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or in our own system in respect of other departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience and everything else have shown us the importance of that principle being observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at the figures over the five or six years for which they were made available, they could say that, contrary to the views of those people who are totally opposed to the existence of ASIO as an organisation, it is quite clear that the Organisation is not going mad in terms of the number of warrants that have been issued as is the Central Intelligence Agency, for example, which appeared to be going mad in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sunset legislation in this country and even in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is still very much an experiment, although, in many ways, it is a very valuable experiment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find grave difficulty- having heard the arguments advanced by  Senator Missen  in favour of what, in some circumstances, one might justifiably describe as this trendy aberration from the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- in understanding how he can vote on and oppose a number of Opposition amendments to various clauses of this Bill on the grounds of practicality, and then suggest this provision as one which he would otherwise regard as being practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the case that the Government of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has made a decision to take up or espouse the Dillingham case before the International Court of Justice, and accordingly to sue Australia in that forum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this decision, if it has been made, not represent a spectacular failure of  Mr Peacock’s  attempts at diplomacy in that area, and make nonsense of any claim of a special relationship with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is interesting that a question raised in Canada, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Britain and other places has been: Can government govern itself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I produced and tabled in the Senate no so long ago, figures showing the comparative situations in regard to cents per kilometre flown in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, Europe and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures show that the normal economy fares of Australia’s domestic airline services are comparable with those of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That could be done through a plan which was developed by Louis Kelso in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and which is operating successfully in a large number of cases in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in other countries the practice is to open up the skies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Korea, new assessments of the north’s military strength have placed this at a significantly higher level than had previously been estimated, and concern over security in the Korean Peninsula has led to adoption of a longer time scale for <span class="highlight">United States</span> ground troop withdrawals from the Republic of Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of the fact that the figures he has given indicate that our per capita level of imports from developing countries is high compared with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, the European Economic Community or Japan, it is pertinent to note that it is in the most sensitive areas, such as textiles, timber, white goods and small electrical goods, that we have adopted policies which are as restrictive as those of EEC and some other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand from  Dr Boden  of the Department that representatives of the States had to submit a report to the Department on the kangaroo population in their States and whether they thought the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government should through its Department of the Interior support a limited export of our kangaroo products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to people like  Senator Maunsell  who say that there are plenty of kangaroos: ‘Do not forget that in the 1929 era  President  Hoover of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, who might have had his minuses in the economic field, refused to allow Australian possums into the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it also a fact that the Royal Air Force VIP Boeings will become too noisy for civil airfields in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America from I January 1 985 and that after 1 985 they would not be allowed to operate in Australia either if they were not RAAF registered and thus not subject to civil aviation regulations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, lt refers to the death in Melbourne recently of a 32-year-old Telecom technician whose death was diagnosed by a <span class="highlight">United States</span> agency as being due to legionnaires disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress passes the Ways and Means Committee’s recommendation that <span class="highlight">United States</span> beef imports be restricted to 1.2 billion lb, does this mean that the Multilateral Trade Negotiations agreement entered into by  Mr Anthony  and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration will have to be renegotiated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the question is as follows: The Government was most concerned to hear last Friday that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress Ways and Means Committee on 3 1 May recommended a counter-cyclical meat import Bill providing for a floor on meat imports of 1.2 billion lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  only recently concluded Multilateral Trade Negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in which he received renewed assurances from the Administration that, as in 1 978 with similar legislation, its position would be that any such legislation must contain an access level for meat imports of at least 1.3 billion lb annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has pointed out that the adoption of a floor at a lower level could have serious implications for our MTN settlement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem clear that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration did accept a law which involved such a substantial change in a major element of our MTN settlement, Australia would be forced to look carefully at the whole package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regulatory and safeguards measures should be undertaken by and be the responsibility of an absolutely independent authority, as is the case in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the United Kingdom and in any nation to which Australia would look for models of the best organisational structure for this peculiarly hazardous industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quoting the best source I can get- we are awaiting the results of the full inquiry in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America- and my information at this stage is that the radiation fall-out, and there was some around Harrisburg was said to be something like the equivalent of two chest x-rays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the incident at Three Mile Island in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where it was substantiated that it was not purely human error but also the unexpected functioning of the equipment in the reactor that caused the problem, one wonders how on earth a country could go ahead and build a nuclear reactor in an area which can be affected by earthquakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As John Aherne, a senior aide to Energy Secretary Schlesinger, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told in the article that  Dr Wagoner  is angry at the way in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has dealt with uranium mining and uranium miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America generates 13 per cent of all its power from nuclear sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no way that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> can suddenly overnight withdraw 13 per cent of its power segment which comes from nuclear sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the loss of overseas forward naval bases by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in recent times and the vulnerability of its island base in the north Indian Ocean, would the Government favourably support the establishment of a <span class="highlight">United States</span> naval base in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas the <span class="highlight">United States</span> legal system has been manipulated by <span class="highlight">United States</span> consumers in order to achieve benefits for those consuming these energy resources within the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, that manipulation is now being confronted by an Australian government which at last, somewhat belatedly, has recognised its obligation to ensure that Australian producers, whether of energy resources, iron ore, bauxite or alumina, et cetera, can themselves present a united front to the united buying power of groups abroad, of which <span class="highlight">United States</span> utility companies and Japanese steel companies are perhaps the best known examples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just a few hours ago the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America announced that, in spite of the recent elections in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would not recognise that country, nor would it take off the international sanctions imposed on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In response, it advised the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government that, while it did not agree to a <span class="highlight">United States</span> proposal to refer the matter to arbitration, if the matter were to be referred by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the International Court of Justice, Australia would not insist on the normal requirement that Dillingham Corporation first exhaust any legal remedies in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might bc noted, however, that the Canadian position has been greatly influenced by the proximity of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the strength of competition from advertising agencies and suppliers based in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister realise that in countries such as Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, where there are a great many more cars than in Australia, cars are allowed to turn to the right through a red traffic light after coming to a stop if the way is clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we examine the experiences of other countries- I think we have had some examples of this in recent times- we will see grave breaches of human rights, of the rights of citizens and of the rights of proper procedures and practices in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America by the Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate has insisted upon in its deliberations on the operations of its intelligence organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end of the world did not come in respect of our relations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and there is absolutely no evidence, except in the thinking processes of this Government or of the intelligence organisations, that these sorts of consequences would flow from any attempt by the elected representatives of the Australian people to exercise some surveillance, some control and some influence over what we on this side of the House believe ought to be the correct and responsible role of the legislator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem certain that the incidence of heroin addiction in a city in Australia at this time is higher than in any corresponding city of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have mentioned this to health investigators and narcotics investigators, and a cross-section of sociologists who have studied the problem both here and in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean to say that we are less healthy than the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, because in that country there now seems to be a turn away from narcotics to other forms of drugs, particularly alcohol; but, in terms of heroin addiction, that is the information that I have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Law Reform Commission has estimated, based on the application to those figures of what we know about the <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience, that this may have already created a situation in which as many as 12,000 different Australians, engaging in as many as 68,000 or 75,000 different conversations, are being overheard each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the somewhat simplistic belief that harsher penalties are the answer to the considerable drug problem in Australia in fact will turn out to be as ill-founded in Australia as it has been in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is common to believe that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America has an essentially liberal system of dealing with penalties and with narcotic offences in general compared with countries such as Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an article by Eugene Dolescha in a journal called  Crime and Delinquency  it was pointed out that, in fact, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is one of the most punitive of all the free nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The author says:  the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had an imprisonment rate of 244 per 100,000 population, the highest in the free world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we compare the <span class="highlight">United States</span> with countries that are known to have the most advanced and most humane criminal justice systems in the world, the differences are striking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps useful to look specifically at the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the experience of that country in dealing with the drug problems by the sheer imposition of harsher penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has an executive government, and I am not suggesting that this Senate is in a position to direct the activities of a Minister, whether it is my party or those of honourable senators opposite which is in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For three or four years they filled their quota into the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but for the next five years the quota was not filled, and an argument developed over whether the quota should be transferred to the Poles or some other group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This figure is higher than we would like and higher than we believed at this time last year it would be; but we all know what has happened since … On an annualised basis, inflation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is now running at around 14 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making this point, may I note in passing that this distinction between taxation and criminal laws generally is one that has appealed very much to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Supreme Court, where retroactive taxation laws in fact have been upheld on a number of occasions as not unconstitutional or not otherwise bad in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure of the Government’s trade negotiations was exposed in the most dramatic way in a report on the front page of last Saturday’s  Age  regarding the outcome of last week ‘s discussions with <span class="highlight">United States</span> officials in Canberra on beef quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other things it was reported that we have won from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a firm commitment to import at lest 590 million kilograms of beef a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report also stated that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> delegation involved in the Canberra talks refused to alter the proposed counter-cyclical legislation but Australia did not expect to win such a concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not propose, and I have not time, to review the whole three years of that propaganda exercise, but I would like to start at last December with the return of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  from his post-Christmas but pre-Boeing trip to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> when he boasted that he had won new access to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> beef market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commenting on the multilateral trade negotiation talks, he said that he was satisfied from discussions with  Mr Bergland  that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administrative was firmly committed to a base import level of 1.3 billion lbs, which, incidentally, is 590 million kilograms, the figure that was mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For Australia, possibly the most significant part of the settlement with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> involves guarantees covering US imports of beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Even back in Australia, some months later,  Mr Anthony  continued to boast about his alleged achievements in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> beef market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As from January the 1st next year, duty on imported tobacco will be reduced by 60 per cent following the multilateral trade negotiations between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which gave a 60 per cent drop in the US wool levy and guaranteed exports of beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is highly significant that there was no ministerial announcement that this concession had actually been implemented for the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What, in fact, the Government is doing is offering an industry to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> without insisting on any trade-off at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that it is an accepted fact that counter-cyclical legislation will be approved by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress and Administration there are no hastily-arranged dramatic flights to Washington such as we saw last October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this matter we are not just concerned with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and beef markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have won from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> a firm commitment to import at least 590 million kilograms of beef a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government dismantled the growth formulas of the export incentive scheme, one of the major incentives for export trade; it presided over the shutout of Australia from one of our major traditional markets, the European Economic Community; and it was also in power during the disastrous shut-outs of beef from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan in 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, that Government made no approach at all to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for an access commitment when that tragedy hit the beef industry in 1974and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer not only to the special trade negotiations with the European Economic Community- I will deal with some of the positive benefits that have come from those later- but also to the bilateral negotiations and bilateral agreements with a number of other countries, particularly the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, Japan and the Middle East countries, including Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Walsh commenced his remarks by saying that the negotiations with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> had been a failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, what we have got from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a firm general agreement on tariffs and trade type commitment to a minimal global level of imports of 1.2 billion tonnes of beef of which 5 1 per cent will come from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has the right to adjust the overall settlement if <span class="highlight">United States</span> imports fall below 1.3 billion lb in the event of counter cyclical measures being introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, a problem could arise in the event of counter cyclical legislation coming into force in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> but that would not affect the basic allocation or commitment of 1.2 billion tonnes which I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that unfortunately efforts made to obtain congressional approval of legislation that would enable the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to particiate fully in the International Sugar Agreement have been proceeding now for in excess of a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Although there appears to be no real opposition within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the international legislation, it has become tied to other legislation for the implementation of a new domestic sugar policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further disturbing factor is that the European Economic Community has indicated that it has no intention of joining in the Agreement until the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has ratified it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the great concern of the Australian sugar industry at the delay in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ratification, I understand that the  chairman  of the Queensland Sugar Board,  Mr Lloyd  Harris, will be visiting Washington next week to have discussions with the Australian Embassy and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> officials and congressmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat: Australia, which some 5 years ago was costed out of world markets by the previous Labor Government and was put into the bracket of the top inflation nations of the Western world, is now costed back into world markets and is now in a very good competitive position compared with other countries, notably our main competitors, such as the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that a number of drug control authorities throughout the world have refused to endorse such a use of the drug and, specifically, that the Food and Drug Administration of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> refused to endorse it after its attention had been drawn to the fact that the drug was associated with cancer, temporary or permanent involuntary chemical sterility and birth defects in children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development seen a report of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Department of Energy, which states that energy consumption by American industry will be 13 to 17 per cent less per unit of output in 1980 than it was in 1 972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is able to make energy savings of that substantial character, it is certainly a major development and it would have major effects on the worldwide energy supply situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to this morning’s Press report concerning the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s ordering the immediate closure of an atomic fuel fabrication plant in Tennessee, which reported the loss of uranium suitable for making nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Leader of the Government give an undertaking that this incredible attitude over Kampuchea will not in any way delay the airlifting of substantial quantities of aid, of the magnitude of 700 tonnes of food a week which was flown into Cambodia by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> at the height of the Vietnam war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As stated in that article, at a meeting between the Prime Minister and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador,  Mr Philip  Alston junior, on 7 February 1979 at Parliament House, Canberra, did the Prime Minister make a threat that if Australia did not receive Washington’s support on agriculture in the multilateral trade negotiations the future of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence facilities in Australia could be jeopardised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has approved a number of ventures involving interests from Japan, the Republic of Korea, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Poland to carry out these projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, as has been made apparent in the report of the Pike Committee, which is the House of Representatives Select Committee on Intelligence, the secret vote associated with security activities in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> very substantially exceedsindeed, by a factor of five said the Pike Committee- what had been acknowledged publicly to be the size of the actual expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one takes into account all the different personnel, equipment and property costs that are hidden away under other departmental appropriations and under different items of a more innocent looking character, the Office of Management and Budget in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> found that the real cost was of an order of five times greater than the officially acknowledged cost for intelligence activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here one must quote the <span class="highlight">United States</span> experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the case that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> revelations about the operations and activities of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have amounted to a devastating indictment of the kind of lack of accountability that is here involved in the Audit Act and in these regulations made under the Audit Act, the disallowance of which I am now moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> record I draw attention to the report of the Church committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which reported in 1975, the Pike committee, which I have already referred to and which reported in 1 976, and the Inouye committee, which is the name of the committee which took over the subsequent sessions  or  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and which has conducted more recently hearings on whether the disclosure of funds authorised for intelligence action is in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to these <span class="highlight">United States</span> committees, I am not referring to the information which has emerged about assassination plots, about mail openings, about FBI break-ins or about the kind of scurrilous disinformation campaigns which have been associated with Martin Luther King and in much more recent days with actress Jean Seberg. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me list some of the illustrations to have emerged from these <span class="highlight">United States</span> reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I refer to the revelation by the Church committee as to the precise dollar-worth of the support given by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to the overthrow of the Allende regime in Chile after 1970, namely $8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were able to get away with it because of the total lack of effective accounting auditing scrutiny by the Government Accounting Office in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally among this fairly random list of examples from the 1975 ‘Report to the  President  by the Commission on CIA Activities within the <span class="highlight">United States</span>’, there is a fascinating illustration of funds under the CIA vote being used not for intelligence but for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are a diverse set of examples of varying magnitude and of financial significance but equal degrees of significance in terms of the lessons for Australia about what can happen if we do not have proper accountability mechanisms of an independent kind- of the kind that have been universally urged by all of those <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional committee reports to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Health advises that, despite immediate requests to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> authorities following Australian Press reports of the proposed withdrawal of methapyrilene in that country, it was many weeks before the detailed scientific data on the animal studies conducted in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> was made available for consideration by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not hang on their coat tails in that sense any more than we would hang on the coat tails of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in recognising neither regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we say that we must never do anything to offend the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America because it wants us to recognise the Pol Pot regime? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, however, that it is not possible for me to achieve anything for as long as the non-aligned countries and all of the Western countries, except the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, France, Canada and West Germany, continue to recognise the Pol Pot Government and the Cambodian seat in the United Nations is occupied by a Pol Pot representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Politics will stand in the way if we as a nation continue to follow blindly what the <span class="highlight">United States</span> says we must do, if we follow blindly what China says we must do, or if we adopt the attitude that we must not offend China because we want to sell our wheat to China, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1964 an advisory committee to the Surgeon-General of the Public Health Service in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> published a report entitled ‘Smoking and Health’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It states that the 1979 report reinforces the major conclusion from 1964 that cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to warrant appropriate remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Early in 1978  Mr Joseph  Califano, then Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, had this to say about smoking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact is that we have the worst of two worlds: On the one hand, perhaps private enterprise benefactors in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are more generous than they are here; and, on the other side of the coin, people back off in horror if it is suggested that we might emulate the attitudes of Eastern European countries to sports training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the conflict, will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to release sufficient parts of what has been termed the agreed record of the meeting, signed by Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> representatives, so that we can know what was the conversation in which so many people consider a threat was made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular I refer to books written by a most courageous experienced journalist, Bob Bottom, and a former senior officer of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Bernard Delaney, which allege that organised crime has now reached near catastrophic proportions in Australia similar to that prevailing in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and that profits to the syndicates each year are running into hundreds of millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that, sadly, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the United Kingdom there has been an upward trend in interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is reported that the Hanoibacked Government of Kampuchea has admitted that more than two million of its people are facing starvation but has said that offers of aid from the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Japan are tied to unacceptable political conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>As far as I am aware, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has not yet made a specific offer of aid to Kampuchea but has indicated that it would be prepared to contribute to international relief efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the understanding of the Government that the recently signed agreement between the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and China for the hydroelectric work does not preclude the possibility of services of other companies, such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, being also used in China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian and <span class="highlight">United States</span> certifications were granted after the respective authorities had conducted critical and intense evaluations of the aircraft’s flying qualities and design characteristics, with particular attention to flight safety standards laid down by those authorities, standards which are acknowledged throughout the world to be most rigorous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that immediately the Whitlam Government came to power in December 1972 there was a revaluation- an upward valuation- of the Australian dollar of about 7 per cent against the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar on the world market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that in recent times the world ‘s money markets have been affected very greatly by the dramatic increase in the price of gold, which was related to a decrease in the value of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar on the world’s markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is, as he would know- that is, I hope he knows- that Australia trades mostly in <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollars; consequently, the Australian dollar and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> dollar are tied together through the basket-weighted system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have little doubt that whatever is happening in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in this case is being considered by the Australian authorities, but I will get a proper and definitive reply from the honourable senator as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make the point quite clearly that the use of bodies such as the British NRDC and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> NSF has led to a situation in which the government has been able to make substantial investment in the private sector and has been able to make substantial progress in reversing the trends that have taken place in the decline in research and development expenditure in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the ore body of the Western Mining Corporation’s copper and uranium field at Olympic Dam on Roxby Downs sheep station in South Australia extends for more than 30 kilometres inside the security zone defined by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australian defence authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the Roxby Downs uranium deposit does not come within any security zone in which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government has an interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted quite recently from a newspaper source that a spokesman on behalf of the Federal Government said that in no time at all the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would be doing this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Agreement seeks to regulate the supply of sugar to the world free market with the objective of stabilising sugar prices within an agreed price range of 1 1 to 2 1 <span class="highlight">United States</span> cents per lb by the implementation and regulation of quota and stockholding obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 19 September  Senator Maunsell  asked a question of the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  relating to congressional approval for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to sign the International Sugar Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the present position in respect of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress ratifying the International Sugar Agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that unfortunately efforts made to obtain congressional approval of legislation that would enable the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to participate fully in the International Sugar Agreement have been proceeding for in excess of a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there appears to be no real opposition within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to the international legislation, it has become tied to other legislation for the implementation of a new domestic sugar policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further disturbing factor is that the European Economic Community has indicated that it has no intention of joining in the Agreement until the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has ratified it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The memorandum to which  Senator Wriedt  referred is one which has been submitted to the Court of Appeals in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to impress upon the court the seriousness with which the Australian Government considers its proceeding to assess against <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based upon the view that international comity would require that American anti-trust laws be administered in a way which does not reach out to conduct which has been alleged to be entered into outside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> by companies that are not nationals of or resident in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to point out in that paragraph of the memorandum to which  Senator Wriedt  referred is the fact that if courts in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> do not have regard to these matters and pronounce treble damages or make judgments which award enormous amounts of money, they naturally will continue to cause great irritation and concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to that we had had a long series of discussions on criminal proceedings that were being contemplated under the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust laws but which, fortunately, have not been proceeded with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was there a year ago we tried to persuade the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government to intervene in these civil proceedings and to put to the <span class="highlight">United States</span> courts the proposition that the courts should have regard to these international considerations when they are hearing civil suits under the anti-trust laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no first hand knowledge of any detailed proposal of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear wastes in any particular area of the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, for example, there is a sudden downturn in exports from Iran, its major customers, such as Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, will have to look elsewhere for their supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As any regular viewer of television will know, already it is not uncommon for Australia to receive the benefits of international satellite technology by way of satellite reports of important world events in Europe and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, Canada and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America are the three major countries which would have the most complications in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister state at a meeting with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Ambassador,  Mr Phillip  Alston, Jnr, at Parliament House, Canberra, on 7 February 1979, as reported in the publication  Inside Canberra,  that if Australia did not receive Washington’s support on agriculture in the multi-lateral trade negotiations, the future of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> defence facilities in Australia could be jeopardised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These reports have arisen out of comments by a spokesman for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> State Department on 19 September 1979 to the effect that 400 Soviet troops had been stationed at Bagram air base, 35 miles north of Kabul, and appeared to be providing security for the base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer him to a recent statement by  Mr Farouk  Khaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s political department, that the Arab oil producing states would use the oil weapon to influence next year’s presidential elections in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Yesterday Senator Georges asked me what attitude the Government had adopted towards the <span class="highlight">United States</span> consideration of the possibility of establishing facilities for the storage of spent nuclear fuel on a number of islands in the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has sought consultations with Pacific basin countries on the possible interim storage of spent fuel on a Pacific island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> is undertaking preliminary studies of the possibility of locating a facility for about 30 years on Palmyra, Midway or Wake islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facility would handle spent fuel from commercial nuclear power reactors located not  in the  <span class="highlight">United States</span> but in other countries of the Pacific area which have nuclear power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The studies derive from the requirements of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> non-proliferation Act and are aimed at providing an alternative to reprocessing of spent fuel by giving those countries a means to store their spent fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> has made clear that a primary consideration in deciding whether to proceed will be the health, safety and environmental impact of such a project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early sixties, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Soviet Union had some hundreds of nuclear warheads each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The recently concluded SALT II agreement took seven years to negotiate and has still not yet been ratified by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the comprehensive test ban treaty is being negotiated by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Great Britain, while the treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons remains the province of the two super-powers, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a start, as progress on reaching agreement occurred, both the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the USSR developed a vested interest in concluding the treaty which caused them to act with restraint in other areas to prevent negotiations breaking down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deployment of these missiles by NATO is based on distrust of the Soviet Union and a growing realisation that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> would not necessarily risk a nuclear war in the event of Western Europe being attacked by Warsaw Pact forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This deployment is supported by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which has gone so far as to launch a concerted campaign to win public support for the use of these missiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet offer has been seen by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and some European countries as a trick, as the reduction in Russian forces stationed in East Germany would be almost meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The price of the ratification by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate of the SALT treaty will be almost certainly a substantial increase in expenditure on arms by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last month, a report produced in France by the Prime Minister of that country proposes that France modernises its nuclear arms to match the quality of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The now discredited doctrines of mutually assured destruction and counterforce, both of which were developed by the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, were used at that time to justify the rapid build-ups in weaponry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent pressures to build up forces in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and in Europe have arisen because of the decrying by senior defence planners of the credibility of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> nuclear umbrella. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That 1969 decision was made some ten years after the  President  of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, General Eisenhower, had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General Eisenhower was a life-long soldier, devoted to the study of war, and to the build-up of <span class="highlight">United States</span> military might. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Carter was quoted in  Aviation Week and Space Technology  of 26 February this year, somewhat the same period, as saying that SALT II would allow the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to pursue all the defence programs it believed it may eventually need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate,  Senator Mark  Hatfield said that SALT was another one of those escalating steps in the nuclear arms race which would stimulate production of new weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Soviet Union would race to reach the maximum levels of nuclear weapons allowed under the Treaty, including missiles suitable for destroying the other nation’s offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its increased accuracy would give the <span class="highlight">United States</span> the potential by the 1980s to destroy Soviet land-based missiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that the nuclear arsenals of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will be growing, not shrinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could talk at length of the fact that a first strike would probably destroy 140 million people in the Soviet Union in a major nuclear war and that, similarly, something like 105 million to 1 30 million would be destroyed in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bulk of the annual arms expenditure is accounted for by six countries- the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, the USSR, China, France, Britain, and West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of this expenditure, Russia and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America together account for about 60 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the <span class="highlight">United States</span> spends about 5 per cent of its gross domestic product; the United Kingdom, 4.7 per cent; Sweden, a country with which we often compare ourselves, 3.4 per cent; and Australia, 2.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is probably proper for the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to ratify them but I cannot think of any marked effect they will have on the likelihood of a global nuclear war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is designed to communicate with American ballistic missile submarines, which because of their invulnerability, are second strike weapons designed, to enable the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to retaliate if a surprise attack is launched on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Hamer  also brought up the matter of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue is not simply about <span class="highlight">United States</span> bases in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Carter, when trying to convince the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate that he was not undermining <span class="highlight">United States</span> security, made this point in 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was  Senator Sim  who pointed out that the consumption of petroleum products by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> military machine alone is equivalent to all of that consumed in Africa in any one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would be easy to demonstate by a comparison of the growth of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> economy, as opposed to the Japanese economy since the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese national product of course has expanded very rapidly because funds have been available for research and development and for capital expenditure in the civilian sense, whereas in the United Statesalthough starting from a higher base- the gross national product has not grown as rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1930s in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> there was a situation similar to the situation we have now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he further aware that the percentage of GDP spent on research and development is declining substantially in both the United Kingdom and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he understand the relationship between investment in research and development and general economic growth indicated by the relative performances of West Germany and Japan, on the one hand, and of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom, on the other hand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other parts of his question were a little complicated in that they asked whether I was aware of certain percentages of expenditure by certain countries and, in particular, whether I was aware that research expenditure is declining in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom, compared with that of some other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another part of the honourable senator’s question- I think I understood it correctlyasked whether I understood the factors relating to the decline in research expenditure in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in the United Kingdom compared with the expenditure of some other countries which appear to have quite large budgets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House consider the only future for disarmament, for reduction in world tension and reduction in hostilities throughout the world, is through international agreement, even though international agreements of the type that this Committee is trying to achieve are made difficult by the fact that the world is dominated in this area by the two super-powers, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worth just reminding the Senate that this contemporary development in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, in Australia and in all of the Western countries was identified in a decision of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia, there have been a number of reports on industries by various and different bodies which indicate that the correct conclusions of the Congress decision which was made in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> were borne out in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is much more important to know what is happening inside the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and inside the Soviet Union than it is to know what is happening inside Bolivia or Uganda, or for that matter in Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the other super power, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, nobody I think is going to argue that there have not been and still are deprivations of human rights within that country from time to time, as there are in all other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do say that however critical any one may be of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and its policies and practices, we do not need to have an inquiry into that country in order to find out what is the situation with regard to human rights within the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kingdom Government in Northern Ireland; it has talked at length about the situation of the black population of the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, and indeed it is entitled to, because that is what we are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is free to comment on the situation in Northern Ireland and the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the situation in Australia and the situation in Chile, as I believe it is entitled, then we are entitled to comment on the situation inside the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the people who took part were:  Mr Ramsey  Clark, a former Attorney-General of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, not generally regarded as the spearhead of the John Birch Society; Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, Professor of Law at the University of London, a Labour life peer; the  President  of the French Criminal Court; the  President  of the Paris Bar; the VicePresident of the French League of Human Rights; the Professor of Law at the University Rene Descartes; Monsieur Gaston Monnerville, a former  President  of the French Senate, a leading French left wing politician and a resistance leader during the Second World War; a professor of law from the University of Mexico, Spanish by birth, a refugee from Franco’s Spain; from Great Britain, the Rt  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, in the 1930s, politicians in countries such as Britain, France, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and Australia had paid a little more attention to the deprivations of human rights inside Germany, Italy and Spain and if they had seen the sorts of things that Hitler and Mussolini were doing to their own people, rather than looking at some of these governments as any other governments with which to have ordinary intergovernmental relations, they may well have been much better aware of what was likely to happen to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not go quite as far as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> in that respect nor perhaps even adopt the precise language used in the 1973 Human Rights Bill in expressing rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would have thought that Article 1 of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Constitution, which makes the statement that it is necessary to have a well regulated militia should be used as the basis for striking down all gun control legislation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> or indeed that the provisions of Article 1 which relate to free speech should be used in the case of Buckley v.

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce aware that statistics of experience in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> indicate that six million jobs created in the non-government sector over the last 10 years have been in the small business sector while none of these has been created by the top 1,000 companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources whether the Australian Government agrees with the insanity prevailing in Iran, whose government is at present holding 100 <span class="highlight">United States</span> citizens prisoner and also holding the world to ransom with respect to oil supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we find that a member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission not only ignored  Mr Carter’s  appeal but also ran the risk of jeopardising the security of Australian citizens in Iran on Monday by ringing the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Embassy there and speaking to one of the Iranian students, causing emotional irritation, the consequence of which was completely unpredictable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights being, as it is, the product of consultations between governments and bearing none of the marks of having been generated in a crucible of conflict between the oppressed and a government of totalitarian complexion or the marks which characterise the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Bill of Rights, for example, which did emerge from people who felt themselves to be oppressed, it is not surprising that the so-called rights said to be secured are, in fact, constantly modified and eaten away by exceptions in favour of government regulation on grounds as vague as public health or morals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> Bill of Rights was imposed by the community- perhaps more accurately, by an articulate minority of the community- on the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America had a war of independence which was based on the slogan ‘No taxation without representation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Declaration of Independence, and then its Constitution, and then the ten amendments which was actually the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Bill of Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an important one, and I do not think that effectively that part of the Bill of Rights is used in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not until 1 920 that all those rights were extended to women in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights were of a practical kind and arose from the experience of the people in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America entrenched a Bill of Rights into its Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition takes the view that the whole history of federations- I refer not only to Australia in this respect but in particular to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>- is that they simply cannot be relied upon to protect through the participation of their member units the civil rights of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>United Nations, this Parliament ought to be involved and a practice ought to grow whereby this Parliament, whilst recognising that entering into treaties in our tradition as opposed to that of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> is a matter for the Executive, nevertheless ought to give its approval to such ratification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, could also be involved in the matter of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> anti-trust laws, does the Australian Government intend to work in concert with these countries in defending national interests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of those proceedings, orders have been made under the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976 prohibiting the production of documents located in Australia for the purpose of the proceedings in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judge decided to apply the <span class="highlight">United States</span> law, although in doing so he made it clear that the matter may call for further consideration if his order is not complied with and the question of sanctions arises for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw to the attention of the Senate that when an Estimates committee was dealing with the Department of Science and the Environment- and with the role of  Senator Webster’s  officers who were more or less acting in concert with the State- it was told that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government had not made a decision in regard to the importation of kangaroo products from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reasons it was mooted by Justice Fox are set out at length in the report, in which there is also reference to the precedents for such institutes of judicial administration in various overseas jurisdictions, notably the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America and Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While bodies of this kind exist in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the United Kingdom, the Government is not satisfied that there is any demonstrated present need for the establishment of a new body to deal with judicial administration in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If members of the Senate would have a look at the report and what we have said in this recommendation, they will see that there is nothing unique in Australia about having such an institute, that a number of them are operating very effectively in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and in England doing excellent work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the increase in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Federal Reserve Board’s discount rate from  1 1  per cent to  12  per cent on  6  October and associated measures to reduce the growth in the money supply, commercial prime lending rates in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> have risen to around  15Vi  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About six or seven years ago the <span class="highlight">United States</span> introduced a similar scheme, and a statistical analysis of that scheme shows that since the biennial, review came into existence the accident rate has actually gone up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attention has been drawn to the International Civil Aviation Organisation ‘s bulletin  General Aviation  of August 1979 and to an article therein by  Mr Malcolm  S.

    <p>Certainly, to my knowledge, this has been the practice of  members of  the Securities and Exchange Commission in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, where it has been felt that they should be completely above suspicion of possible personal gain arising out of that position and the information to which that position gives them access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1 975 the SenateHouse Conference Committee of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress, when dealing with the Securities Act amendments, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unless we achieve that uniformity, we are not likely to be successful in achieving the sorts of objectives which the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Congress referred to in 1975 when considering amendments to its securities legislation, which had arisen as a result of the creation in 1933 and 1934 of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Securities and Exchange Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Commission has the goodwill of the ministerial council made up of the six Attorneys-General from the States and the Commonwealth Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and provided it also is composed of people who are keen and who have the capacity and the vision to make it work, it can play the part that was envisaged by the Senate Committee in its report and which was envisaged by people in other countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which introduced the system which has worked extremely well in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 18 October 1979,  Senator Bonner  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs the following question without notice: 1 refer … to a recent report of the Department of Transportation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> which showed that 65 per cent of American cars and 25 per cent of imported cars tested would not protect the front seat passenger from fatal injuries at a speed of 60 kilometres an hour and the subsequent recommendation of the head of this department and the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that a rating system to assess at a glance a particular vehicle’s measure of safety protection in the event of a crash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, for example, there is a sudden downturn in exports from bran, its major customers, such as Japan and the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, will have to look elsewhere for their supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year the <span class="highlight">United States</span> has reduced its dependence on Iranian oil from about 12 per cent of its oil imports to about 4.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cessation of trade in oil between Iran and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should be seen in the light of this trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of complaints about diversion of some Australian aid supplies to soldiers in Kampuchea and of negotiations currently under way in Phnom Penh for <span class="highlight">United States</span> aid to be distributed by truck convoys which are planned to proceed across the Thai-Kampuchean border at Arunya Pratet into areas of northern Kampuchea which are reported to be among the worst affected by famine? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the proposal by the <span class="highlight">United States</span> for a convoy of trucks carrying relief supplies from Thailand into Kampuchea, I now understand that despite earlier optimism, the idea has been rejected by the authorities in Phnom Penh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addressing a question to the Attorney-General I invite him to take his mind off telephone taps and informers for a moment and to focus on perhaps the most sensitive single issue in Australia- <span class="highlight">United States</span> relations at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that the former Australian Ambassador to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>,  Mr Alan  Renouf, has stated in a letter to appear in the shortly forthcoming issue of the  Australian Law Journal  that in his view the Australian Government made an ‘error of magnitude ‘ in choosing to go to the International Court of Justice in this matter rather than to arbitration and that the Australian Government is quite likely to be seriously politically embarrassed, over time, as a result of this decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask what is the general state of negotiations on the Dillingham claim, there having been in recent days, I understand, a visit by <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government representatives to Australia to discuss the progress of this litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The discussions to which  Senator Evans  referred took place recently in Canberra between representatives of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Government and representatives of the Commonwealth Government led by the Solicitor-General,  Mr Byers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the object of the discussions held in Canberra was not to undertake further negotiations to reach a settlement about any other figure, but was simply to endeavour to convince the <span class="highlight">United States</span> officials that the Australian Government was taking a firm stand in relation to the matter and was confident of the correctness of the stand it was taking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of this, West Germany, France, the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America, and New Zealand now are using taxation to encourage the use of solar devices, insulation and anything else that could be a reasonable energy conserving method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United States</span> offers the buyers of solar, geothermal or wind generated equipment a tax credit of 30 per cent on the first $2,000 spent and $2,000 on the next $8,000 spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This seems to me- although I admit we did not see the project on the ground- to be an example of the destructive sort of aid which has been a feature of much of the aid from the World Bank and countries such as the <span class="highlight">United States</span>: The bigger is better approach, and be damned to pilot studies and the social consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We applied only a few days before we actually went to Phnom Penh and with the difficulties of communication over there it is clear that the Kampuchean authorities were very swift indeed in giving us approval to join the <span class="highlight">United States</span> congressional delegation to enter their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My first question to him is whether, accepting for the moment the good faith of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, it had available to it the report to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President  resulting from the Harrisburg incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was definitely reported to the <span class="highlight">United States</span>  President,  after very exhaustive surveys of the incident at Three-Mile Island, that there had been severe failures in construction methods and in management techniques in relation to the operation of that nuclear facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has failed to bring before the Senate in this so-called balanced view the very important findings of the <span class="highlight">United States</span> commission of inquiry into the Harrisburg incident which, in its report to the  President,  found that there were grave failures both in the engineering and management techniques applying to the operation of nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I went quickly through those 1 78 references which  Senator Coleman  incorporated in  Hansard  and I found that in 1 96 1 at Idaho Falls in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America three men were killed instantly in a nuclear reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is reference to an incident in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America on 12 January 1976-1 will not read it because no doubt  Senator Young  has read it- and the source is the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is so, does it mean that if the <span class="highlight">United States</span> lifted the present bans we could have a situation in which the targets for all the States would be boosted in anticipation of a bigger American market or would we wait until the end of the financial year to increase exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, had the <span class="highlight">United States</span> ratified the Agreement the stock financing fund would have come into operation and in the current circumstances the overseas sugar users would be bearing some of the costs of storing sugar stocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We express some concern that the Government has not been as active as it might have been in attempting to influence- I suppose that is the proper word to use- the <span class="highlight">United States</span> to ratify the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not so many years ago the fact that sugar was not available in restaurants and cafes in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America attracted a great deal of publicity in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were below the target prices of the International Sugar Agreement and they were below the average returns to the producers in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> and the EEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The further question raised by  Senator Wriedt  related to the situation in the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America in relation to its ratification of the International Sugar Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand the Commonwealth has maintained close contact with the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Administration to press Australia’s viewpoint that the <span class="highlight">United States</span> should ratify the International Sugar Agreement as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that recently the <span class="highlight">United States</span> Senate Foreign Relations Committee supported the ratification of the International Sugar Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know- the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  would know better than I dothat the fact that the <span class="highlight">United States</span>, with us, is supposed to be part of the free world does not mean that the Dillingham corporation is prepared to accept the initial compensation that the Government offered it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without straying too far from the Bill, it is because of that sort of attitude that I remain unconvinced about membership of this body together with the European Economic Community nations and the <span class="highlight">United States</span> of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
