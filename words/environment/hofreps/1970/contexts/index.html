    <p>The question of Australia’s involvement in  a  proposed international convention on the dumping of industrial wastes at sea has been the subject of correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Premiers commencing in July 1971 as well as discussions between Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for environmental control and also the Ministers responsible for port development and marine affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a statement issued after a meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council in Canberra on 27th July 1972 Ministers attached particular importance to the adoption of actions and procedures to check on dumping in the oceans off Australia and the implementation of adequate controls to prevent environmental damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Australian Labor Party still opposes this Bill, although it is not opposed to the Senate’s amendments which in effect have been moved in Committee by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  because as we see them they are somewhat similar to the amendments that we moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would expect the work and interests of the Institute to extend, as time goes on, over a very wide range of possibilities - for example, the study of the geology of the sea floor; the potential of the sea as a source of food and pharmacological products; the need for and means of conserving our marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>; the effect upon that <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the activities of man, in his attempts to win new treasures from the sea, and of predators, among which 1 would anticipate that the crown of thorns starfish would be a continuing subject of study until the problems it has created may have been solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has for many years urged the Government to do something about the chaos in the cities and now that the issue is in the forefront and has been taken up by all the mass media, the Government demonstrates its complete inability to gauge the tempo of the times by ignoring the whole question of <span class="highlight">environment</span> altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not hear, and I have never heard, the honourable member discuss to what extent these problems are contributed to and aggravated by the very high tariff protection which is given to secondary industry and which, in association with arbitration court decisions, creates the inflated and artificial <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the wheat growers and other primary producers must purchase their commodities in order to meet their financial obligations and to live with the same dignity as other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, this is the arena where our ability to construct the quality of our living <span class="highlight">environment</span> is being most obviously put to the test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our ultimate objective is surely the provision of a living <span class="highlight">environment</span> that will provide the quality of life that our people in this rich country have a right to expect; a living <span class="highlight">environment</span> that will give our people the opportunity to develop themselves to their full potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend that one of the prerequisites for the development of people is their involvement in the construction of their living <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the proper vehicle for this involvement is their local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our attitude is based on the simple premise, that if this wealthy country cannot solve the problems of its living <span class="highlight">environment</span> it is not because of the lack of resources but rather a failure of leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For years we have allowed greatly talented people, creative people, to leave these shores, not only in dozens but in battalions, and we have done little or nothing to bring them back to this country where they want to create and to make some contribution to our cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that if a nation is to be judged by posterity, if it is to be critically examined by historians, then the contribution we now make will be vital for the place we hold in an enlightened and cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is especially so if the structure of the social welfare programme is to penetrate into the heart of what is called the poverty <span class="highlight">environment</span> and overcome want and deficiency, and to help people to lift themselves up and participate at a level in the economy which will give them self respect and adequacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They then elaborate some 20 or more principal fields of research, which include, amongst others, marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, submarine geology, studies on the interaction of biological and geological problems, submarine organisms and so oh through the biological and physical fields of marine research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not yet touched on the question of the varying types of students of marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> who may be involved in these institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While 1 readily agree that the tropical <span class="highlight">environment</span> could be very well investigated - it would probably be hard to find a better site to do this than Townsville - I think we should by no means consider the Barrier Reef, the Queensland coast and that general area as the only source of operations for people who will be attached to this Australian Institute of Marine Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the basic difficulties in coming to grips with a submarine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, or even a surface marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, compared with the ability to move about on land, has inhibited development in this field relative to development on land up to the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These children of foreign origin, proficient in their own tongue and able to communicate in the home situation, have now to adjust themselves to an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where it becomes necessary to learn a completely new set of speech habits, the sounds, structures and vocabulary of their initial language being of little or no use to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be interesting to know whether he could talk about any other subject, for example, pollution, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, pensions, health or any other 1 of the tremendous issues that the people of Australia are concerned about other than the anti-Communist tactic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual matters in the Bill are themselves not very explicit but in his second reading speech the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  referred to the importance of a study of marine life, the potential of the sea and, particularly, the need for conservation of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leads me to enter this debate for the very good reason that he has said the Bill is not limited to what it says On the face of it, that is, the exploration of the Great Barrier Reef, but is mainly interested in the whole of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis, and following what might have been said by the honourable member for Cook  (Mr Dobie),  I speak in the debate because the electorate which I represent has a fair marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the sense that it covers quite a number of foreshores and beaches and also the Botany Bay area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become obvious from studies recently published overseas that among the greatest pollutants of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> are industrial waste and domestic sewage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard it has now been established that where you have this type of disposal of sewage and industrial waste and other forms of waste you are virtually destroying the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I look at the problem of the disposal of sewage and the effect that sewage has on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> I am led to suggest to the Minister that clause 7 be amended to provide that the Institute of Marine Science have branches throughout the Australian continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could not be a better opportunity to study the effect of pollution on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> than would be given by the establishment of a branch of the Institute adjacent to the sewage treatment works in the Botany Bay area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also a matter which has not yet been mentioned but which should be mentioned is the dredging of the Bay for the extension of the Mascot Airport and what effect the dredging of the area might have on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we allow this to continue at Malabar, or anywhere else for that matter, we are virtually destroying whatever marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> we have left there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is completely hopeless from the point of view of trying to maintain the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have established clearly that when we dispose of sewage - raw sewage, if we may use that term - into a marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> it does not dissipate the bacterial infection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that, in the area that I represent, many medical practitioners treat a number of illnesses that they are not prepared to say, from a scientific point of view, are associated directly with people surfing off Malabar Beach or being involved in the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I feel that these illnesses could well be associated with this <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another more tragic aspect for the whole area is that a major teaching hospital there which would be the subject of grants from  a  University point of view - the payment of federal money, if I may put it that way - disposes of its sewage directly into the same <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Malabar outfall and the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> in that area, we see that there can be no better opportunity than this area for any scientific group to have a quick look at the pollution that has taken place already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sewage has been disposed of in that area since 1890 and it is well recognised that this sewage has affected already the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When public meetings are held in the area that I represent and the Premier of New South Wales says to the gathering: ‘1 am writing to the Prime Minister asking that he give mc more money’, it should be recognised that that will not solve the problems to the tertiary stage or in any way help in solving the pro blems of pollution of our marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we dispose into the modern <span class="highlight">environment</span> something which will pollute and destroy it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the unfortunate people who live in this area, along with the many thousands who use the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the beaches, have to put up with an aggravation of a nuisance that they have suffered for years; they also will have the additional problem of all the destroying features of industrial waste dumped through the same sewerage outlet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should the Commonwealth of Australia seek to create a political <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we will be able to stand in the eyes of the world and be recognised as being conscious of the fact that the maritime super-power is coming into our area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this to him: If South Africa were prepared to cooperate in certain particular strategic environments with Australia, Australia would be, as is the Government of the United Kingdom at this time, prepared to acknowledge that co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether there would be a need for a pact, as the honourable member has put it, is dependent upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which a threat is seen to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We cannot blame people who live in a depressed <span class="highlight">environment</span> for trying to escape in the television tube to get away from the depression which their <span class="highlight">environment</span> fosters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well understand this situation if it is one way of drugging his senses against the depression and frustrations of living in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a simple recognition of the fact that the production <span class="highlight">environment</span> differs in the different States. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, a matter which has received a great deal of attention in recent times is the effect that industrial development is having on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope in this case that Government opinion will not lag very far behind public opinion and that when matters of industrial development are considered concurrent attention will be given to the effects it will have on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe a pressure group in the United States of America called Zero Economic Growth Incorporated has been formed and that this group does not want anything done to increase industrial development because it fears that the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> might completely outweigh any economic advantages that might accrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us have as much industrial development as we can, but let us qualify that by saying: Just have that amount of industrial development that is consonant with minimal over exploitation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by man, exploitation of man by man or exploitation of man by machine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House we believe that these aims of industrial development, hand in hand with desirable social changes and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, can be achieved only by democratic socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These objectives are to be achieved in a private enterprise <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the terms of the Bill ensure that it will operate within the principles of the free enterprise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So 1 pose to him this question: How do we tell what can motivate indigenous people to rise above their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to take proper jobs and acquire higher qualifications? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They see what is tantamount to a cement jungle - a sterile <span class="highlight">environment</span> - with hardly a blade of grass, a tree or a living plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not mean to say, for instance, that if one or two half-trained academics are loose in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> up there and hold the view that kiaps must get out or that we must lop the heads off the while people, that is a national aspiration of which we need take much note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the fact that this Bill is concerned with maintaining the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and that includes the whole Botany Bay complex and also the beaches immediately adjoining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is virtually misleading the people in my area to leave the whole problem to what might be termed the sanitary engineers who may, of course, effectively design a better treatment works for the more effective and quicker discharge of effluent, but if the water itself is so polluted, that in turn destroys the whole of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>), we not limit this provision to the Barrier Reef but relate it to the problems created for the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, by allowing sewage to be discharged without proper treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no necessity for me to go over the statistics which highlight the fact that young Aboriginal children in many parts of Australia have a mortality rate which is some 22 times in excess of that of European children who live in the same <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In’ this discussion I do not want to deal with the pollution of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>: I intend to deal with that aspect when we are debating the estimates for the Department of National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the management of the station complies with the standards and procedures approved by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in relation to nuclear health and safety, the release of radioactivity into the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and such other matters as related to the safe operation of nuclear facilities at the station; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So that general calls for more housing, lower costs and improvement in <span class="highlight">environment</span> do not get us very far forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one calls for an improvement in standards and <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which it is quite proper for anyone to do, one must always remember that it will involve more cost and that the additional expenditure in meeting that cost will have to be taken from something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the Migration Planning Council can only add to the effectiveness of this Council and, together with the Immigration Advisory Council and the Immigration Publicity Council, it will act as a source of good advice to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt the new navigational aids that are required will result in further charges to the companies and will develop a situation in Perth similar to that described in the ‘Doomsday Book’ by Gordon Rattray Taylor where continuous aircraft noise will be a permanent part of the urban and suburban <span class="highlight">environment</span> throughout most of Britain by 1983. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the best way of applying a thoroughly comprehensive national plan for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we must establish a Federal environmental bureau which defines the optimum human <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a series of goats towards which all Federal and State agencies work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Acts should be comprehensive, cover the whole human, physical and psychological <span class="highlight">environment</span> and be based on goals already mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can strive for uniformity by levying taxes in accordance with the legislation - for example, special taxes on pollution, tax incentives to encourage pollution control, and if necessary, a tax surcharge to encourage pollution control - and giving grants to States, local and semigovernment authorities, to ensure a system of policing the environmental effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, once legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth and by all the States, a joint Commonwealth and State authority should administer pollution and <span class="highlight">environment</span> control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the problem is one of balance because, in fact, we do want and expect the benefits of a modern industrialised society and we cannot have these benefits without some disturbance to the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whenever people come together in cities, wherever goods are manufactured and wherever and however people travel, problems of environmental disturbance arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the greater the concentration of people, the greater the demand for consumer goods and the greater the development of technology and industry, the greater the amount of environmental disturbance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious that we cannot live in this world and totally avoid any alteration of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we must ensure is that in altering this <span class="highlight">environment</span> we do not destroy our capacity to live healthily or in aesthetically satisfying conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the air pollution committee reported more than 13 months ago, ‘in any future arrangements for the study of pollution problems, cognisance should be taken of the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the interaction of the different facets of what is virtually one problem’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is thus important that the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> be seen in relation to the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that the psychological, social, cultural and technological variables be considered when analysing the destructive influence of man on bis surroundings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a discussion in ‘Business Week’ of April 1970 on ‘Pollution and the Profit Motive*, it is suggested that economists are at last wondering how to relate the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The minority report which the honourable member for Leichhardt and 1 submitted was to this effect: Unless the Government is able to convince the Parliament that the work is urgent, further investigation should be carried out to ensure that impairment of the Cockburn Sound <span class="highlight">environment</span> will not occur’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the words ‘unless the Government is able to convince the Parliament that the work is urgent’ are very interpretative and they apply not only to the environmental situation but could well apply to the strategic situation as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope however that we do not engage in this impetuous decision-taking in the future and that we have more regard for the preservation of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, ecology and the best interests of the Australian people when we take into account the serious matters which concern us about defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote from this submission because it makes me think that the Committee has thought about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> only as an afterthought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the point that most concerns me about the report of the Public Works Committee is that while the function of the Public Works Committee is to make an examination of the project from the standpoint of engineering and economic feasibility and effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the strategic considerations are really primarily the concern of Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thi: former Prime Minister told me on 24th February that while establishment of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> had been postponed, he had written to the Premiers on 11 th December about a National Advisory Council on Pollution which would be established as soon as replies had been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst not opposing establishment of a Commonwealth-State Advisory Council on Pollution, we believe that establishment of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is incomparably more important and should no longer be postponed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think there is no doubt that the Australian people, as well as the members of this Parliament, recognise the problems of pollution and the problems in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which result from pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that work on the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> has been done in the transport area and I hope that my colleague, the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Nixon),  will participate in this debate and that he will deal with pollution in his area of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposed Office of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> can act in 2 main ways: Firstly, by developing programmes designed to rectify past mistakes; secondly, by developing programmes which will institute sound planning and resource management to prevent the mistakes being made in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only other point in his speech worth mentioning is that his interpretation of what the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> can do in the Commonwealth field is really a rehash in his own words of the policy speech of the former Prime Minister delivered last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having heard the Postmaster-General  (Sir Alan Hulme)  explain the Commonwealth’s activities in connection with pollution and <span class="highlight">environment</span> across a very broad field, one has to come to the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  today in moving this resolution is jumping on one of his usual band wagons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concept of the imposition of standards for the treatment of wastes or for other practices presupposes the establishment of programmes for collection of the data which will provide a measure of the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly air and water but including land, flora and fauna: the establishment of standards to be set; and an adequate legal and administrative framework to ensure adherence to standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my book, pollution is the unnecessary, ugly or dangerous change in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is not in the best interests of the community; not just in terms of finance and economics but culturally and physically in terms of its health or in terms of the real security of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very interesting to consider the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the original policy of military and diplomatic isolation of China evolved and to see some of the justifications on which this policy of separation of China from the world community was based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This policy was aimed also at preventing the expansion of Russian power because, interestingly enough, in the early 1950s, the official American view in this <span class="highlight">environment</span> of antiCommunism was that China was in fact merely an extension of Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface it by referring him to the remarks, as published, of  Mr Commissioner  Winter, to the effect that unless a satisfactory price-wage relationship could be secured he was not optimistic for the future of any kind of reasonable industrial relations and that wage earners could not have their real living standards suffering erosion from the very moment an arbitrator set a fair and reasonable standard in the current economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am thinking particularly of the discharge of Commonwealth responsibilities in the fields of Aboriginal Affairs, the Arts and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The administration of Aboriginal affairs and of Commonwealth functions in the fields of the arts and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are among those to be transferred to the new Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there is what has come to be called ‘the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An office to bring together and generally to superintend the Commonwealth’s work and responsibilities in the environmental field is a new initiative, and an important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has seemed desirable at the same time to add what will be a rapidly developing role in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be renewed emphasis upon the importance the Government attaches to three different groups of responsibilities - in Aboriginal Affairs; in the arts; and in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the pre-school the door is opened to a wider range of creative and imaginative activities than is provided in the homes and neighbourhoods of many children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The growth of self reliance and social co-operation gives this educational <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the preschool a value that scarcely needs emphasising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>However, the Labor Party’s Pre-School Commission will aim not only to ensure equal access for all children to a preschool education but also to discriminate in favour of those who are disadvantaged by the limitations of home <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>facility to the ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> at Cockburn Sound was regarded by the Public Works Committee as being, not of great importance; that the Committee felt that there were no major ecological considerations or any question of damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> there, and therefore the Public Works Committee felt, with a clear conscience, that it was quite in order to go ahead and recommended the’ -expenditure for Cockburn Sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that now that he has divested himself of so many of his responsibilities for Aboriginal affairs, the arts, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a very great number of other administra tive or housekeeping functions, the Prime Minister will give proper attention to those matters which in a Federal system require co-operation by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me deal briefly with the four key areas of responsibility - Aboriginal affairs, the arts, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and tourism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to this question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will digress here for a moment to say that it is an important issue - so important that the British Government has appointed a Ministry for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> with no other responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out very cogently and quite clearly, the time has now arrived in this country when the whole environmental question is deserving of a single Ministry with the subsequent responsibility that this will bring about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept that a Ministry that is a kaleidoscope of tourism, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and of so many other extraordinary sorts of responsibilities will be able to carry out effectively and efficiently the contribution and the assistance to the arts that was enunciated by the former Prime Minister, now the Minister for Defence  (Mr Gorton). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It highlights the lip service paid by this Prime Minister to the arts and, indeed, to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures advanced by the Prime Minister in no way accord the priorities to the arts, to Aboriginal affairs or to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> consistent with the needs and the aspirations of the Australian people in this, the last term of the century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot expect wage earners to have their real living standards suffering erosion from the very moment an arbitrator sets what he considers to be a fair and reasonable standard in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which he’ determines the standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years, since sensitive chemical analysis has permitted the detection of minute amounts of chlorinated chemical compounds in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, concern has been expressed about the possible effects of such materials as organochlorine pesticides (e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say who in Australia is responsible for (a) regulating and controlling the release of these metals into the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, recognising the fact that most heavy metals eventually finish up in off-shore waters and (b) measuring their concentrations in food produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No single authority in Australia is charged with the responsibility for (a) regulating and controlling the release of these metals into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or (b) measuring their concentrations in food produce; however, with respect to (a) State and Commonwealth Departments of Health exercise a general supervisory role and with respect to (b) State Health Departments, the Department of Customs and Excise and other Laboratories perform this function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is responsible for advising the Commonwealth and recommending action that should be taken to prevent or reduce pollution arising out of the activities of any Commonwealth Department or Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In submitting proposals to the Secretary-General regarding the review of the United Nations’ Charter, which are required before 1st July 1972, will the Government give consideration to the need to move for (a) negotiating an international exchange of press space and broadcasting time, (b) representation for China and Tibet separately (as for the Soviet Union, the Ukraine and Byelorussia) to encourage China to accept de facto representation for Taiwan, and separate representation for contending regimes in other divided countries, (c) universal suffrage in developing nations as a step towards democratic representation at the General Assembly or an associated House of Deputies and (d) growing legislative, judicial and executive powers for the United Nations as a pre-requisite for total disarmament, co-ordinated world development and control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, subject to safeguards for national sovereignty in purely national matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-22">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope that all honourable members will take this opportunity of studing this report which shows what tremendous tourist potential is available if the Great Barrier Reef is developed in an imaginative and orderly manner while still preserving the ecological <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is so important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Spending on <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the arts is reduced by nearly $lm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably most of this reduction will be effected by postponing establishment of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> - deemed to be a matter of urgency by the former Prime Minister at the last Senate election and as recently as last Wednesday still awaiting ‘final approval’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked  the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the decision to postpone the establishment of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> indicate that in the Government’s view the Commonwealth need not play a leading and co-ordinating role in the development of  a  rational environmental policy or that the role is unimportant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the effect of the Budget on productivity and growth we must also consider the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise of course that, because of our peculiar Constitution, control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> rests chiefly with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, this House must be concerned because of the very substantial economic effects and because of the diversion of resources which environmental control will cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assuming that the economy settles down and gets on a fairly even keel again so that financial landmarks are not continually eroded by the process of increased prices, one of the things that impress me is this: If in the future governments are to play a larger part in the economic life of the country by undertaking some of the new things that have been proposed in the fields of education, health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I wish to join the honourable member for Isaacs  (Mr Hamer)  in urging the Government to consider the problem of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to  the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he made arrangements to meet the States to discuss the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that some large and powerful firms are anxious to co-operate with the appropriate authorities in the protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of the great interest of the honourable members for Macarthur and Bradfield and many other honourable members in the work that this Government is doing in the field of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the last part of the question I am certain that as a result of increased activity, not only on the Federal scene but also in the States, a larger number of companies have been taking much greater care to prevent damage which might otherwise have been occasioned to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a result of their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, will he support the call for a public inquiry into the Clutha scheme to consider claims that special privilege has been given to this overseas company, that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is seriously threatened and that the economics of the scheme deny a fair return to the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on housing, urban affairs and <span class="highlight">environment</span> I was appalled that the McMahon Government continues to accord housing a low priority in Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The newly appointed Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  would be better described as the Minister for spare parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This exemplifies the Government’s priorities on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is difficult to have a debate on such a topic in this Parliament I intend to devote my comments in this debate to the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter if man’s value system - and I even include the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who is at the table - is Communist, Fascist, Conservative, Liberal or Socialist, he faces a global crisis based on the fact that his population increase, his squandering of natural resources, his control of food production, his accelerated urbanisation and his release of a wide variety of toxic substances into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are directing him on a collision course with disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us be the leader in moves for a good global <span class="highlight">environment</span> policy and let us work for population control, pollution control and a rational rate of use of natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that a Federal Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has been established, we should define immediately the optimum human <span class="highlight">environment</span> by a series of goals towards which the Federal and State agencies should work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Acts should be comprehensive, cover the whole human, physical and psychological <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can strive for uniformity by levying special taxes on pollution, by tax incentives and, if necessary, a tax surcharge to encourage pollution control, and by giving grants to States, local and semi-government authorities to ensure a system of policing the <span class="highlight">environment</span> effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should look at our population policy at home and decide on what kind of total population increase, natural and immigrant, our <span class="highlight">environment</span> can handle over a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that some positive action will be taken by the Government and that it has not appointed a Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> just to detract from the criticism of the conditions existing in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A good deal of what the honourable member for Reid said about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and growing problems in relation to population growth and future trends would be matters with which we would all be in agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the question of the preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a world problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Reid who preceded me in this debate made some very thoughtful comments about our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some parts of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and heritage, however, must be retained in their present condition for science, recreation, or use in the more remote future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not criticising the newly appointed Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts; quite the contrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an absurdity to include the important portfolio of the Arts - here I speak in the broadest terms - with that of Aboriginal Affairs, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Tourism and the multiplicity of activities for which this Minister is responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Budget is successful in changing attitudes to inflation; if it encourages employers to behave responsibly in dealing with excessive wage demands; if it gives unions a more realistic appreciation of the capacity of the economy to absorb wage increases; and if it alters the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of almost unqualified optimism in which industrial tribunals have operated - if it does these things, even if only partly, then we will have been very well served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  will know that when the steel works at Port Kembla were erected we did not bother about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are going to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> with tremendous skill and with the best advice in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My friend from Reid  (Mr Uren)  has raised the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to have an appreciation that it is not only a matter of serving the people with field social workers but other factors are included such as housing and more importantly education and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance is that it is an established fact that children who have the opportunity to attend a pre-school develop certain personal skills; develop a better ability to handle conceptualisation; they develop their tactile abilities and so on and in addition they develop certain personality traits which allow them to adjust to group <span class="highlight">environment</span> more easily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the human component, examples of such factors include age and the influence of alcohol; for the vehicle, visibility, handling behaviour and the efficiency of the braking system; and for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, highway design and layout, and traffic management measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples of factors concerned here are, for the human being, the use of seat belts or the wearing of crash helmets; for the vehicle, interior design; for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the design of roadside furniture and the properties of natural hazards such as trees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such factors include, for the human, the quality of medical care; for the vehicle, the chance of a fire occurring as a result of impact; and for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the ease with which rescuers and medical teams can reach the scene of the crash and evacuate the injured from it to suitable medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This conference was referred to earlier in this debate by the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  lt was a conference arranged by the Working Centre of the 11 provincial parliaments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the theme of the conference was ‘The <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delegates at the conference were left in no doubt that the problem of pollution and the destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is one which cannot be dealt with by one country in isolation and that laws relating to pollution, whether it be of the air, or of water, and to the destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, have to be dealt with at international level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canberra is a first-class example of decentralised urbanisation which has produced a good <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a pleasant place in which to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to effects on ecology these are now matters which, at the Commonwealth level, are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was an extraordinarily good move in that it set up a team of scientists in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they were to work and to apply their results rather than in Canberra, Brisbane or some other capital city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A home visitor can visit these lonely old people and keep them buoyed up, interested in their society and in their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so help to delay the erosion of age which otherwise could lead to them suffering mental degeneration and eventual incarceration in some sort of home where there is no stimulation or interest for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now have the spectre of rural ghost towns, of agricultural wastelands, as people are being forced to the great city environments, not of their own volition but because of Government ineptitude in policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this the great vision of decentralisation, when people are forced out of an industry they have created with their own vigour, their own intelligence, and their own capability and capacity, to an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that they do not want and an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is incapable of supporting them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1901 we had no Department of Civil Aviation, no Navy that was established in 1911 by a Labor Government no Royal Australian Air Force, no Repatriation Department, no Department of Social Services, no organised Commonwealth marketing schemes in primary industry, no medical and hospital benefits legislation, no Commonwealth education and science legislation, no uniform taxation, no restrictive trade practices legislation, no uniform marriage or divorce laws, no Commonwealth Department of Housing no external territories responsibilities, no industrial legislation, no national service, no national development responsibilities, no departments covering Aboriginal affairs, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the arts, no tourist activity responsibilities, no shipping and transport responsibilities including Commonwealth ships, and no organisation relating to trade and industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, what I have in mind was illustrated by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  a few days ago when he was asked a question about the $7m proposed for the establishment of a national film and television school to educate actors, television producers and the like which had been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and I preface it by referring to a statement issued by the Minister for the Interior in which he referred to the establishment of an advisory council on the projected use of Commonwealth land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take the matter a stage further, within recent weeks I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and I have pointed out to him that he is to proceed as quickly as possible to collect all the evidence that becomes available to him so that the proposal can be presented to the Government well before the next Budget and not necessarily therefore in a budget context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware of the shortage of skilled personnel in almost every profession in our community, and we should be able to understand that in this <span class="highlight">environment</span> now is not the time for the Commonwealth Parliament to be seeking to extend its influence and thus create unnecessary burdens for the departments of Slate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our workers want jobs, long service leave, reasonable wages and security and the right to full employment and be employed in their own <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but if they want those things, we must be prepared to pay for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the third area of industrial relations is concerned, that is, the function of government, let me make it clear to the House - the honourable gentleman did not raise it- that we as a Government recognise the need to establish a satisfactory legislative <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which industrial relations can be effectively ordered, and we will do so, but we will not do it at the expense of destroying the system which is inherent in what the Opposition put forward yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I call the Minister, as there seems to be some confusion in the minds of honourable members as to the correct way in which the Minister should be addressed, I suggest to all honourable members that the Minister be addressed as the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  is just as much a product of the Australian society and Australian education system as we are, and we all remember the answer he gave to a question asked by the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  relating to population and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The home <span class="highlight">environment</span> is another factor that would result in many of them not being stimulated to go on even if this could be afforded and even if scholarships were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the moment deprivation in the home - that is, in the homes of low income earners, in migrant homes, in Aboriginal homes, in the homes of unskilled workers and in broken homes - and the lack of a proper cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> retards children from this background and perpetuates inequality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may mean anti-pollution measures to reduce respiratory disease; it may mean measures to improve the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> to reduce the incidence of psychoneurosis; it may mean safer motor cars and better road rules to reduce injury from road accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can divide environmental administration into  2  areas - policy making and problem solving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major policy which must be  made is a continuous updated statement  of an optimum human <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in physical, psychological and social terms - urban and rural. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem-solving agencies can then suggest the various alternative ways in which such an optimum <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem solvers will need complete data bank facilities and specialists and will receive environmental impact statements for all activities which will have any environmental impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Population policy, including immigration; natural resource policy, including exports of natural resources; science policy, including research policy; technology policy, including pollution control; educational policy and urban policy will all be influenced by the comprehensive environmental policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lumped together sp that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> policy reflects the <span class="highlight">environment</span> itself- a whole and integrated system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States of America, for example, has a problemsolving agency - the Council on Environ-, mental Quality - and a policy making agency - the Environmental Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Agency, the United States Government also has organised the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which integrates activities of the United States weather service, fisheries, sections formerly in the Department of the Navy on oceanography and all other sections of Government concerned with the oceans and the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  that we have an opportunity here to do likewise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only ask just what the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is supposed to be doing, especially as. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at the first meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> on 17th September it was agreed that basically no national policy towards pollution control was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, if this great problem of pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is to be checked, controlled and, of course, rectified, the only way in which it can be done is by the Commonwealth making available some of its financial resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been variously told by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  firstly, that in 12 months time consideration will be given to the recommendations made by the interim council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the question that 1 put to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  this afternoon, I asked specifically had he had any communication from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many of these problems will not go away so easily, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is probably the most pressing of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the special responsibilities of the States, the control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a national problem and should be concidered by the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only because the problem is in large measure an economic one, but also because environmental problems recognise no State boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 favour the solution adopted in Britain, of having a standing royal commission on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We urgently need such a body here, for neither this House, nor the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, nor the State Parliaments, nor any voluntary bodies are capable of carrying out this important and urgent investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Howson)  will set up such a standing royal commission on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other problem of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> on which we are lamentably ill-informed, is in the need for outdoor recreation space. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend this proposal, together with the other one on the establishment of a standing royal commission on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I asked the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  the following question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the Budget estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of the Ministry for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> really had its beginning during the last Senate election campaign when the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton),  made the Government’s intentions plainly known during that campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore have taken the decision to set up a Commonwealth Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> under the control of the Prime Minister’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every inhabitant of Australia can perceive today the disturbing signs of pollution and defacement of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the serious threats which endanger it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is being impaired as a result of the uncontrolled and indiscriminate use of space and irrational exploita tion of resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential firstly, that rational use and management of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> must have high priority in national government policy and must be adequately financed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, legislation and regulations introduced to safeguard the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its quality should be harmonised to the extent necessary at the Australian level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians are only just beginning to observe the effects of pollution, and the Federal Government and the State governments are just beginning to give prominence to the subject by creating active ministries to control the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to eliminate the problems associated with air, water and soil pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see that most States have set up ministries of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that they are co-operating with the Federal Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watching television tonight, I was pleased to note that the New South Wales Government has set up at Lidcombe an environmental control office with a staff of 36. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were able to see at first hand the prominence that European countries give to this very important subject of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At its previous meeting the Council had spent 4 days discussing ways and means of assisting to improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in overcoming the pollution problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we arrived in England our party was taken by the parliamentarians of that nation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> station a few miles out of London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been very pleasing to note that the National Industry Council on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Quality Control has met in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is dealing with the protection and restoration of environmental quality and industry’s role in this immense task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the Australian Chemical Industry Council, the Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the National Packaging Association of Australia, the Petroleum Industry <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Conservation Committee, and the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These organisations are taking a very active interest in dealing with this problem which comes under the control of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, what I am trying to get at in relation to the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is that it is not a matter of rubbish or garbage disposal; it is a matter of pollution by over-population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are becoming more conscious of the fact that civilisation is gradually destroying the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which it inherited, thereby impairing the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe 1 have said enough to indicate that environmental hazards can and do transcend international boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But fortunately the governments of a great many countries in the world are aware of the seriousness of the problem and many of them, including Australia, have already established departments and ministries concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some housewives in the United States have formed themselves into an association to inform their members of the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of different types of products on the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year I was privileged to attend a conference on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which was held in Bonn in West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recommended that international treaties should be examined to ascertain their impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that parliaments of the world should be advised of the potential environmental effects of those treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recommended that tests should be conducted to ascertain the effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of non-degradable and toxic components and that the results of these tests should be published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recommended also that the United Nations Organisation should sponsor international environmental programmes and that an international pollution data bank should be established and that the function of this bank should be to collect information and to make it available to all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we in this Parliament should already be thinking along these lines and already doing much more than we are doing at present to combat both pollution and the destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> whilst we still have time on our side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the estimates now before the Committee, I intend to confine my remarks to a subject which in my opinion is receiving very little, if any, real attention from the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I see it the initial responsibility lies with the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts is surely the department which must take the initiative even though it will have to obtain the co-operation and assistance of those other departments to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, who is at the table, notwithstanding that his interest seems to be very little, will give us some satisfactory explanation of the contradiction that exists between those 2 replies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I wish to refer to the inept title of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and MinisterinCharge of Tourist Activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not deal at length with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and Aborigines beyond saying in the context of my particular thesis - the development of an Australian identity - that nothing could redound more to the advantage of our national image than, firstly, that we should succeed in dealing humanely and intelligently with the problem of promoting the happiness of and establishing a satisfactory relationship with our Aboriginals - ‘the first Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This evening we are devoting our attention to the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and we all recognise that some very thoughtful speeches have been made on both sides of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is a new Department which when it was set up came under some criticism as being a miscellaneous sort of department, there is no doubt that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has under his control some very important facets of the national life and some very important responsibilities that the Commonwealth has to meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have Aborigines living in a number of environments on government settlements and missions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the expenditure of Commonwealth money and where it is being spent we find that it is spent mainly on Aborigines who live in towns, and that the largest amounts of money spent have been on Aborigines other than those living in a fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we as a Government recognise the need to establish a satisfactory legislative <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which industrial relations can be effectively ordered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government was so concerned about the legislative <span class="highlight">environment</span>, there would be no need in this country to introduce such shocking legislation as the subsidised medical health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite stand up in this chamber and say that they will create a legislative <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Did the right honourable member for Higgins last night assert that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts had given the House figures which were not accurate and estimates which were misleading on the national film and television training school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did listen in on the intercommunication system last night to the speech made by the right honourable gentleman from Higgins and I heard that part of it relating to the figures that had been presented to the House by my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I can say is that if anyone knew the full story relating to the VIP incident, rather than being critical of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, he would say that he took upon himself an enormous responsibility when there was no need for him to have taken any responsibility whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  want to speak about a very important matter relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but first I want to register my disappointment and dismay at the reply given by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  to a question asked of him a couple of weeks ago by my colleague, the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within those years I have realised that the people of the world have become increasingly conscious of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live and are attempting to ensure that it is a healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> for themselves and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the last 20 to 25 years the progress in industry and communications and the increase in the number of city dwellers have created a situation in which man has to take a quick, serious look at the environmental problems which he has created and is still creating and which have certainly been to bis own detriment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, the term ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ covers many things which affect our daily lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had we been aware of the danger we faced by polluting our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, this could have been avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, we in Australia are in the position of being able to learn from the mistakes made by other countries and we still have time to plan our living <span class="highlight">environment</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would rather see half a dozen major centres with a healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> free from pollution than one major city complete with every known hazard to the health of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when one sees the evidence of the dangers that are created by pollution in a closely settled city which has been allowed to grow haphazardly - and this is what has happened in every major city in Australia - with no thought at all having been given to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, this argument becomes so much rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before we have the areas in which this development can take place; we now have a Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts; the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Howson)  is currently the Minister at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that it would be a long, hard and arduous task, but there is no doubt that it must be done in order to preserve our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to prevent these centres being allowed to grow in a haphazard fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way sensible and economic planning can be undertaken so that the best possible results for the preservation and maintenance of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is money if it means the preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> for ourselves and for future generations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke in a revolutionary and ardent way about the protection of the country against the destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but he supports a government which will hand over any of the more desirable spots in Australia to anybody who has a bulldozer and a cheque book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, to take the bit between his teeth in these matters and challenge the State authorities on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, will it despoil the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This procedure would be a nuisance to the residents in that <span class="highlight">environment</span> and it would cause dust and deterioration of the roadway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the time available to me I intend, naturally, to concern myself with Aboriginal welfare and with the way in which Aboriginals will benefit this year from the estimates of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts certainly has to think about these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things, some of which are more peripheral than others, must be taken into consideration if we are to be concerned about urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few places in the world where a greater majority of people live in an urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> than do Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I believe that a case has been fully established for an examination of this important area of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, for the simple reason that the greatest number of people in this country will be affected by environmental changes in that particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest number are involved in urban environments and by any predictions are likely to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, despite all the problems of the countryside - and there are some in relation to agriculture and pesticide use and that sort of thing - the fact is that the quality of urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the direction in which it is moving is the outstanding problem which remains for this or any other government in Australia to take on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to fling a lot of cheap criticism at the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  who is sitting at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main plea to the Government, to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Howson)  and to the House is that we should not give way to the temptation to make political capital out of such a desperately important subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt about the fact that these people have now moved out of their natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> in many cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make a few remarks in the debate on the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts mainly because of events that have taken place in the last few days in my electorate of Bowman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But frustrations have been thrust on her by the Government and by the Department administered by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  who sits at the table this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a most interesting time to see that all the facets of the Department - <span class="highlight">environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts - have come under scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  turn now to the matters raised on the subject of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that I should dwell for a short time on the role as I see it of the Commonwealth in our environmental affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had an opportunity to study the way in which Federal and State systems relating to environmental matters have been adopted in places throughout the world, but I have not studied it in great depth because the time has not been available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever there is a federal system there has to be a policy department of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and these have to be administrative departments that carry out individual environmental procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated to the House before and as the honourable member for Reid mentioned, there are seven or eight Commonwealth departments that administer various facets of environmental policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I believe that in environmental matters the role of the Commonwealth - exclusively; of its own responsibility - should be firstly to set an example within its own territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it should see that the administrative departments carry out the task and realise how important environmental matters are at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> should co-ordinate the policies of the various administrative departments and generally see that the whole matter is co-ordinated at Common*wealth level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I believe that in one State the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has to co-ordinate 14 other administrative departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could not afford this leaching of our society any more than we can now afford to allow our incomparable <span class="highlight">environment</span> to be despoiled and polluted by lack of foresight and conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Commonwealth, overall responsibility for the arts has been placed by me with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is increasingly clear that the superb natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> which this continent provides for human life can no longer be taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I have said, the arts should be deeply integrated into our lives, they too form part of the intellectual and cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> within which our lives are lived - offering diversity of experience and lending form and substance to our personal and natural identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, particularly in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the arts, much that we can learn from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They continue to this day and now advise the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Prime Minister tonight could have taken the opportunity to clear the air of assertions made by the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  in this House that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  had been inaccurate and misleading in information he had supplied to the House - a squalid performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 14th October, in reply to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, I undertook to look at figures concerning the proposals of the Interim Council for a National Film and Television Training School that my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  had presented to the House and at criticisms that had been made about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In doing so, they made it clear that their opposition was on behalf of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Lands, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and, indeed, the Premier of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, a most careful study has been made of the way in which the whole <span class="highlight">environment</span> of this area can be landscaped and improved and a very comprehensive programme of plantings of indigenous trees and shrubs, such as eucalypts, casuarinas, banksias, acacias and gre.villeas, will be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Navy, together with the other Commonwealth authorities, has indeed done well in maintaining the original kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that the original scrub and much of the original scenic beauty of Sydney Harbour has been retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as regards the overall matter of proportion, I personally as a Sydneysider, and I am sure all those members of my Department with whom I have discussed this matter are eager to see that to the greatest possible degree the objective of the New South Wales Government is realised in preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> not only of South Head but also of many other areas around Sydney Harbour which today are in the stages of preservation in which we now find them because of the long term occupation of these areas by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like a number of honourable members in this House, I am tremendously concerned about the future of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly that surrounding Sydney Harbour because, like the honourable member for Wentworth, I live in a very pleasant area of Sydney and the proposed Sydney Harbour national park is of tremendous interest not only to me and the people in my electorate but also to all the other people of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say this because in a world <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is changing throughout the 1970s - this may be a cause of alarm to my friend from Wills  (Mr Bryant)  - we will have a situation where, by 1990, the greatest naval power on this earth will be the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is not a member of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> because it was nol elected to membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-34-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that the letter from the  Chairman  of the Interim Council for the National Film and Television Training School about which he was asked yesterday by the honourable member for Franklin, and which he said he had not seen, was sent by the  Chairman  on 20th October and acknowledged by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts on 25th October? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that, because this matter was so sensitive, I thought it was desirable to appoint a group of Ministers to handle it and to receive letters and correspondence direct from the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> so that they would be able to prepare a speech for me and advise me as to the action that should be taken.They did this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not at any time, other than in respect of the number of trainees who should be trained at the film and television training school and the fact that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> had made an incorrect statement, taken any part whatsoever in the discussions relating to the report of the P &amp; A consultants or any comments that might be made by the  Chairman  of the Interim Council about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this way we could intermix people and we would not set up a group of people who are within a certain range of income or of any one <span class="highlight">environment</span> because this cannot bc to the advantage of the lot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister, before establishing a group of Ministers chaired by the Treasurer to handle the matter of the national film and television training school, advise the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Aru of his intention to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The control of the pollution of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> has become a problem that concerns all mankind: and in this local authorities have a pari to play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is sitting at the table, to study and consider the way in which the money has been allocated, particularly in respect of how much has been Spent on Cape Barren Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>; Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  made mention in his second reading speech of the fact that direct national expenditure on Aboriginal advancement for 1971-72 will be $44m for an estimated Aboriginal population of 140,000.It could be said that the Government has shown some consideration for the Aboriginal problem on that score alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should give some idea of the difficulties that Aborigines are facing in adapting to our technological <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one does find decent people in this <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the figures made available by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  there has been an increase from $3,650,000 in 1968-69 to $9,200,000 for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers of that Office look at the problems fairly and I am sure that the recommendations that they make to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  are well balanced and represent a much broader approach to the problems than is the case with many of the State administrations because the State administrations are tied down with their own administrative problems in settlements and reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are  3  environments, and I propose to deal briefly with each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been improvements in the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> on the settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, we have no effective programmes in the broad to cater for the Aborigines who live in a fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member will appreciate, there is a very great number of statutes which impinge on environmental control and pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will Australia support the Society’s resolutions to be submitted to the 1972 United Nations Conference on Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span>; if not, why noi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  deals with Aboriginal land rights alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without being too partisan in these matters, the development of Commonwealth assistance for Aborigines in the Northern Territory has been inhibited for too long, as not only the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts but his predecessor with responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  have found, by a succession of Country Party Ministers for the Interior, and it has been inhibited in the States by the fact that there is a predominantly Country Party Government in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has announced, as my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  has said, that an additional $13m is to be provided for the purchase of properties and land coming on the market from outside the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the Interior and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  have been patting themselves on the back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made another point which is relevant because both the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and the Minister for the Interior referred to the Yirrkala people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his statement the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  outlined the Government’s policy on Aboriginal land rights - a policy with which I am sure the great majority of our coloured people will be happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The available evidence suggests that in the older established industrial suburbs - which could only be restructured at enormous cost - industrial militancy is being aggravated by non-industrial frustrations stemming from excessive travelling times and costs, poor quality housing and/or the unavailability of housing finance except for newer dwellings in the outer suburbs, the increasingly high ratio of homesite costs to weekly earnings, and the impersonality, anonymity and lack of identification inherent in a conglomerate metropolitan <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the blessed word ‘Mesopotamia’ or ‘Mecca’, this is a delightful work that can be used at election time to tickle the minds of country voters, and idealists who live in the city and the city people who formerly lived in the country and who are eating their hearts out to get back to the country to live a worthwhile life and apply themselves to the problems of the nation in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that they know so well and among their friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In principle there was no difficulty in defining in general terms what was meant by an ‘educational priority area’: the Plowden Report itself speaks of areas where ‘educational handicaps are reinforced by social handicaps’ and the Department’s circular 11/67 refers to children in districts that ‘are suffering from multiple deprivation because of the combination of several disadvantages in their <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the Public Works Committee, and this Parliament too, to a very considerable degree now operates on this new dimension which never used to be much of a factor - the <span class="highlight">environment</span> factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion, it is not good enough in a wealthy country such as ours to have a gold-plated standard of services, whether they be in health, education, welfare or any other field - urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> is probably the outstanding example - in a national capital such as Canberra and then to find in the capital cities far greater aggregations of the nation’s population living in slums or resorting to slum standards of facilities such as our public health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- First of all, I hope that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  can assure us that there will be no impediment to or suspension of the activities in the area of the crafts which is currently being supported by the Arts Council of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not keen to shove them into units which would move them away from their traditional home site, their home in which they raised their families and with which they have had a long term association that is a sort of spiritual relationship with their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of those schools are a disgrace to a civilised society and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they have to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not be surprised if, despite the rather meagre facilities that it has and the rather austere <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it operates, it is not producing a more adventurous spirit inside the school about the educational principle than is produced almost anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Minister’s view much too large a proportion of families with children at state schools didn’t give their children the encouragement in their home <span class="highlight">environment</span> to encourage them to stay at school as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be hoped that ali information and research in this field is made public and that people who will be affected along the flight paths and adjacent to airports have a say in their future <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, as he said only some families he corrected himself - perhaps much too large a proportion of families- that is, whose children attend State schools - who don’t give their children the encouragement in the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> which helps them, or encourages them to stay at school as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At page 57 of the report on the Commonwealth’s Role in Teacher Education the Committee defines a deprived school as being a school in the inner urban or rural areas providing primary education, in which a high proportion of the school population is disadvantaged through background and/or <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to religious schools, I feel parents have the right to influence the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which their children are educated, provided they are prepared to make some personal sacrifice to obtain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say - and I do not qualify this statement one iota - that, man for man and in the particular <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the Australian Army operates, it is second to none in the whole of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These developments have made it more difficult for the Government to control the domestic national economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing internationalisation of some important sectors of industry and the growth of the multinational enterprise as an institutional development of foreign direct investment add  a  further dimension of complexity to the Government’s ability to control the national economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that in a speech on 9th March the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that a schools commission ‘could look at the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> of schools to cull out those with inadequate buildings and facilities, and insufficient teaching aids’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some of them have to do with inadequate <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they teach, some with the inadequate salaries and all that goes with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several State governments are, through their relevant departments, involved in studies of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in addition several of the universities have small research groups which are interested in biological and physical studies in the marine area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course important to ensure that the work of the Institute at its base at Cape Pallarenda will not be adversely affected by pollution of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Government is in close touch with the Queensland Government on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the last sitting day the Minister for Education and Science, in moving the second reading of the Australian Institute of Marine Science Bill, voiced concern at the possible pollution of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> by a proposed nickel smelter atTownsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fully aware, from my experience throughout Australia, that there is one salient scientific and economic fact, namely, for the gene build up of the Australian merino there has to be a climatic <span class="highlight">environment</span> suitable to that particular gene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued that Australia has the right <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly - and the honourable member for Dawson did mention this point - the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the wool is grown has a very large influence on the type of wool produced, and whether in fact sheep of a particular strain can survive is often determined by the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kind of Opposition do we have when it does not know that the reason why Australian merino wool has its pecular qualities is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it is bred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the Opposition know that the quality of merino wool varies all over Australia as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> changes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that great changes are occurring in Australia’s external <span class="highlight">environment</span> which justify a careful and progressive re-evaluation of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of tonight’s statement then is to define the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> which, in the view of the Government, is most likely to exist during this decade and could potentially exist in the 1980s; to describe how in general we believe Australian defence capabilities should be shaped in accordance with the responsibilities of an independent country; to make clear the Government’s policy of strengthening and not withdrawing from our international defence associations; to describe the burdens and the gains and the clear balance of national advantage which we believe flow from these associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It aims as well to remind the House of some of the perils which will arise if any Australian Government should flout our commitments or jeopardise confidence in our word or our endurance, or seek refuge from contemporary burdens by reducing the country’s defence capabilities and retreating from a military role in helping to maintain the security of the external <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which Australia is destined for all time to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential to try to foresee the way in which the nations who are great in terms of military and economic power will exercise that power in the are.a of Australia’s strategic concern - an area which comprehends our northern neighbourhood and the sea and air spaces of the maritime <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is, I believe, an essential ingredient of Australian diplomacy that Australia should be understood to be a country whose security interests are growing; whose population and wealth are growing; and whose determination to take some part in shaping the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live is more lively than ever now that the great western powers have served notice that their involvement in lesser situations is not to be taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can be achieved by a defence programme giving us the ability to project Australian armed strength beyond our continental shores is twofold: It will give future governments options to have some influence on events in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that we may contribute to the greater security of all countries in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that only if it preserves these practical options and thus preserves too the evident political option to support its neighbours will its military capabilities support its diplomatic and economic efforts in its <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Navy and the Air Force are concerned with the preservation of the security of our general maritime <span class="highlight">environment</span> and with freedom of navigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a lot of nonsense it is to say that the next Prime Minister of South Vietnam,  Mr Huong,  made a request through the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just one comment before 1 commence: It is interesting to note that Ambassador Anderson described the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  as the most fluent French  speaker  in the Australian foreign services; that is just for the record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure the honourable member, without making any commitment regarding his suggestion which I shall refer to my colleague in another place, that everything possible is being done to study the ultimate effects, if any, which this may have on the community or on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I think that it is a little out of keeping with the general context of our social <span class="highlight">environment</span> at the moment for it to be proposed that the average female teacher might suffer undue embarrassment in the early or middle stages of pregnancy by being in front of a class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State associations therefore tend to try to act as spokesmen for the industry, which they are frequently not competent to do because of their isolation or their own circumstances and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> surrounding them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ability to do this and to undertake ourselves the continuing protection of Australia’s expanding interests presupposes the existence of Australian forces organised, trained and equipped to be able to meet conditions in that external <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ministerial statement and its accompanying White Paper on defence have allowed what has been rather a wide ranging debate on this subject, a debate that has covered the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which Australia finds itself, the forces and equipment that Australia has and is likely to need, and the forward planning for the next decade or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The arguments that the Commonwealth and State governments have about the provision of money for hospitals, facilities for training, road safety measures, measures against pollution, sewerage and all the rest that man wants from his <span class="highlight">environment</span> nowadays, are 10 times worse in the field of local government and the finance that is channelled through the States to assist local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the Labor Party believes - this is not very far from the sentiments expressed by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who has just come into the chamber, in the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill introduced not long ago - that this sort of assistance is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particular attention is given to these elements as they are considered potentially the most hazardous of the radioactive materials released into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Commonwealth committee is the National Radiation Advisory Committee (NRAC) which reports to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and advises the Commonwealth Government on matters concerning the effects of ionising radiation, whatever its origin, on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These additions to the radioactive contamination of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, however, are being made against a background of the strontium 90 and caesium 137 remaining from the earlier tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I take the opportunity to report to the House the possible effect in Australia from the accidental release of plutonium 238 to the world <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a matter that has received some publicity recently in the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Newspaper reports have referred to the release of plutonium 238 into the world <span class="highlight">environment</span> in April 1964 as a result of the burn-up of the power generator contained in a United States satellite which disintegrated on entering the upper atmosphere after failing to gain the desired orbit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee has assisted and cooperated with the United States Atomic Energy Commission in a world wide programme to monitor plutonium 238 in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by con ducting sampling and providing materials from Australia for analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Commission on Radiological Protection has undertaken detailed study and has adopted a level of concentration of plutonium 238 in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which the general population could be exposed continuously without significantly endangering its health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current concentrations of plutonium 238 in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which are generally representative of the southern hemisphere are between one ten thousandth and one thousandth of the International Commission on Radiological Protection levels and can in no way be considered a hazard to health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that it seems an unusually cumbersome process to split responsibility for these monitoring programmes between two committees, one of which reports to the Minister for Supply and the other to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts,  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summation, I suggest to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, that he convey this submission to the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  so that he may review the constraints that I have, mentioned and so that he may look at the research project within the CSIRO which has been held up in order to evaluate what is being done and to indicate needs in a forward way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council acknowledges that waste disposal is the most pressing <span class="highlight">environment</span> problem facing Australia today and decided to study the problems of sharing the cost of waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-8">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, of course, recognises the need to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of this proposed park area and has already placed 2 areas of major ecological interest - Deaf Adder Valley and Jim Jim Falls - under a mining reserve, which means that no mining exploration shall take place in those 2 areas of special significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be unnecessary in today’s political and economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> and is merely evidence that one or both sides is unwilling or unable to act in accordance with the principles of goodwill and a sense of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is whether the honourable member can carry out his responsibilities to the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, The House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory as well as his responsibilities as chief Government Whip and go overseas as the Prime Minister’s representative to an <span class="highlight">environment</span> conference in Vienna in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts whether he has seen a report of comments made by Professor Ali Mazru of Uganda recommending a policy which encourages Aboriginal children to be educated with ot without the consent of their parents and suggesting that some degree of coercion is needed if Aboriginal children are to be separated from parental influence and absorbed, through education processes, into the mainstream of change? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the House what is proposed in Commonwealth administered areas to ensure that Aboriginal children are given every opportunity to overcome their present environmental handicap? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an interesting question relating to the problem of trying to maintain the family <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Aboriginal community and at the same time increasing education standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, a higher cost will be imposed on the private section of the community to protect what might be described as the public <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave all the technical reasons why it would be so wasteful to go ahead with the Institute of Marine Science there if the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it has to work can be polluted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could give no assurance that the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the Institute would have to work at Cape Pallarenda would remain unpolluted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unsafe to go ahead with the Institute of Marine Science Bill until the Commonwealth, which is financing this Institute, is able to ensure the proper <span class="highlight">environment</span> for it, and that can only be done if the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill is enacted and the States have an opportunity to test it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marine pollution from agricultural chemicals in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Townsville itself and the proposed establishment of a nickel refinery at Townsville are quite relevant to the argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he noted that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts stated 2 days later (Hansard, page 1391), in answer to question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now know that cancer-producing factors in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> are actually far more common, and more diverse, than we imagined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if education programmes, which I have said are the key to success, are to be successful we must create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they can be effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a campaign has to take place in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where $12m a year is being spent on cigarette promotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt has often been said that Australian government instrumentalities and other similar bodies are not anxious to accept or are not comfortable in accepting tenders from the Soviet Union or from Czechoslovakia because these countries are not experienced in working in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why the establishment of a potentially hostile <span class="highlight">environment</span> in either the Pacific or the Indian Oceans must be viewed with very great care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with what he said, but I think it would be wrong for Australia and it would be a dereliction of duty if, in considering Australia’s foreign policy, due weight were not given to the possibility of a hostile <span class="highlight">environment</span> being developed, particularly in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that we must be involved in these matters because it believes that our <span class="highlight">environment</span> will change and that, therefore, it is necessary to be involved in those changes to see that they occur in ways that will advance our cause and the general security of our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of building an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that we are concerned with when we are concerned with tariffs, because with tariffs we are concerned with the development of industry, the pattern and the type it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other Departments presently involved in the matter are the Departments of the Treasury and of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-38-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My purpose, therefore in addressing honourable members today, is to emphasise the Commonwealth Government’s deep interest in the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and our determination to do what we can, within our powers, to help solve those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basic to this is a healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we can develop a quality of life to satisfy our needs in all fields of human endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential, therefore, that we preserve the great gifts nature has given us and that we keep our <span class="highlight">environment</span> as free from man-made contamination as human skills can devise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I wish to commend the Government for its decision to participate in the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in Stockholm early in June of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I criticise the Government for not permitting those 2 members of the Parliament the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  and  Senator Keeffe  who will be attending a parliamentary world conference on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Vienna in late June to attend the Conference on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Stockholm early in June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I think that there has been some window dressing by the Government in regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just heard a Minister who is twenty seventh in seniority of the 27 Ministers in the Ministry make a statement on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am glad that the Government has now officially recognised the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  contains a few items which are very welcome but which are buried in a wealth of meaningless cliches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which is to be held in Stockholm in a few days, dramatises the fact that the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are global problems and Australia, as a part of the world, has to share its responsibility in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though representatives of the States will be going to this Conference in Stockholm it is the Commonwealth which will in the main represent Australia in the world environmental stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has at last recognised that environmental issues do exist, although depressingly it still emphasises only the pollution control aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> involves more than pollution control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Still unanswered on the notice paper is a question asked on 17th August last year by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the (a) date and (b) outcome of correspondence between the Commonwealth and States concerning the National Advisory Council on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> since the former Prime Minister’s answer on 24 February 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another question asked by the Leader of the Opposition of the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  aims at trying to pry out of the Government the composition and meeting dates of the interdepartmental working party on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> since 25th November 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is no way of assessing whether the interdepartmental working party on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is of any real use or is just a piece of window dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land filling of estuaries in Queensland for tourist development is having a profound environmental impact on the nearby marine ecosystem, although we barely have any knowledge of the impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition a nickel refinery is planned near Townsville in Queensland which will have a significant impact on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All parts of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - airsheds, watersheds and land - have certain capacities to stand use and abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, an <span class="highlight">environment</span> department is much more than a pollution control department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> embraces a whole host of items such as over-population, urban sprawl, litter, dirty air and water, mining, land use planning and flora and fauna conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is such a complex interaction of man, nature, technology and society we cannot just set up a bureaucracy and call it the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and expect it to solve our problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has a staff of 8 clerks one is an Engineer the remainder is without any skilled scientists or men of technology in that field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see this in New South Wales where 4 departments - the Department of Health, the Department of Local Government, the Department of Transport and the Department of Environmental Control - are fighting each other about who has the right to monitor and control motor vehicle emissions and to manage the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All decisions by government, by private companies and by individuals have environmental impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we must do is design a new model which ensures that when any decision is made it is an environmentally wise one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can attain such a goal if we first set up proper social and environmental goals to keep us on course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the existence of these ‘hidden links’ which we must recognise now when we talk about ‘the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ means virtually ‘the world’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a world where everything is connected to everything else, it can be very misleading to isolate ‘basic environmental factors’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What then is ‘the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Aurelio  Peccei, the founder of the Club of Rome expressed ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ in a systems way which embraces both natural and man-made components. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each subsystem or system is contained in a system of a higher order, which represents its <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must forever bury the notion that the ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ means clean water or air, depleting resources or anything in an absolute sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, let us consider its <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> of a wild animal can be expressed similarly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is the system upon which the subsystem depends for its maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three things which we must constantly keep in mind when we consider the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we cannot ‘isolate’ the basic factors of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must become system oriented in our thinking when we consider the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand what is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of any subsystem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That larger system is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the subsystem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must sit down and decide what kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> we want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should put all of them down as an optimum <span class="highlight">environment</span> statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An optimum <span class="highlight">environment</span> statement, can be used to provide the framework for policies of decentralisation just as it can for other policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An optimum <span class="highlight">environment</span> statement should be idealistic and be reached as much as possible by consensus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Commonwealth Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would be a suitable place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The optimum <span class="highlight">environment</span> statement should also include the rights of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can provide the legal basis for protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from man and his technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Man is now doing violence to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> at an increasingly alarming rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy for  a  subsystem to wreck the larger system of which it is a part, that is its <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it must become obvious that once we recognise that everything is interconnected in a systems way, that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be overloaded and destroyed, we must realise that our concepts of ‘freedom’ will have to undergo great changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if, ahead of time, we have agreed upon a set of environmental goals we will be better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House believe that in matters of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> everything is connected with everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to look at it nationally and globally and to make sure that we manage the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and I use that word ‘manage’ deliberately one cannot control the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; it can only be managed in this sector of planet earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and Minister in Charge of Tourist Activities  (Mr Howson)  spoke today on the important matter of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but there was no debate on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But with a population of less than 13 million in a land mass of some 3 million square miles our policies must be designed to fit in with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the population that we hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, in some areas development should be accelerated, provided that in the management of our hardwood forests sufficient emphasis is given always to conservation of flora and fauna and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When honourable members consider these aspects they should bear in mind the efforts that are being made by foresters to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be improved by the culture of forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support this Bill and the amendment moved by the Opposition which seeks to  protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> because irrespective of what the honourable member for McMillan says, this is an important phase of the timber industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must always keep an eye on environmental aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, from the environmental point of view, is highly irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week the Minister for the Enviornment  (Mr Howson)  when making a statement said that his Department would examine the environmental aspects of all legislation before being passed through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no consideration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill contains not one word about the large environmental impact of the policies contained in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sound environmental policy would ensure that with the passage of this legislation the loans will be used primarily for buying up farm land first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sound environmental policy would ensure that wood demand was reasonable and not excessive; for example, that packaging was minimised rather than maximised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sound environmental policy would tolerate the permanent alteration of natural ecosystems only after much thought about the very great ecological consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sound environmental policy would see that taxation deductions were no longer given for further land clearing on private land but be given for re afforestation of already cleared land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, these costs would be minute compared with the tremendous cost to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the present programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to me that there is considerable doubt whether the Bill in its present form is in the public interest on both <span class="highlight">environment</span> and economic grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ask what are the implications for the conservation of flora and fauna, water catchments, conservation of soil in respect of present policies; what basic <span class="highlight">environment</span> guidelines in terms of forestry policy should be laid down to ensure the wisest management of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on these bases, planning and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> aspect, that the Opposition has moved its amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer here to chip mill projects particularly, which have been approved by State authorities, sometimes doubtfully, and where there could be despoliation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been serious concern that the undertakings that were given that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> would not be unduly interfered with, that the scenic beauty of the headlands would be retained or at least restored to some degree do not seem to have been honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All through this situation we had firstly a Liberal Minister in charge of Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable W. C.

    <p>On 29th July my colleagues, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  and the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the  Chairman  of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs  (Dr Coombs)  and officers of my Department met with Aboriginal leaders in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sent him a telegram because all of the reports said that he and his colleague - I suppose that one can call the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  a colleague - were in Darwin or somewhere doing something else probably quite irrelevant, given the situation that had arisen in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing that I have been endeavouring to do as Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts is to improve the dialogue between the Government and the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having stated how I believe we shall be able to understand these needs more closely, I now wish to inform the House of what has taken place while I have been Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the very point that is being dealt with now by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee is responsible to the Minister for Supply for safety aspects of the use of testing of nuclear explosive devices in Australia, for evaluation of proposals by other countries to explode nuclear devices outside Australia which might give rise to increased levels of radioactivity in Australia, and for monitoring of levels of radioactivity in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> arising from activities with nuclear explosive devices either in this country or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to over emotionalise the aspect of the fallout from the French nuclear tests but I want to draw to the attention of the House some facts which have been stated by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in his statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spoke with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on a radio programme when he was in Stockholm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that when the New Zealand Government placed its resolution before the Stockholm conference the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who is now sitting at the table who represented the Australian Government opposed the New Zealand Government’s proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently at the environmental conference in Stockholm a resolution, which was much less appropriate than the one we voted in favour of and which also referred to the disarmament conference at the United Nations, was put before a committee at Stockholm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the resolution came into plenary session at the Stockholm conference on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, because we could not get it framed in accordance with the procedures we thought were proper and consistent with our attitude up to that time, we voted in favour of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Reid pointed out to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  what he calls the ‘conservative view’ stated on page 4 of this statement where these words appear: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Reid asked the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts what he had done or what anyone on behalf of the Australian Government had done to try to persuade the French to accept the Australian Government’s view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is still open for the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, we recognise - though the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  suggested that we do not - the idealism involved in any educative process, and not least in this area of very young lives and minds who have the capacity not only to be moulded by the influences of their <span class="highlight">environment</span> but who now it appears have also the mental capacity to be much more influenced by proper teaching than was previously thought to be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the Commonwealh has stated its position in a statement made by my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In co-operative bodies such as the Australian Minerals Council, the Australian Forestry Council and the Australian Water Resources Council, I have had the opportunity over the last year or so of studying with the States problems related to rational economic development of our resources and aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have any of these men been recruited and, if any have been appointed, are their efforts having any effect on preventing the damage that was being done to that <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I visited the area earlier this year, on a suggestion made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, because of a degree of vandalism that was taking place in the proposed national park area, lt was as a result of this visit that I decided to have set aside 1,250 square miles as a wildlife sanctuary, and my Department has agreed to appoint 5 rangers to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected until such time as the question of the proposed national park is settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Agreement has been reached between the mining companies which are prospecting over the area and the Government to contribute on a Si for $1 basis towards an environmental impact study to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> including the fauna and flora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be based on the need for scientific investigation to achieve breakthroughs to overcome the underlying problems of soil-plant-animal relationships that are presently reflected in practical farming problems in this <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the very action taken by the Government itself and the kind of action we have continually thought about are designed to ensure that so far as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the quality of life of people in the metropolitan and urban areas- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A man’s working <span class="highlight">environment</span> has to be treated as part of his total <span class="highlight">environment</span>, because a working man spends more than half his waking hours in the workshop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask all honourable members in the House - 1 do not care on what side of the House they sit - or any member of the general public who examines this Budget: Where does it contain any mention of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the problem of controlling urban land prices, the problem of housing in both the public and private sectors, the real problems of urban transport, the problems of trying to control the over-building of the central business districts of our capital cities by major insurance companies and foreign investors and the problem of providing sewerage in our cities, particularly in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Perth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This budgetary measure indicates how seriously the Government considers the problems of the cities and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24th May last, speaking on behalf of the Government, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  said that all Federal action would require an ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statement’ about future legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This tax on LPG indicates that decisions are made in the Treasury and to hell with the environmental consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is more, we will do it without building a huge monolithic <span class="highlight">environment</span> department and it will not act as a ‘big brother’ to other departments, the States, the municipalities or private industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I talk about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> I include those people who live in cities and whom, I believe should not be strangled by car exhaust or industry emissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has now embarked on one of the largest programmes it has ever undertaken in providing destroyers, a naval force that is able to look after the situation in our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly the archipelago to our north and in the seas to the east and west adjoining our coasts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also I would like to draw to the attention of the Government the work that is being done in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am pleased that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Howson)  is at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The educational theory and practice underlying this approach to primary school planning is the educators’ need for a physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which teaching can proceed flexibly and which can be readily and quickly adapted to different kinds of teaching and learning situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposal to introduce new integrated measures to help not only chronically ill patients in nursing homes, but also to assist aged infirm people who can be looked after in a home <span class="highlight">environment</span> will meet the support of all those Australians who have detected within our prosperous community a tendency for families to avoid their responsibilities to their elderly people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I believe that this is a remarkable and very valuable step forward in the concepts which have been introduced by this Government over recent years and it will have a profound effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the average family in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The crux of the company’s case was that continuation of the stable economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> created by the competitive 2-airline system was absolutely vital before the ATI board could involve its 50,000 investors in the substantial loan commitments needed for additional aircraft, the repayment of which would extend well past the present agreement expiry date of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we must get over to members of the community, as, I think, many of them already realise, is the fact that increased productivity is the key to all the things the community is striving for - improved education, better social services, a more pleasant <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion, I would like to express the personal satisfaction I received when the Royal Lifesaving Society of Australia and the Surf Lifesaving Association of Australia received an increase in the grants in aid from the Department responsible to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  who is now sitting at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as prices are concerned, the Government is seeking - through trade practices legislation and a review of the tariff - to promote a vigorous, competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my Department of Primary Industry is responsible for the general negotiations that take place within the International Whaling Commission it might be appropriate if I explained to the House that there was no inconsistency between the vote cast by my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts at Stockholm and the others made within the International Whaling Commission for the control of resources of whales around the oceans of the world, lt needs to be recognised that whaling is an industry which today has contracted significantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No word has been said about any submission on this matter having been taken to Cabinet and no action has been taken to deal with this important question of decentralisation, to provide for the development of this country and to locate people in country districts in order to give them the opportunity to live better and healthier lives in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which would be to their advantage and to the advantage of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would be foolish enough to try to predict with certainty what the situation will be throughout the world - and especially in our own region - in 10 years time except the members of the Labor Party who appear to have adopted the thinking that nothing can happen to us, and the devil take any of our neighbours who suddenly find themselves in a hostile <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I have no doubt that, if the tangible and intangible benefits of maintaining a high quality <span class="highlight">environment</span> were evaluated in monetary terms, the rate of return on capital invested would be extremely high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that on 24th May this year the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  stated that, when Commonwealth Government money was involved in anything that could have an environmental impact, an impact statement would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  whether any impact statement has been prepared by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, because Commonwealth money is being used for a project in a Commonwealth Ter ritory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: As the Navigation Act that he brought in last March did not cover this point and as the United Nations Conference on the Human Enviroment in June and the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council in July have stressed its urgency, how soon will this minute amendment to replace 3 words in existing Commonwealth legislation be introduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not quite sure of the circumstances in which my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, uses the term ‘impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I can say to the honourable gentleman is that the impact of pollution on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by this measure was most carefully weighed against the other side of the equation; that was the potential for the erosion in very great dimensions of the capacity of the Commonwealth, by means of tax revenue, to discharge the very many expenditure requirements upon the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He asked: What aspects of environmental impact had the government studied before making its decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could not really co-relate what the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  meant by an ‘impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the Minister who is supposed to represent the Aborigines of Australia - the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  - has not spoken in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This trend is accelerated by the deficiencies of services in many nursing homes, the lack of stimulation, the lack of an arousing <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the failure of the paramedical services to provide a stimulating challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to suggest that the Ministry for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts - this Ministry which is very ambiguous in many respects and which from the environmental standpoint hardly seems to have come down to any positive line of objectivity - should start to accept some responsibility in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is in the House at the moment, has consciously applied himself to this matter and whether in fact he concedes that it ought to be the responsibility and the prerogative of his Department to liaise with the Post Office in this case and indeed with many other Departments where there is a responsibility to determine whether an historical building, such as the Customs House in Sydney, is to remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The College could be successful providing we take a proper attitude towards the <span class="highlight">environment</span> there for these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has a superb regard for and has shown an awareness towards the problems of noise and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State’s reliance on the Commonwealth for funds gives the clue to the small amounts allocated to the new ministries of the Arts, <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a biological organism, he has evolved over millions of years in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> demanding physical mobility and endurance, yet in the last 50 years, Australians, by following the trend of other technologically advanced countries, have considerably reduced their daily energy expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is now alarming medical evidence which indicates that man’s inability to physically adapt to his changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> is causing many diseases of a degenerative nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without disputing this contention by the Minister I feel he should have put greater stress on the peculiar environmental conditions of the rural islands off Australia’s coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of the 3 large islands which are important rural producers and are farmed largely by soldier settlers is confronted by a unique set of environmental conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from these joint problems there are physical and biological problems produced by the distinctive character of an island <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the same month, on 24th May, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in a statement, entitled ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> - Commonwealth Policy and Achievements’, incorporated statements of the Government’s observations on the recommendations of the Senate Committee and concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly we find that the largest semigovernment authorities in Australia, the ones which have most conspicuously failed to meet the requirements of a civilised community, are to have no help from the Commonwealth as far as the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts is concerned and no help from the Commonwealth as far as the present Prime Minister is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can show the world how a sensible nation can go about the kind of development the modern world and the modern needs of man and the demands of his <span class="highlight">environment</span> require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of reference to the ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ in the originally proposed agreement does not mean that this important field has been ignored; in fact environmental aspects of forestry activities are very much in mind in the formulation of forestry programmes throughout Australia and the very expression ‘sound forestry . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>practices’ in paragraph 9 of the original agreement contemplated full recognition of the effects of forestry activities on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there are established in New South Wales and Victoria Ministries responsible especially for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Forestry Council, which recommended the softwood programme, has demonstrated a responsible attitude to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by endorsing a Forestry and Wood-based Industries Development Conference to be held in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conference will recognise the importance, not only of economic matters concerning forests and forest industries, but also social and environmental aspects of forestry and forest industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council has also established liaison with the newly formed <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government has no objection to including in the Agreement a form of words that emphasises the need to protect the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it would not appear desirable to dictate a precise procedure for the Forestry Council and the forest services to follow in undertaking a task to which they have diligently addressed themselves in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment that I have proposed to clause 9 of the Agreement will ensure that planting is carried out each year efficiently and in conformity with sound forestry and financial practices and that environmental factors are considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also recommended that similar special reference to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be considered in any future agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the environmental factors have to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In the clearing of timber regard must be had to ecological and environmental influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A consequence of the amendment will be that the Commonwealth will become more conscious of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I can tell the House that the Australian Transport Advisory Council has a sub-committee known as the Committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions which is made up of Commonwealth and State representatives of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, health, transport and national development portfolios. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is probably the first time - it will be only the first of many - that governments have been brought to task with regard to and reminded of the impact of certain legislation on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The absence ot reference to the ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ in the originally proposed agreement does not mean that this important field has been ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The forestry commissions probably would be as <span class="highlight">environment</span> minded as most people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, they would probably be the leaders in the environmental field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no matter how progressive the environmental people are they have to be open to criticism and there have been mistakes made by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, when one starts to deal with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> one should remember that everything is connected to everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, this will be just the first of many actions to be taken in this Parliament with regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is through the home <span class="highlight">environment</span>, through better housing and the obtaining of housing soon after marriage that we can assist families in this country to stay together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are being forced into this type of accommodation and this type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> because the Government, in bringing forward a homes savings scheme, does not recognise and does not even commence to understand the basic necessity of arresting this tremendous burden on the young people today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> made  a  statement in this House relating to impact statements, I caused a letter to  be  sent to each of  my  ministerial colleagues, over the signature of the permanent head of my Department, giving instructions that whenever the problem of <span class="highlight">environment</span> or pollution was involved in any submission to Cabinet there must be interdepartmental consideration and the results of that interdepartmental consideration must be mentioned in the Cabinet submission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instructions were given that, particularly when there was likely to be an environmental or pollution effect, a statement had to be attached to each one of the Cabinet submissions setting out the nature of the effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wrote to each of the Premiers informing them that whenever Commonwealth assistance was given to the States we would expect them to take into consideration the environmental and pollution impact of whatever activities were to be carried out  by  the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The original tax measures indicate how seriously this Government considers the problems of the cities and the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24th May last, speaking on behalf of the Government, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is now sitting on the front bench, made a statement that all Federal action would require an ‘environmental impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know what pressures are placed on the Government by the environmental bodies throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This tax on LPG indicates that decisions are made in the Treasury and to hell with the environmental consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will ensure that decisions take into account environmental factors, irrespective of who makes them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, we will do it without building a huge monolithic <span class="highlight">environment</span> department and it will not act as a big brother to other departments, the States, the municipalities or private industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has shown itself to be a complete washout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed tax would certainly have been a setback to those people who are interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and who, with knowledge gained from overseas, are concerned that we do not have in our cities a situation similar to that in cities such as Los Angeles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that my colleague the honourable member for Reid is most interested in the environmental aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>For over 12 years  Mr Fox  searched in vain for a site where he could recreate in authentic detail the living <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia’s first settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pattern which does not fit into the kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they must live and I think a good deal of imagination should be used to design a completely different kind of house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, the Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  and I were both members of a select committee which examined the grievances of the Aboriginal people of Yirrkala. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  that the statement he is criticising is the second reading speech by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the estimates of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, there is a provision under the Office of Aboriginal Affairs for consultation and liaison with Aboriginal panels and associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not even run by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  but the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will grow up in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is totally different from that in which their parents developed themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those Aboriginal people who created the Federal Council, who have kept it alive, who have been about and have carried on the battle sometimes in a most hostile <span class="highlight">environment</span>, ought to be given a great deal more respect even though they are grateful for the occasional assistance for fares and such things when it turns up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the paper issued by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  we see a list of houses to be built by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard an anthropologist say that this is the way in which they want to live and that a set <span class="highlight">environment</span> could be unhealthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They wish to place the whole of the burden on social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the suspicion is growing once again that the argument about social <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not quite enough, that there may be inherent differences which any amount of compensatory action in respect of social <span class="highlight">environment</span> may not eradicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last Thursday the right honourable gentleman amplified an earlier statement by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts on the subject of impact statements which the Government will require from Commonwealth departments and expect from State governments when questions of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and pollution are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A small overseas country entered this field, spent very large sums of money on the project and then abandoned it, recognising belatedly that it was not the kind of project that a country with its resources in a modern <span class="highlight">environment</span> should really have entered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not need to think too deeply to realise the deep social and psychological upsets that would occur in children who are in a completely different and foreign <span class="highlight">environment</span> with social conditions different from those that they have been used to and with an educational system that does not use their native tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recently returned from a visit to Europe during which I attended a conference in Vienna on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s approach in the preparation of the legislation has been to strike a balance between the need to regulate insurance companies and the preservation of the rights of those companies to carry on business in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as all Cabinet submissions are looked at to see their effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, so these submissions also should be looked at to see how they will affect decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is very hard to reconcile this new-found interest that the Government has in decentralisation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed the problems are starting to compound and people are recognising this in every walk of life and in every <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might mention at this stage that a great deal of credit for the success of Canberra - a success which was recently acknowledged at the United Nations Conference on Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in Stockholm - is attributable to the work of  Sir John  Overall as head of the National Capital Development Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put on record my thoughts about the real role of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts in a federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenged it to describe to this Parliament its concept of what should be the concern of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  on 24th May last in which he detailed the Department’s so-called duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the concept of such a department held by the Government is very limited and out of date and if I asked honourable members to state the first couple of items which came to their minds when I mentioned the word ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’, we could see what part of the problem is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many countries have tried to set up huge monolithic departments with the power to solve environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot put environmental problems under one bureaucratic roof, for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not a thing but a complex of interconnected natural and man-made items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a complex interconnected web in a state of constant change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is like depends upon the point from and time at which we view it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important is that an environmental programme be undertaken, no matter who regulates auto emissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts can investigate and write the guidelines to indicate what is environmentally wise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has a key role to play here to ensure that such sell-outs to industry do not occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guidelines which the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> can lay down are sets of rules which define environmentally-wise ways of doing anything; of building dams or roads or a new town; cleaning land, managing city air, planting forests, building and siting industries, designing transportation and maintaining natural ecosystems to allow evolution to continue, or managing our arid interior or our precious coastline, or harvesting wood, mining and exporting minerals, generating power or viewing the population policy, and many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Department can advocate these guidelines to other paris of the Government, to the States and local governments and to private industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These in turn should account to the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for their performance in meeting these guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department must have teeth to use but, hopefully, they should not have to be used too often, for I believe that when most people act they do not deliberately plan to plunder the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; they do it out of ignorance or because of special pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to the whole process is the socalled environmental impact statement assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in his paper of 24th May indicated that <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statements would be required of federally funded projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any environmental impact statements will be for Cabinet and bureaucratic eyes only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people to whom the <span class="highlight">environment</span> belongs will have no say in what is being done to it by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister in a reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition in this House on Tuesday last said that in his opinion the environmental impact statement should be made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a rebuke to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> who on 21st August in this House, in reply to a question by me, said that impact statements would not be available to the Australian public or to organisations but only to Government members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final impact statement sent to the Council on Environmental Quality must include all the public comments on the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional power Includes the environmental protection of Commonwealth territory, the environmental impact of interstate or international trade particularly the export of natural resources, the regulation of corporations now that quite a few issues have been cleared up by the High Court in the so called concrete pipes case, and certain other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In areas of environmental impact assessment which do not require Federal money or power and over which the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction the Commonwealth will act to work with the States for rational management and the protection of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in Australia we have many big environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts gave some leadership in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not got so far as to put 2 and 2 together and realise that this is absolutely the best means of achieving the reverse of his first objective* Perhaps some time he and the people who help him with these matters will put the whole thing together and decide whether they are going to go for balanced development so that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is seen in the perspective of economy and vice versa, or whether they are going to keep them absolutely separate and therefore almost totally meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the biggest problems that confronts this or any other government in doing something meaningful in the environmental area is to work with all the powers that be in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware that the initial attempts of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to enlist the cooperation of the States in a national intrusion, as it were, into this field were not universally acclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is fair to say now that the much criticised, in some ways, impact statements are in fact a very considerable move in the direction of a national framework for environmental awareness and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think people are aware that impact statements are designed to show what any given intended action may produce in the environmental sense, in particular what detrimental effects or what changes in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may be brought about by any direction of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to do, what the Minister has to do and what his Department has to do is to get into some reasonable sense of balance the kind of things we need to be done in the future in the environmental sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, in simple terms, the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> which involves things like air pollution, water pollution, perhaps the consequences of over-population, depletion of resources and matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, we have the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which aesthetics, interpretations, perception and the quality of life in a general sense are more likely to be involved, although both these facets-the physical and the social - add up to the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we will see that it is not long before the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts will be working towards national standards for a variety nf things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, all I can find has happened in a period of 3 years has been talk about what we might do, what we could do or what we should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are working on preserving their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we have all the problems of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the area about which I am speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he call for a report on the extent ot the financial problem and confer with the Suites and the authorities concerned to ensure a continuation of the work involved as a first priority to reduce pollution and protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-57-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do hope that in the coming 12 months this serious matter of beach erosion and the causes thereof will be referred to some coordinating authority, for example the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will realise, the Council is chaired by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, who is at the table, and the several States are represented by the appropriate State Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time does not allow honourable members to cover adequately the activities of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would just say that it is a very interesting fact that whereas the Labor Party has been saying for a very long time that all the ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation problems of Australia should be compounded into a responsibility of one monstrous, huge centralised organisation here in Canberra, this has never been, and never will be, I am sure, the policy of the Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time allowed to me 1 wish to concentrate on the environmental aspects of the estimates that are now before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so in some ways to rebut what the previous  speaker  the honourable member for Cook  (Mr Dobie)  just said, in that he has taken the concept of the Opposition as one of an overall structure dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> rather than an overall concept of what a Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> means and what it should deal with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span>, ecology, pollution and conservation are nice ‘in’ words at the present moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In examining the functions of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, I am afraid that its functions are far too nebulous and that they do not give us any clear guidelines as to what we are determining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the briefest of debates on the report presented to the Parliament on the United Nations Conference on Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> held in Stockholm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important conference that was held was the second International Parliamentary Conference on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which was held in Vienna this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should have a look at this total concept of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Minister should use his Department to encourage this sort of involvement of members of the Parliament and discussion of these wide issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 an Environmental Protection Authority was set up in Victoria and the pamphlet publicising the setting up of this authority is headed ‘Tomorrow and tomorrow and . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Tomorrow’ is right because despite the Clean Air Act of 1958 little has been done, and I have little confidence that anything will be done by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will pollute the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it might be wise for the political parties to put on every piece of paper they publish a message such as ‘Do not rubbish Australia’, ‘Dispose of this’ or Do not pollute your <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a more serious note, mention has been made of impact studies carried out by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual industrial process itself causes the pollution through the various chemical treatments of the wood which causes the release of effluent which pollutes the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> should be taking a hand in these matters because industry may not necessarily be solely responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must think of the environmental aspects of industry and other things in a total concept of national planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that we will see the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> really spelling these things out and being not a nebulous structure but something with real force and real effect in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although in the past a number of people have been concerned about the relationship between man and his <span class="highlight">environment</span>, about the utilisation and conservation of scarce resources, about the preservation of unique natural land forms and the conservation of the earth’s flora and fauna, only recently has this concern become widespread amongst the people of the developed countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in these countries, it is the popular thing to be ‘for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ and this to my mind is a very good thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 only wish that this concern to combat pollution was even more widespread, and that individuals did ail in their power, which is considerable, to stop polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by such mundane but effective acts as not throwing cans and bottles about indiscriminately, not Uttering the countryside wilh all sorts of garbage and, in fact, by behaving like people who care about the surroundings in which they and other people live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  President  Nixon said in his 1972 Environmental Message to Congress: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The starting point of environmental quality is in the hearts and minds of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their enthusiasm about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> spreads with a healthy contagion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past we have emphasised quantitative growth at the expense of qualitative growth; the failure to attempt to assess environmental effects when undertaking new developments; neglecting to account for the social costs of pollution; the increasing dependence on conveniences such as the car without due regard for the environmental effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But perhaps funda mentally we have had a lack of recognition of the concept, both nationally and internationally, of the interdependence of all the parts making up the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>V;n himself is an increasingly important part of this total equation, not only because of the absolute growth in the world’s population but also because of man’s increasing capacity to alter the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for both good and evil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures aimed at environmental protection are not necessarily divinely inspired and it could be that in some cases the cure is or could be worse than the complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To develop a new consciousness towards the problem of living in harmony with our <span class="highlight">environment</span> we need new knowledge, new attitudes new insights, not only through all levels of government - and here I would like to place special emphasis on the role of local government which has particular responsibilities particularly in city areas - but in the private sector as well, in the protessions, in industry of course, right through to the individual citizens themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need 2 things in the future  -  a healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a healthy economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The achievement of a healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> is dependent for its very lifeblood on a healthy economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this leads to my second warning, and this ls specifically directed at those who see the cause of our problems as being the growth economy and the onward march of science and technology and who advocate as a cure the restriction or abolition of our dependence on technology, the cutting bask of an economy based on growth and the introduction of extremely harsh environmental legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, as I have said already, the economy and environmental action are irretrievably intertwined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no expansion of output within the economy roughly equivalent to the cost of cleaning up the <span class="highlight">environment</span> then, of course, that cost can be met only by cutting down on other sectors of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way out of the dilemma, is to expand the economy, with its consequent risks to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to do so is to invite the slowing down or stopping of environmental action as a result of the backlash I have referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we must realise that cleaning up the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will need the development and application of costly technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it has often been suggested that harsh legislation should be introduced as the means whereby those polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be made to pay and pay dearly for their sins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is required is cooperative incentive based legislation, aimed at encouraging manufacturers to adopt new and worthwhile pollution methods aimed at encouraging individuals to keep in mind their effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Punitive laws have to be enforced if they are to have any effect, and in an area as widespread as environmental control the sheer size of the law enforcing agency necessary is frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, both companies and individuals secured worthwhile rewards - and this would almost automatically have to be economic - for acceptable environmental actions, the chances of widespread co-operation would be greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters have woken up to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the last few short weeks and they are falling damn short of what their responsibilities ought to be in regard to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Army  (Mr Katter),  who is attempting to interject, does nothing in administering his portfolio to ensure that certain near city areas are given back to local authorities in the interests of the people, and in the interests of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and recreational facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are local problems which require Federal assistance if we are to provide a worthwhile <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Party’s shadow Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  has promised that the Australian Labor Party would, when elected, give assistance to the purchase of major portions of the Hills face zone and thus provide recreational land and preserve this vital backdrop to the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman  - [Quorum formed] In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  1  would point out to the honourable member for Sturt who has just left his seat- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Government has done nothing about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee is in the process of preparing a report to the Parliament on the conservation of flora and fauna, the ecosystems, habitats, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amounts show that the Government is conscious of improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and doing something about it in a practical way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mining companies should be allowed to go into these areas but they must be forced to keep the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in first class order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is up to the government to see that these areas are policed and that companies such as Peko-Wallsend and Queensland Mines makes positive statements that they will protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that no-one will think that I am casting a reflection on the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further indication of the Government’s lack of interest is the fact that the same Minister has been given several other areas of ministerial responsibility - tourism, arts and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - to take up the bulk of his time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is utterly impossible and ridiculous for one Minister to try to handle the several responsibilities that the present Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has had placed upon him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(3.34)- During the winter recess it was my privilege to attend a conference which was held in Vienna to discuss matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that 32 nations were represented at this conference, which was held so soon after the Stockholm Conference, indicates the very great interest held by quite a number of governments of the world on matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the conclusions which was reached at Vienna was that the main thing wrong with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in developing countries is poverty and the main thing wrong with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in developed countries is pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the customer must be prepared to pay for a clean <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conference suggested that particular attention should be given to the interaction of urban and land uses with the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, notably wetlands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested by that conference that much more research should be conducted into projects having environmental impact and that individual countries should consider adopting methods in favour of antipollutant goods and services and against certain goods and services which contribute to pollution and that these be of a fiscal nature and involve tax concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the interests of a clean <span class="highlight">environment</span> we ought to give consideration to this aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that the matter before the Committee concerns Aborigines, the arts and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> because they represent 3 of the merging issues in Australia about which young people, particularly, are showing a great deal of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the Government has emerged so belatedly, in this pre-election period, with concern about Aboriginal welfare, environmental matters and many other things, it will help to compound the efforts that have been made by the Australian Labor Party to make these real issues for the whole country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> has lacked Commonwealth involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is staggering to think that the Commonwealth Government, which now has a Minister responsible for environmental affairs, has been a party to putting to the Parliament proposals that would have a deleterious effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently we have heard from the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, that there is to be a manifestation of governmental concern in the form of impact studies and subsequent statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that is to ensure that in respect of every developmental proposal a study will be made from an environmental standpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, does he think it is good for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Sydney for the Commonwealth to put 15,000 people in a narrow, bottle-necked isthmus which already suffers from great strain from the standpoint of the movement of traffic and the commuting that goes on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government have a genuine regard for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the extent that it will not allow that proposal to proceed and will replace it with a new idea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its first proposal would have contributed to the destruction of Sydney’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon I intend to confine my remarks in the debate, on these estimates to the matter of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most significant national developments during the 1960s was the widespread realisation by the public that the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live is declining, that the air and waters around us are becoming increasingly polluted and that much of the land upon which more and more of us live, is becoming increasingly congested with mounting burdens of waste disposal and with growing social problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>terms to know and use in daily conversation are ‘conservation’, ‘pollution’ and ‘ecology of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ecology of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> embraces all forms of life and its natural surroundings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the study of environments and the interdependence of life that exists in those environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another factor which is becoming an increasing problem in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is the population increase throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think it is of extreme importance to our future generations that we as a people do something to conserve our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, whether we do it individually or collectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must learn that the conservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> must be a joint venture between man and nature if we are to hand our country and our way of life over to future generations in good order and condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The challenge of preserving this <span class="highlight">environment</span> may well become one of man’s greatest tasks in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment by the Government of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is a significant step forward in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recently announced intention to introduce legislation for urban and regional development is another significant step forward in planning properly for the preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the sentiments that have been expressed in this debate by a number of other honourable members on the need to preserve our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and our ecology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter of ecology and <span class="highlight">environment</span> versus development, but rather of ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we should think in terms of ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken part in this debate today merely to sound the warning that it is not <span class="highlight">environment</span> versus development; rather it is ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that we have had such a useful series of speeches today and also last Thursday week on the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the speeches on the Department have generally concentrated on the importance of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is important that we have been able to set up an administrative structure that enables the Commonwealth to play its part in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The various piecemeal activities of several government departments must be lumped together so that the environmental policy reflects the <span class="highlight">environment</span> itself - a whole and integrated system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States of America, for example, has a problem solving agency - the Council of Environmental Quality - and a policy making agency - the Environmental Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 say to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  that we have an opportunity here to do likewise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a policy-making Department on matters of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition really has no clear conception as to how environmental machinery should be established in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both stressed the need for balance in environmental considerations and said that we must balance the needs of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> against the needs of the economy and try to see that the two march hand in hand together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not saying that there must be economic growth and that there must be care of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but rather that the two can be made to co-operate and not to fight against one another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, through the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, has established the means by which we can see that we do get this balance not only in relation to matters which are the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth but also in relation to those which are the responsibility of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been very great progress in the work of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that as a result of the announcement by both the Commonwealth Government and State governments of the polluter pay’ principle that industry is cooperating with governments in seeking solutions to <span class="highlight">environment</span> and pollution problems and that the governments and industry are working together to find better solutions than they have had in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is .also the danger that the courses we provide are- much too sophisticated for the kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which these young people are to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about the situation in Papua New Guinea and brought to our attention some of the very real changes which will occur in this area of our immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stresses and strains of growth are having an impact on the living conditions and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the entire Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Words like ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’, ‘ecology’, ‘conservation’ and ‘quality of life’ are all inwords today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Very early in its term of office the Western Australian Government established an environmental protection authority, and the Government has consistently acted on the basis of its recommendations even where, as in the postponement of the Pacminex refinery project, they were in conflict with other basic Government aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-But in environmental matters, as in all areas where costs are heavy, we will not get anywhere without Commonwealth involvement and commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 variables are: At what stage economic take-off occurs and how quickly that stage can be reached if enough money is infused into that local regional <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy for all of us in this Parliament and for members of State parliaments to say that we will build a magnificent concept of a new city, that we will develop a new region, that we will start where there are few people - perhaps 10,000 - and try by capital infusion to turn the area into the sort of <span class="highlight">environment</span> where people will be most fulfilled and happy in the years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we should do something to ease the older generation out of agriculture - and the abolition of the means test is of considerable significance here, with the property component so far adding to the immobility of older people in agriculture - and allow them to move into a nearby rural community where socially they are happier and they are still in their own <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, so that Australia is enabled to maintain its position as an industrialised nation in an international producing and trading <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is becoming increasingly competitive and sophisticated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently we have had much talk about decentralisation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - this new found love that the Government has - but why did it not apply some of these principles when it brought forward these proposals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what the’ Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  would say about this proposal if he were available to participate in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was any impact study made from an environmental standpoint? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, to whom I referred earlier, would be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express my concern firstly because I do not think I can see attached to the report of the Public Works Committee an environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  is sitting on the front bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24th May of this year he made a statement that where Commonwealth moneys were involved environmental impact statements would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under questioning from me about whether or not the environmental impact statements would be made public the Minister stated quite coldly that they would not be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following this matter up the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  in a question to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  which appears on page 1972 of Hansard of 27th September, asked about the environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that a Public Works Committee inquiry was held into the environmental aspect but I would like to know, with due respect to my colleagues on my side of the House who are members of the Committee and also to supporters of the Government who are members, what qualified environmentalist was on the Committee to give advice on the scientific evidence and to make his findings available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have environmental impact statements we want to see trained scientists in the field of ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> deal with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts interjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does a lot of talking about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but takes little action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not really know what pressures will be put on th; <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that he got on his feet and told us what he thought about environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No environmental impact statements was made in this place even though we made available the bridging finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want more detail from the Government on its attitude to making available Commonwealth money for projects which destroy the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly the proposal in regard to the Black Mountain area It is about time that more detail was mad: available to members of this Parliament, [f this is not forthcoming in the future this Government will certainly hear a’ great deal more from members on this side, at least until December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will take a while to get it moving but we hope that in regard to environmental aspects we will make available all the arguments, we will make public any documents which are available and we will make our decisions known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee heard detailed evidence from the environmentalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had <span class="highlight">environment</span> running out of our ears before the hearing concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard evidence on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> over a period of 3 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They weighed up the environmental problems and they weighed up the recommendations of the National Capital Development Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has just come into the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, on figures that I have revealed already by way of Press statements and so forth, there is a large discrepancy in regard to the purchase price of this property and what later appeared in Press statements and other statements by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts about this property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Department of the Interior to Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal land rights and the attitude displayed by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts are somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then this matter will be approached on a proper basis and not with interdepartmental jealousies as have occurred over this particular property where the Department of the Interior on the one hand, does not wish to see the property acquired by the Commonwealth and perhaps the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts wants to acquire the property and has to have some considerable interdepartmental argument with the Department of the Interior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall conclude and make 4 minutes of my time available to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts so that he can answer the questions which I have put to him in regard to the transaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I told the House when introducing the Aged Persons Homes Bill recently, one of the most important aspects of this year’s comprehensive programme to improve the health and welfare of aged people is to encourage and assist people who might otherwise be admitted prematurely or unnecessarily to nursing homes or other similar institutions to remain in their domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span> for as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In subsequent years the Commission has refined its activities to comparing the fiscal efforts as between States, or in the broader term, taking into account the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the people in a State operate, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they pay taxes, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they show a propensity to pay certain taxes as compared with other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, is supplementary to the one asked by the honourable member for Sturt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the way the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is being protected at the present time this matter is understandably most important now if we do not want a forest cf overhead telephone and electricity wires to deface the landscape and skyscape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is short-sightedness on the part of the developer to overground wires in an area in which he is trying to sell land because the poles will go up, the wires will go up and there will be a considerable defacement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should ask the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  and the State <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministers responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that honourable members and the people of Australia have seen pictures of Tokyo, Osaka and I suppose, to some extent Los Angeles, where pollution and defacement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are almost incredible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the question of <span class="highlight">environment</span> arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I wish to make is that because the Department has lowered its standards in permitting overhead cables once again or in abandoning the former requirement that cables had to be put underground, the Department is making it so much more difficult to have a pleasant <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if one looks at the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, if one looks at the problems of pollution, one could say the same thing in respect of everything that is infecting and polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> affects more than just the people with telephones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note the newly found concern of the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Bate)  for the northern part of his electorate, but I think the more significant factor about this debate is the failure of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When civilised mon looks out from the padded cell of urban life, what a destruction of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> he would see if only his eyes had not become too narrowly focused on his house, motor car, golf course, his cocktail bar and his television set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a lot more important than the Postmaster-General has been prepared to concede in the discussion today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be reasonable at least to say that whereas it might be expensive to put things underground in Collins St Melbourne or in George St, Sydney, in new communities about which there has been a lot of talk recently we will lay out our requirements as a department which has some concern with preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the aesthetic standards in Canberra are such that even external tele.vicion antennas are not allowed and householders must use internal antennas to prevent intrusion into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of a very unsatisfactory feature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will ensure that all the necessary components of government planning, such as transportation, land use, housing, industry, tariff and population planning and environmental impact assessment, are joined in the national effort to achieve our goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The department, which will have both technical and research staff, will integrate the activities of such bodies as the Bureau of Transport Economics, the Bureau of Roads, the Departments of Shipping and Transport, Interior, Works, <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Natural Resources, Primary and Secondary Industry, Civil Aviation and others insofar as they affect urban development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we will use <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact assessments and <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statements to ensure that all this is done in the best interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are being asked to believe that the Country Party is not just a mouthpiece of the big grazing and farming interests but has always been concerned with the health, education, housing and social welfare of Australians and is dedicated to solving the growing problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, namely urban congestion pollution, conservation and decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, in the last few months, his Government has adopted or gone some way towards adopting Labor Party policies on participatory schemes for nursing homes, which are the responsibility of the department he represents today, a needs concept in regard to Commonwealth secondary school scholarships, foreign ownership, the abolition of the means test, a national superannuation inquiry, a poverty inquiry and urban affairs, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like him to make an impact statement on the failure of the Government to enact the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill and on the failure of the Government to take any serious action to control the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recognised that wildlife conservation is only a part of a much larger issue of conservation, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that retention of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is essential to man’s survival, not only that of wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During its inquiry the Committee became: aware of the very great concern of a large number of individuals about a wide range of environmental and conservation matters, many of them outside the scope of this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore support the creation of a standing committee of this House to inquire into and report on matters of conservation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> referred to ir by the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>actual, name of the Committee was in some sense misleading in that a select committee on wildlife conservation allowed a number of our fellow members, departmental officials and a number of the general public to feel that many things would be pushed aside, when in fact what this committee was dealing with was the relationship of man to his natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the terms of reference really restricted our comment on the question of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> and marine national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are we dealing with land use and with man and his relationship to his natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> but we are dealing also with some of the aesthetic values for tourism, recreation and enjoyment of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the outcome of the report will be a better understanding by the Parliament and the country of the relations of man and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee also recommended that the Post Office should acquire additional land adjacent to the near complex to improve the setting of the building and the amenity of its immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>, including car parking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the people who live in those suburbs and who will live there have every right of call on their environmental surroundings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1970s and in the latter part of the 1960s there has been an increase in the number of people who care about and look around at what is being done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you live on the other side of Brisbane  or  in the outer suburbs this is not a problem; but in this part of Brisbane there is an opportunity to make a contribution to the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by ensuring that conditions will be satisfactory not only for the people who will work in this new building but also for those who have to live near this proposed new building, and it is on their behalf that I speak today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Committee believed that it is important to improve the setting of the building and the amenity of its immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>, including car parking, we recommend that a more positive approach be adopted and that the Post Office acquire additional land adjacent to the new complex for these purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>me in this debate I should, like to discuss something which relates particularly tq , my own portfolio, namely, the .environmental impact statement technique which we have proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I concede quite frankly that the previous Government had adopted the concept of environmental impact statements designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; but its proposals had not in fact reached the implementation stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its idea was that the appropriate departments would prepare these statements and the statements would be called for if there appeared to be anything’ in a project which impinged on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should I consider that a project concerns the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, then I have a discretionary power to call for an impact statement; but after January of next year that discretionary power will no longer exist and the statement will be automatically expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is fitting that in the Speech, the Governor-General, as the Queen’s representative, should echo the words of Prince Phillip when His Highness, as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said that the Lake Pedder case marked the end of Australia’s pioneering days and ushered in a new phase of conscious concern for the long term future of our national and human <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The native genius of our people will be given full play to bring about a society, an <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a forward looking nationalism that is our birthright and our destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have sufficient faith in the youth of Australia to believe that it will protect the nation, its people, its <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its future much more effectively than have conservative governments over the past 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Youth has shown through its actions that it is concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its protection and is prepared to act against pollution of our waters and the atmosphere, lt is genuinely concerned about peace in the world and it is deeply interested in the survival of this planet and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to sustaining their idealism is more direct and effective action on the problems about which young people are concerned: the problems of the cities, of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, of racial injustice, of irrelevant and outmoded teachings, of overpopulation, of poverty, of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see it in the strong participation of youth in what are regarded as the concern’ or the ‘life quality’ issues in our society, for example, the elimination of poverty, concern for those persons unable to adjust to a complex society, the socially handicapped, the preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the generation of better cultural and educational facilities, and interest in the wellbeing of people in other countries and aid for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Five to 10 years spent in a stimulating <span class="highlight">environment</span> with job satisfaction leads many women to have expectations which did not exist with prior generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Describing population growth as one of the world’s dominant problems, he said it was tied up with such problems as economic development, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, urbanisation - to use that terrible word mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition - and unemployment, and that to solve these problems it was necessary to solve the population problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Hunter tonight had the hide to criticise the wine industry and to accuse it of ingratitude when, in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of cost increases of that magnitude, the industry increased its prices, despite the fact that the present Government had made this gesture in relation to the removal of the excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They need housing which blends with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, suits their purposes and allows them to make adjustments if they wish to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this respect, I wish to quote from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which inquired into the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the area of the proposed site for the refinery a joint study has been undertaken by the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of the Humanities and the Australian Academy of Social Sciences with the 3 Federal Departments of Urban and Regional Development, Science, and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and the New South Wales Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, one is the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable members that under the last Administration the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was almost the ministry of odds and sods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the problems we face in this aspect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We continued to make our opposition known and at the Stockholm Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> we sought to promote  a  form of resolution which would mobilise the greatest number of delegations in opposing atmospheric nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1st August last year we announced at the fourth session of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and Ocean Floor, that, with 11 other countries, we would be sponsoring a resolution declaring that no further nuclear weapons tests likely to contribute to the contamination of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our protests continued to escalate, culminating with our cosponsoring of a resolution with 12 other sponsors inviting the General Assembly of the United Nations to declare itself in favour of 2 main objectives: Firstly, a halt to all atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific region or anywhere else in the world, and universal support for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963; and secondly, the suspension of all nuclear weapons tests in all environments and the negotiation of a treaty banning all such tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also emphasises that incentives for decentralised development will be effective only if the total economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the decentralised locality is taken into account and that businessmen with first-hand experience of decentralised development will need to be brought into consultation with State and Federal authorities at an early stage to ensure that basic commercial considerations are not overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These changes flow not only from statements, which have been referred to, which were made by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  or the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr Cairns),  who referred to maniacs in the White House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am interested because as Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> I was invited to visit the area and see what was involved, and I will make no more comments on the possible outcome of that inquiry at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the question about whether we would use our powers to prevent the export of the products of mining, it has already been indicated by the Minister for Minerals and Energy that in cases when the national interest is best served by steps like that we will certainly take them, and in cases where it is necessary to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that decision will be taken only after a very careful consideration of all the factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the concept of environmental impact statements is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover the incidence of problems encountered by the member is not directly related to the number of voters in an electorate but to the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> that produces these problems and to the alternative avenues of redress open to the electorate - a mixture of lobbying power and wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the response will be taken further, not only to look at the school <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also to look at the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the children who are now in part the Minister’s concern but still significantly the responsibility of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Cost comprehends also values for any deterioration of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, for noise, for the loss of an open space area, for the effects upon rural industries, for the costs of new urbanisation and for many other ‘disbenefits’ which might be imposed upon people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential, therefore, that the benefit-cost study has sufficient freedom to produce ultimately a selection of the best site having regard, on the one hand, to the community’s need for efficient air transport services, and on the other, to its desire to avoid unnecessary economic or environmental penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will help it to find that role by removing its most objectionable features and developing those conciliatory features most useful in today’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This means that the complex road transport system involving the vehicle, the road <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the road user and his social <span class="highlight">environment</span> is working with a fair degree of efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we must provide an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which a vehicle can travel properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>environmental aspects of legislative and administrative measures which ought to be taken in order to ensure the wise and effective management of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and of Australia’s natural resources and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>such other matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation and the management of Australia’s natural resources as are referred to it by- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Select committees of both Houses, concentrating on environmental issues, have performed a valuable service to both the Parliament and the people of Australia in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that this be achieved by the establishment of a Joint Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of a Standing Committee rather than a series of select committees should facilitate the timely consideration of environmental issues as they arise, thereby strengthening Parliament’s role in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In moving for the establishment of this Committee I am conscious of the great many environmental problems that must be both faced and solved if the future citizens of this country are to enjoy the kind of life that so many of us take for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Joint Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would, in my view, provide a most effective means of providing for the full involvement of Parliament in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the first Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation it gives me pleasure to commend this motion to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> involves difficulties, and the more inquiry there can be in a central way, the more information that is given to members of Parliament and the more experience gained from listening to experts that we have, the better it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time 25 of the divisions were separately concerned with particular matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He looked at all federal submissions to see their effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in effect made an impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that they were then setting up something that we do not have here, a department of protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> under a  Mr Ruckelshaus,  who was taken from the Attorney-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a young lawyer in his thirties who was setting up this department with about 16,000 officers to police the enforcement of all environmental laws throughout America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had particularly close association with the New South Wales Government in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in my own electorate, particularly as it affects the Parramatta River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in point of fact, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in New South Wales,  Mr Beale,  and the Minister for Health,  Mr Jago,  both of whom have responsibilities in this area, had in fact done considerable studies on the river and they received the co-operation of business to a considerable degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I commend the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and the Government for moving for the establishment of this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a very good reason why very many more people are conscious of pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> now than there were 5 or 6 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the population of the world increases very rapidly we have to be conscious of the fact that we are making an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that will be there for generations to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People are entitled to live in a clean <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but if they want to live in a clean <span class="highlight">environment</span> they ought to be prepared to pay for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a committee such as has been set up could act as a watchdog for a clean <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a poor <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to bring up families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pitiful to see people being taken away from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they have lived for up to 60 and 70 years in many cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are taken from the people they know and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that they have loved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>4 of the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee entitled ‘Strontinm-90 and Caesium-137 in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> during 1970 and some results for 1971’ compiled September 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February 1973, I requested the Australian Academy of Science to report to me on ‘the actual or potential harm to Australia, including its human and animal population, its resources and <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from the explosion of nuclear devices in the atmosphere, underwater, or on or near the surface of the earth, with particular regard to the past and prospective explosions by France in the Pacific’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will note that in the foreword to the reports of the AWTSC it is stated that the AWTSC is responsible for safety aspects of the use or testing of nuclear explosive devices in Australia; evaluation of proposals by other countries to explode nuclear devices outside Australia which might give rise to increased levels of radioactivity in Australia; and monitoring of levels of radioactivity in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> arising from activities with nuclear explosive devices either in this country or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A new institution to be known as the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council will be established and this Council will be the advisory body to the Government on the effects of ionising radiation on the Australian population and <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Council will report to the Government through my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who will in future table its reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were part of the great Liberal plan that proceeded despite the desperate opposition of the Labor Party, to leave in their wake destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, incalculable social disruption by the bulldozing of houses and the uprooting of people in many cases after a lifetime in the locality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  made it clear that this legislation is only to enable assistance to be provided for work on 3 creeks flowing into the ocean south of the Tweed River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has stated that there is no intention to vary the Act or its method of operation, but the opportunity to say a few words on flood mitigation in general should not be let pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is especially so when we are told by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  that in order that objectives endorsed by the Water Resources Council may be achieved the Government is making available $15.1m by way of grant to the States for planned programs in the next 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  for the interest he has shown in this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has supplied the following answer: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no local investigation conducted specifically on its effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> However, the likely effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in its use on cotton crops would be: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the Bill contains proposals which are designed to weaken our conciliation and arbitration processes and which will seriously impede the Commission from dealing effectively with problems now experienced in the contemporary industrial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is certainly no way in which to bring about a better industrial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all Parties the main issue is to preserve a safe and secure <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They reaffirmed their strong opposition to these tests which exposed their peoples as well as their <span class="highlight">environment</span> to radioactive fallout against their wishes and without benefit to them, and which demonstrated deplorable indifference to their future well being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is to be recognised that these are possibilities and that the conclusions reached are subject to qualification, nevertheless, it should be selfevident that any pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> carrying with it the possibility of endangering human life and welfare, should be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that many people, having been encouraged to do so, go to the trouble of disposing of cans in a way which allows recycling in the belief that they are assisting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the conservation of resources, will the Minister investigate the allegations and expose the practice if it proves to be nothing more than an advertising gimmick? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, these trends must result in a weakening of those institutions - marriage and the family - which provide the best <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the upbringing of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  who is a doctor of medicine and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in the Federal Government and a strong supporter of the Bill, has been honest enough to say in the Press on 17th November 1972: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a greater awareness these days of the need for conservation of our resources and preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and there is much more urgency to find and adopt suitable methods to prevent or control pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particular attention will be directed towards ensuring the conservation and preservation of our natural resources and of the marine and associated environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for such a title is particularly important in the search for minerals in a relatively new and unknown <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our main aim will continue to be that this legislation shall encourage efficient and adequate exploration and exploitation of our off-shore resources and at the same time control operations in such a way as to ensure the conservation of our natural resources and the preservation of our marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the common good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that on the Commission or the advisory committee there should be at least 2 persons who have a specialised and expert knowledge of <span class="highlight">environment</span> preservation and of conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the planning of new cities it is essential to consider the effect of specific proposals on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This approach, and occasional interdepartmental consultations with environmentalists as planning was proceeding, would be much better than waiting until plans were well advanced before consulting the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and those with specialised knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is fundamental that people’s behaviour is determined by their social <span class="highlight">environment</span> - by their domestic and physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which people live has a very great effect on their communal and individual behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is what to do about improving the suburban and metropolitan <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the major capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will, however, have an important effect on the community by providing a different type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> where people may go and live and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is part of the whole awareness of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is occurring increasingly throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation been drawn to the high capital cost to industry of the installation of effective air pollution control equipment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the whole matter is in the melting pot and is being considered by the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council and its various committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We already have that on the Darling Downs without creating an artificial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I shall let that point go for the time being and in the minute that I have remaining to me I sum up by saying that I hope this House will take note of the fact that, in a low rainfall area with no catchment available next door, regional complexes should not be built upstream without assurances to the people who live downstream in towns and around irrigation systems or who are dependent on this water, as in the case of people living in a capital city, that proper precautions have been taken and that there has been an agreement between a disinterested State government and a Federal government which should be vitally concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the interests of the people downstream, to make sure that those waters reach those people in a pure state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In foreshadowing this amendment the right honourable member for Higgins said that he believed that there should be on the Advisory Committee at least  2  persons who had a specialised and expert knowledge of preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member for Higgins wants the Committee to accept this amendment so that the Government in its wisdom will have the opportunity of appointing to the Advisory Committee 2 professional environmentalists or experts in conservation, a situation which he has said, and which I agree, is lacking under the present constitution of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt at all that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren),  being such a renowned if amateurish enthusiast about matters of conservation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will enthusiastically accept the amendment I have moved on behalf of the right honourable member for Higgins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite frankly any different behaviour on the part of someone who speaks so feelingly about environmental and conservation matters, as does the Minister, would be difficult to countenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fairness to the previous Government, I think I should say that Professor Walsh is not just close to being an environmentalist but is in fact an environmentalist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Walsh is  Chairman  of the Great Barrier Reef Study Committee of the Australian Academy of Science,  Chairman  of the Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to the Australian Government through the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Chairman  of the Research Advisory Committee on the Crown of Thorns, past  Chairman  of the Joint CommonwealthQueensland Crown of Thorns Starfish Inquiry and a member of the Immigration Planning Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister for Urban and Regional Development introduced this Bill amending the National Urban and Regional Development Act of 1972 he foreshadowed a new federalism within which the Commonwealth Government, the States and in particular local government authorities will be able to develop, in co-operation, that excellance of urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which increasingly Australians aspire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I need mention only one particular aspect, and that is that big industry and rapid economic growth impinging on a finite <span class="highlight">environment</span> necessarily spells pollution in a big and accelerating way, in the absence of a vigorous government policy to combat it and so maintain and in some cases restore the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the quality of Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against the background of your difficulties,  Mr Minister,  in accommodating the many demands of your colleagues for greater expenditure in the emerging situation of overfull employment, I refer to an estimate by economist Kenneth Davidson in yesterday’s ‘Australian’, that over $4m could be saved if the Black Mountain tower project were replaced by an alternative scheme which is acceptable to the National Capital Development Commission, I gather, would fully satisfy the Postmaster-General’s requirements and would be acceptable to those concerned for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, there was no proper explanation of Government policy given to this House in the form of ministerial statements in many significant areas of Government policy - areas of selfproclaimed Government concern - such as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation, urban and regional development and, of course, a field very dear to the heart of the Leader of the House, immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We and our advisers do not at present foresee any deterioration in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that would involve consideration of the commitment of our defence force to military operations to protect Australia’s security or strategic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The favourable developments in the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that I have outlined strongly support our view that Australia is unlikely to come under strategic pressure or military threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The naval component has the type of units which contribute - especially in conjunction with maritime patrol aircraft and aircraft providing strike attack and defence - to meeting the appropriate fundamental requirements for the protection of Australia and its immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could, in the present strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, deter to a great extent any minor harassment and interference with Australian sovereign control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the teachers will be asked to get through to the Aborigines the importance of respecting their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it through to the young Aborigines and Europeans that they must respect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> because we see it ruined from top to bottom by people of various ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We see the <span class="highlight">environment</span> burnt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points that was put to us on the Standing Committee years ago was that, if we put the new parliament house in the centre of Camp Hill, we would develop a controlled <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact, Australia is not a controlled <span class="highlight">environment</span>; this country is one of the limitless environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to do today is to join my colleagues the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and to make up a troika, if you like - although some would prefer to call it a trinity - of ministerial backing and support for the point of view put very capably by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development not just in the House today by way of a competent speech but also in his very informative and stimulating document entitled ‘New and Permanent Parliament House Feasibility Study’ which has been circulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And finally, what is its relationship to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may sound a mundane subject to many people but we all know that the lack of proper sewerage in our large urban areas has had a very deleterious effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> around our cities and in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The father learns some English at work but when the child goes back to the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> there is probably often tension and difficulty if there is an attempt to speak English because the mother does not understand and does not want to be left out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So in the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> there is a reversion to the native tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in this kind of home and this kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> there are potential problems which will be difficult to overcome and which will need, as I have said, something going beyond the school boundaries - something that reaches out into the home and tries to establish a close link between the home and the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation told the House last Thursday the report of the committee inquiring into the salinity problems of the Murray will be received within the next few days and is due to be considered by the Ministers of the 4 governments concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall how the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  as Prime Minister and my predecessor in Casey, as Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts endeavoured, in the parlance of the day, to de-Gortonise this project along with many other projects in a manner that was highly disruptive to the unity of the Liberal Party and damaging to its electoral prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 8 September 1971 the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts said in answer to a question without notice from the honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley): <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>within recent weeks I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, and I have pointed out to him that he is to proceed as quickly as possible to collect all the evidence that becomes available to him so that the proposal can be presented to the Government well before the next Budget and not necessarily therefore in a Budget context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister, before establishing a group of Ministers chaired by the Treasurer to handle the matter of the national film and television training school, advise the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts of his intention to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 April 1972 the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts announced that the Government had received a third report from the Interim Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have heard the then Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts talk at the time one might have supposed that Australia had no film industry and that there would have been no opening for the graduates of the school other than in our limited number of television studios. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members in the House who wanted to have a little morning doze would have been indebted to the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews)  for his monotonous, archaic monologue which seemed to be devoted more primarily to taking apart the former honourable member for Casey who was Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One great advantage would be in the saving of lives and another would be in the preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> by use of a system to dial a vehicle and then to dial the destination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Diamond Valley has so rightly said, it is essential to try to preserve the orderly <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the ANU and to protect it from undue encroachment of traffic on the campus itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that this has greatly beautified the campus and although most of the students are enthusiastic supporters of the improvement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> they have some reservations about these happenings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, upon notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a social <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a place away from the home or hostel with which they can identify; where they can make friends and feel that they have a purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people are now saying that growth is opposed to quality; that if we have growth in the Australian economy we cannot have quality in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in the cities and in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe that growth is essential to quality of life in Australia, quality in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, quality in welfare services and quality in compassion for those who need assistance and those who need help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget breaks new ground in the areas of expenditure designed to overcome the tremendous pressures of life in our cities, after years of tedious repetition of Budgets that showed no imagination and no ability to meet the needs of this rapidly changing social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It neglected to provide an adequate response to the major quality of life issues such as the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, conservation and urban improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer told the Parliament that the Government would support a wide range of activities in the fields of environmental protection and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental protection is an endeavour which has been conspicuous for its neglect by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does the Budget make an inadequate allowance for environmental improvement but the Minister whose area of responsibility is directly involved has yet to make any statement to this House outlining his activities during the past 9 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And in spite of the unprecedented number of Bills introduced we have yet to see a single <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statement tabled in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has been an abject failure in his portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian environmentalists in all the groups in which they are active will be rightly disappointed with the meagre provisions this Budget makes for the vital concerns of environmental improvement and conservation and its promises and pledges in the area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable gentlemen sitting opposite know full well, the promises and pledges have been dishonoured by lack of activity in the ministerial portfolio in which the <span class="highlight">environment</span> has become the lost cause of the Labor Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They ask: ‘What is being done about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a decision for somebody who is motivated by profit and personal gain rather than by a desire to see the benefit that may flow to the community or to safeguard against the harm that could be done to it and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> ‘by his actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had the previous Government been returned at the last Federal election the situation would have been completely out of hand and the whole <span class="highlight">environment</span> could have been irreparably destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People were living in slums and a computer or some boffin suggested that the cheapest, most efficient way to solve that problem was to tear the slums down and erect high rise flats in their place without thinking for one moment of the impact of that on the individual concerned and without thinking about the kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, both social and other, of the child living on the 31st storey of a 32-storey high rise flat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objection is not so much that the Budget tries to do too much, but that it fries to do too much too soon in an economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> calling for restraint, and leadership in restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third point I want to make is that we are not raising this matter merely in the hope that somebody may be listening to the broadcast of these proceedings; we are raising it because we are concerned about the damage that can be done to the ordinary person’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>, comfort and quality of life - I have to use that phrase again - if an airport is established at Galston, just as we were concerned about the Mascot proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was it one that we would consider as perhaps we might consider an environmental study by a joint committee comprising members drawn from both sides of this House which was established to look into the damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> done by this proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until this Budget was presented the economy had been operating in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> largely determined by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some are being forced to abandon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of their choice, to leave their homes and to move many miles away in their evening years and either make new friends or perhaps spend their fast years in loneliness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having in mind the divisive effects of expressways on neighbourhoods and the impact of new major road systems on the overall <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I ask: In the preparation of the proposed Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement for the coming 5-year period 1974-79, has provision been made for an assessment of the social and economic impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of new major road systems to be built in that period and will provision be made for the Australian Government to participate in such assessments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not satisfied with the manner in which the States are constructing freeways without having regard to the effects of those freeways on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in future,when money allocated by the Australian Government is used for road construction the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be considered and the social effects of the freeways or main roads will be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the construction of that road is not commenced before 30 June next, before we allocate any money to it we will take into consideration the effects of the highway on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - on the Black Butt Reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion, I believe, is misdirected and inadequate because it tends to look at fertility control and abortion in isolation from the complex of interpersonal relationships, and it is an inquiry into fertility control and not into sexual responsibility in its wider sense grounded in the total growth of a person in the entire social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A positive program for an inquiry that could be expected to produce results that could be acted upon would encompass a study of the extent of existing educating programs and the need to provide a sound basis in the fundamentals of interpersonal relationships and of personality development in the context of the Australian social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally, the Minister’s abrasive and inflammatory approach to the industrial <span class="highlight">environment</span> has had the effect of doubling the amount of wages lost through industrial disputes for the first 9 months of this year as compared with the same period last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, as the Opposition’s spokesman for industrial relations, the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  has stated, the Opposition’s attitude to this Bill is determined by its analysis of what best serve the legitimate interests of the principal parties in the industrial <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the public at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable P.

    <p>We find exactly the same arguments available to us as apply to the aged people; that is, if it is desirable in the interest of the aged person to remain within a home <span class="highlight">environment</span> rather than an institutional <span class="highlight">environment</span>, or if one wants to be a bit more callous about it and simply look at the economic argument that even from the public point of view it is cheaper to keep a patient in those circumstances out of hospital rather than in hospital, I cannot for the life of me see how either of those arguments can apply to the person who reaches 65 years of age but not to one who has not reached that age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the new Minister for the Capital Territory is able to get some assistance, if necessary, from his colleague the present Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in order to get rid of this very nasty nuisance which at times causes a large area of Canberra to be covered in smoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increased traffic would kill off the city, pollute the air and do nothing to enhance the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the living standards of people generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently when one is able to report that there is somewhere at least where a few certain aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> have improved there are many cynics who would comment that such a thing is unlikely, if not impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One section of the new 14 point <span class="highlight">environment</span> platform of the Australian Labor Party, which was approved at its 1973 Federal Conference at Surfers Paradise, is ‘regulate toxic or indestructible materials by the development of standards for ambient air quality, water quality, ocean release of materials and the land disposal of solid and liquid waste and by the development of integrated programs at all levels of government under the leadership of the Australian Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report says that  Mr Dexter’s  letter to  Dr Coombs  related to evidence to be given to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the House or in this case the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation be regarded as being defeated in getting at all the facts and all the truth of the matter which they were examining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might also help Japan to avoid further difficulties with her trade balance as well as ease her critical environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First, there is a need to prevent pollution, conserve our resources and protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> even in the most remote areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not import pollution into Australia, nor will we dispose of our resources too fast or to the highest short term bidder, nor will we erode our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and transform it into holes, cuts and gashes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So it seems to me that, within the frame work of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we should apply ourselves in a very real sense to town planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deal with this concept we will have to have people who can not only look after the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in a way to be admired but who can also apply themselves to seeing what trees along the sides of the roads may be hazards and will have to be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government took no decision on the matter because it was swayed at that time by the objections from the then Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> that certain studies should be carried out before the previous Government acquired it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has taken full account of the views of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, and agreement has been reached at the interdepartmental level that the Government acquire the land but that the overall urban development for the plan of the area be subject to later consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This consideration will be based upon reports and studies, at least one of which meets the points raised by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, how can environmental groups do other than busy themselves in fighting rearguard actions if the public is unaware of proposals likely to prejudice the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what way is it intended to involve the affected public or the public in general in the decision-making process ‘ so that the need for rearguard actions to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the use of the Environmental Impact Statement procedure, environmental considerations including land use are receiving greater attention in decision making than they did previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is currently investigating the question of land use planning in Australia, and my Department is examining ways in which better decisions on land use can be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We and our advisers at the present time do not foresee any deterioration in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that would involve consideration of the commitment of our forces to military operations to protect Australia’s security or strategic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To me it is rather significant and extraordinary that this motion has been seconded by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in the atmosphere which exists in the community today because I do not know of any subject that tends more to mora] pollution than homosexuality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation provides that the Commission will be required not only to consider the immediate circumstances of an inquiry and the consequences for an industry of assistance that might be sought, or which might already exist and is sought to be reduced or abolished, but it will also be required to consider the following matters: The allocation of national resources, in itself a vast consideration and a tremendous responsibility to be removed from this Parliament and the Government and given to a statutory body without direct responsibilities to the people; full employment; price stability; external balance; conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; the interests of consumers; national economic policy; and trade policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have created an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which there has been built up over past years a large and sophisticated manufacturing sector and in which there was every reason for confidence in the future that the growth and progress of manufacturing industry would continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Manufacturers need to feel confident that their investment and planning decisions will be able to develop in a constant <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the performance of its functions, the Commission shall have regard to the desire of the Australian Government, in pursuing the general objectives of national economic and social policy and urban and regional development, to improve and promote the well-being of the people of Australia, with full employment, stability in the general level of prices, viability in external economic relations, conservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and rising and generally enjoyed standards of living, and, in particular, to the desire of the Australian Government to - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>facilitate adjustment to changes in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> by industries and persons affected by those changes; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what it wants to delete -  conservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and rising and generally enjoyed standards of living - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>facilitate adjustment to changes in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> by industries and persons affected by those changes - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes that the Commission also shall have regard to the conservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, unable to report to the Parliament on the processes of environmental impact studies, sees the Commission as better exercising this function of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include improving the efficiency with which the community’s productive resources are used - this involves the making of an economic judgment concerning the prospects of success for an industry and surely that should be within the compass of government and not within the compass of an outside commission as should be matters relating to the maintenance of an appropriate standard of living and full employment - facilitating adjustment to changes in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> and recognising the interests of consumers and consuming interests likely to be affected by measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost any pretext can be used for making a judgment on how industry resources will be used, how determinations will be made in the interests of consumers, how the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may be affected or the public interest concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission will be taking into account not how an industry might succeed but what the impact may be on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the employment situation or something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The small percentage of national revenue allocated to the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation by this the first Labor Budget in 24 years indicates that these two important facets of modern living are treated just as nice sounding rhetoric and not as matters of fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was rather amusing to hear the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  talk of the niggardly appropriation for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation because,  Mr Deputy Chairman,  you are no doubt aware that in 1972-73 the appropriation for the Department was $778,700, the actual expenditure was $760,215 and yet the appropriation for this year is $1,729,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member for Darling Downs should read the Appropriation Bill and perhaps reflect on the years of neglect of this field when there was simply the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation; it had not been brought up to the rank of a full department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member would be generous enough to admit that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is going through a building-up period and is steadily defining the functions it will serve as far as Australia is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I wish to refer to several matters which I think come within the scope of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Morrison), the Australian Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren),  the Australian Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  and the New South Wales Minister for Environmental Control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the brochure the study is designed to examine the impacts of about two long lifetimes of human settlement on a wide range of typical Australian coastal environments and from this to predict the course which future impacts may take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is going to be rather important in the future that we should be clear on the functions of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation because I note that the initial funding of this project was done through the Department of Science or through the Australian Minister for Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will sum up the present position of the Botany Bay project when he is making his closing remarks because it would seem that the results that will be obtained from that will have a great deal of application to many other areas in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too often, of course, the questions of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation are overshadowed by the question of wildlife conservation, or the term might even be ‘preservation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is giving any attention to this aspect, because if we are to think of this third alternative it is quite obvious that we must have a look at what regulatory devices we put into the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only in this way will the most important source of urban environmental pollution in any case be satisfactorily tackled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has indicated in another paper his interest in this matter of water supply, water resources research and water resources determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the problems that is predominant in Australia because of the relatively dry <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the arid nature of a lot of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many other environmental matters on which I would like to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has got off to a very good start in this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will certainly not endeavour to attack the Government on the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I, like previous speakers, have no desire to attack the Government on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that more money, thought and action must be devoted to the conservation of our forests and our water resources and to protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is most important from every point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> and, in particular, the countryside hold resources capable of many uses for agriculture and forestry, for water catchment purposes, for mineral workings, for settlement and, increasingly, for outdoor recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the rural <span class="highlight">environment</span> is valued in a less tangible way for the culture and history of its community, for its wildlife, for the beauty of landscapes and, in some areas, for its remoteness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental conservation is therefore concerned both with the quantity and quality of many different resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem can be eradicated by putting some more muscle into pollution control and by giving the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation more finance to enable him to work in co-operation with the States so that this dreadful raw sewage is stopped from entering our coast and desecrating the lovely beaches about which I have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for McKellar  (Mr Wentworth)  said that pollution and environmental control has mainly been in the hands of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is true but I feel that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will agree that we should be using our best endeavours to co-operate with the States to do whatever we can to improve our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to eliminate pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight while debating the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I wish to say something about the effect of cities and urban development on the quality of the air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most spectacular among the effects of the city upon the atmosopheric <span class="highlight">environment</span> are those caused by air pollution . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because we have an international responsibility for the protection of the global atmosphere, the Australian Government has in its platform on <span class="highlight">environment</span> a clause stating that it is the responsibility of the Australian Government to show leadership in co-ordinating measures designed to monitor the level of air pollution and to develop programs to protect the quality of air in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I urge the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to act as the Government’s conscience and as the nation’s conscience to make sure that we do not develop urban areas out of political whims - building castles in the sky - and seek to place them at locations which seem attractive for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When analysed in the calmer atmosphere that should prevail in a department such as that headed by the Minister, we should, if we find there are risks of an environmental nature which cause us to question politically made decisions, be strong enough to be outspoken and to have those decisions changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate many of the speakers have drawn attention to the significant - though I still suggest small - increase in the Australian Government’s financial allocation in respect of its concern and responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the resources whereby governments - State, Australian or local - can be funded to enable them to buy other areas of environmental significance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like other honourable members and concerned people, am worried that very often in debates such as this we talk a lot about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and create the illusion that a great deal is being done when in fact little is being done and that which is being achieved is often being achieved in a crisis atmosphere; where large sums of money are needed to save something in respect of which the public conscience cries out that it should be saved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we find that the resources of the nation are spent in saving something which, if the public had been alerted previously, could have been saved at a fraction of the cost and the balance of the money used for saving that environmental resource could have been spent in preserving other significant assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gained an inspiration to say something on this very important question affecting the nation and particularly to advert to the Labor Party’s determination to challenge the erosion of the country as the result of polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public alarm throughout the nation to my mind in the last decade has reached an all-time high on the question of pollution and the interest in the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in my view it needs to go a lot higher to truly awaken the Australian community as a whole as to the need to stir governments, both State and Federal, and the need to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> for future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a pity that we never had a government, State or Federal, with the interest in conservation and preservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> that my Government has shown in this very important subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we have not protected the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fatness of people’s purses became more important to them than the preservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and the Whitlam Administration are taking the most positive determined steps by the creation of the very ministry which the distinguished Minister holds to arouse even more the Australian people’s need to support the Government and the Department which is determined to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate of Hunter, of course, our greatest problem with the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> is coal dust from inferior coal that burns in chitter dumps for years and years once a fire is started by spontaneous combustion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not economical for the mining companies to curb or prevent this nuisance, 1 believe that our Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will sympathically consider subsidising steps to alleviate the worst of these nuisances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very proud of my Government, the Whitlam administration, for setting up a Ministry aimed at preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This awakened the minds of people and they went on to think about the destruction of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I again congratulate my Government for the positive steps it has taken in regard to this important social question and I wholeheartedly and sincerely congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the task that he is undertaking on our behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight the Committee is debating the estimates of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  could not do so out of the amount that his Department has been allocated this year but obviously this point will arise again later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation ultimately will become a most important and integral part of our future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way too I can see a future for this Australian Government in its role of protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation in that the Department will provide the expertise and the funds to help the smaller shires and also councils in the suburbs of the cities to provide this necessary means of disposing of their waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this Government our trade has been based on the fact that efficiency in trade depends on a competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world’s rich will have to do a little more about the world’s poor and new sets of international laws on <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation issues will be needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it is no coincidence that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control,  Mr Beale,  was sacked from that office because of his ineptitude in looking after conservation matters as they affect the welfare of the New South Wales people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  cannot move until he has his regions all worked out; the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  is tying up any decisions he may make with the Minister for Urban and Regional Development; and so it goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One area which has been proclaimed as suitable for a national park is the Mount Worth area in the Strzelecki Ranges which has everything to commend it economically, environmentally and conservationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is within pleasant driving distance from the metropolis and for that reason it should demand the support of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  whose constituents would be among the tourists who would benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very interesting range of subjects will be financed by this money: Firstly, as to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the wheat is grown - namely, the soil itself - moisture, organic matter, nitrogen content, microbiology and nutrients within the soil which are required for the adequate production of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee is concerned at the length of time the matter has been discussed, the cost and the number of reports which have been produced on various aspects of Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park development, and is concerned that immediate action should be taken to initiate measures to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and improve the appearance of the Park while making adequate provision for tourism and for meaningful Aboriginal involvement at every level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The rapid rise of tourists to the Park, the fragile nature of the arid <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the present management practices adopted have all led to great pressures on the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We applaud this modern day approach to this problem of treating these people initially in their homes where no embarrassment is felt and where, through the participation of the whole of the family in the healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is created, the patient can probably readjust himself and overcome his problem, whether it be an inability to cope, a problem with drink or a problem with drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a great tendency overseas in the training of nurses, for example, to shift from the traditional tertiary training of nurses - if we consider it tertiary training, and I do - in hospitals to the double stream where some of the nurses are trained totally in the hospital <span class="highlight">environment</span> and others are trained in a degree course in the particular nursing subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that although the education system provides a good general education to fourth form, it then becomes very restrictive in its discipline for students who wish to remain in the educational <span class="highlight">environment</span> but who are not necessarily interested in seeking a university degree, or even sixth form standard for that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the current Act which this Bill will replace is hopelessly inadequate and utterly incapable of providing a competitive business <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this country for many years hence, if indeed it would ever achieve that objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The fact is that the present Act is woefully inadequate to achieve its supposed objective of providing a more competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that inadequacy is directly attributable to the previous Government’s unwillingness to upset its big business friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is happening in Australia today is that these trendies like the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and the 2 Ministers at the table - the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Services and Property - have turned Australia into a place governed by white collar socialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, too, has been looking at the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some views that this level is caused by industry in the area, by the sewage output into the Derwent River, possibly by the run-off from galvanised iron roofs of which there are many in the Hobart area and also a possible combination of these factors with the naturally high levels of metal in the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is even the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  although I do not know what he has done in the course of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Housing in particular, _the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  on an earlier occasion, sought to bolster the fortunes of this union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren),  the Minister for Housing and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  have acted with propriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is nearly as practicable to the honourable gentleman may in the eyes of his friend the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  be thoroughly impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, and with authorities concerned with main roads, as well as with new departments established to look after ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers agreed that they were opposed to the uncontrolled harvesting of kangaroos and related species; that for conservation purposes selective culling or harvesting of certain species of kangaroos may be a legitimate management practice; and that a scientifically acceptable range of data gathering and control measures be drawn up to regulate culling or harvesting throughout Australia in the interests of conservation of the species and the general <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, New South Wales had not agreed that the annual quotas for each species of kangaroos harvested should be determined by consultation between the appropriate authorities of the States or Territories and the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has advised me that his State intends to implement a tagging system as part of its kangaroo management program in 1974, and is prepared to co-operate with the Australian Government in accordance with the working party’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  for making the report available to me towards the end of last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The time to enlarge our national park and sanctuary system is now, before some species of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are irretrievably alienated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the recommendations of the working party and the views expressed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will prevent the depletion of the fuel and energy resources needed to match Australia’s requirements and, of course, will guard the ecology and <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we looked at these animals in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> we might be able to clear up some of the fundamental problems of behaviour and ecology, and some of the fundamental problems of how much is inherited and how much is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of the interaction between science and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> also are now concerning the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally they will criticise, but in a virile, healthy political <span class="highlight">environment</span> any government can afford such criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is done I believe that this will be a most important development for the greater matching of what we can produce efficiently and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 25 January, the three heads of government agreed that Albury-Wodonga would be developed into a major city which will attract large numbers of Australians, which will attract industry, which will control pollution and protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and in which every attempt will be made to preserve the identity and character of the existing cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Development Corporation, conferred on it by the Federal and State governments, will include urban and regional planning and development, construction in designated areas, growth centre promotion, negotiation with Federal, State and local government agencies, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the involvement of the local community in the planning process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special attention will also be given to protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, not only of the centre itself, but also of areas which will be affected by the establishment of this new growth complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the preamble makes clear, this Agreement springs from the intentions of the 3 governments that a Development Corporation will bring about in Albury-Wodonga a city with a high quality of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, appropriately planned and developed, with full regard to human requirements and the involvement of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report on tourism examines the place of tourism in Australia in relation to individual demands, community values and our national identity and, most importantly, its relationship to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The pattern of demand for these resources will change with increasing affluence and general awareness of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the report of the Ayers RockMount Olga National Park tabled by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation of this House carries many lessons for the management of these areas close to Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for making it a condition for grants that the environmental impact of the project must be considered in formulating proposals for assistance and, if the impact is likely to be significant, demanding that an environmental impact statement be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Efficient government decision-making in a changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> requires more than just the redrawing of the boundaries as catchment areas shift or merge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, these objectives do not bring about equality but rather debase the quality of life and bring down people and their <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the lowest common denominator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the time is right for us now to embark upon a program of teaching neighbourhood law in our universities so that young lawyers can be aware of the laws dealing with and relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, laws relating to the administration of local government, approval of developments and the means of achieving a review of decisions when taken without thought to local opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already at the University of Sydney the students themselves are calling for the introduction in their courses of the teaching of environmental laws, or as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a course in environmental resources law established at the Australian National University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this type of teaching has to be more broadly based right through our universities so that people can get support from the legal profession to assist them in meeting the demands of protecting their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and protecting the type of locality in which they live and to ensure that the good things about our life are aided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a law of persistent change in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and persistent social change as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from Government statements that its new concern with continental defence and its confidence in a low threat <span class="highlight">environment</span> is based substantially on the latest strategic estimates which came this year from Defence Department planners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is understood that <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation have been taken into account throughout the studies of the State Planning Advisory Committee in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition it is understood that before a final decision is made as to which particular airport site is preferred the State Planning Advisory Council will require an Environmental Impact Statement on each of the alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(3 and 4) In the event of consideration being given the actual establishment of a second airline airport to serve Melbourne, as an Australian Government project, then public hearings primarily dealing with the environmental impact would be arranged in accordance with the recently announced policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and I preface it by referring to a proposal by Queensland Cement and Lime Co Pty Limited to establish a coral crushing plant at MacArthur Avenue, Meeandah at the mouth of the Brisbane River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that an environmental impact study has been carried out, though it appears that the company has not released the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only sense of realism in this matter has been injected by the Secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union who pointed out that unionists are likely to withdraw their labour because they take the view that an industry which is potentially dangerous to the health of people, or could have a deleterious effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should not be established until an environmental impact statement has been prepared and published so that the community can see it and comment on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the potentially hazardous nature of the proposed plant, the environmental impact study ought to be freely published and the community should be able to comment upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Moss  Cass, recently announced that the Australian Government had decided to sign the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the relationship between the teacher and the child will have a much greater influence on educattion than the surrounding facilities which, as I mentioned, are being given great attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the likelihood of far reaching changes in education and teaching methods as part of this rapidly changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which national policies must be continually determined and revised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems of migrant education which has been highlighted by some people recently is that the children of migrants, and of recently arrived migrants are involved in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> at school which is in so many respects foreign to that which they have left behind in the old country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has a small unit set up for deaf children and provides them with highly specialised training in the broader context of an ordinary, normal, day to day school <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is safe to assume that what the Government is saying to us at this stage is that the trend, in its opinion, is such that those people who are disadvantaged on environmental grounds should receive some inequality of treatment in order to bring them up to another standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every social group where we perceive and look at those matters it will be seen that people rise beyond their <span class="highlight">environment</span>, or from the richest sociological group they sink below it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I would like to say is that the grants made to many of the organisations which he quoted were, from my own personal knowledge, approved by  Mr Peter  Howson, the former Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need to design special types of houses - I know that the word ‘transitional’ is a dirty word in relation to housing, but it need not be - to cater for the particular needs of Aborigines and to suit the degree of transition that they have made from their own traditional <span class="highlight">environment</span> to living in the broader Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The name of the company includes the word ‘ecology’, but I am afraid that not a great deal of consideration was given to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> when the whole operation began. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I can learn, it appears that environmental consequences were not taken into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence, there has been a great imbalance and a complete maladjustment of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aborigine is in his <span class="highlight">environment</span> in, for example, raising cattle to supply the meat needs not only of a particular mining enterprise, such as that at Gove, but also that of the towns and the developing areas in that particular part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay full tribute to a second group - I do not like to hear people talk about the city slicker type of Aborigines - who live in the cities, who have come out of their natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and who have obtained university degrees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that we should take into the country as many people as we can find who suitably fit into our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, into our way of life, and who can contribute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In trying to direct development our concern must be first with the type of society and <span class="highlight">environment</span> we are trying to produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As we have overcome other difficulties so the attention of the Australian people has been directed to the importance of the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the community has become aware so have all those involved in the political process in this country become deeply conscious of the concern of the average Australian for the improvement of the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has meant that we have directed our attention to both the improvement of the existing urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the more rapid establishment of new urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this emerging consciousness by the Australian people as to the importance of urban development we have seen increasing attention paid to the policies of governments - national, State and local - in ensuring that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is developed in an orderly fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is important that this community desire to participate should receive the response of government so that people can play a real part in the decision making process on the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission reiterates what many of us have been saying for so long; that is, that most of the problems of our urban and rural <span class="highlight">environment</span> are brought about by the inadequacies of our present systems of land control and land management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I believe that a Constitution such as ours must always be regarded as a document that is dynamic, alive and capable of being changed to meet the changing <span class="highlight">environment</span>, changing economic and social circumstances, a changing culture, changes in our international status and relations and the growth of a greater national spirit, I do not believe that changes should be made to it unless such changes have received mature consideration by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite my friend sitting at the table opposite, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  to correct me if I am wrong, but he was quoted on 23 July 1972  -  I think this is a remarkably significant statement - as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past preventive medicine has been looked on as dealing with infectious disease or matters of public health, but we are becoming more and more aware of the stresses and strains of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, of the psychiatric factors that occur in the community, of the problems of inactivity of the housewife or other members of the community and perhaps the need for their retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> of our water playgrounds will improve, and our lakes, beaches and streams will be less polluted because the sullage traps and septic systems no longer will overflow and feed into the waterways or the gutters at the front of houses at the foot of the hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Auditor-General has not been asked to carry out a full inquiry into the specific recommendations by the House of Representatives Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation as the recommendations - set out on page 1 of the Committee’s Report on Turtle Farming in the Torres Strait Islands - are outside the ambit of the duties of the Auditor-General as laid down by the Audit Act 1901-1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has there been a complete environmental impact study on the effects of the suggested airstrip? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of erecting dams, and the Australian Government’s share in the cost of dams, for flood mitigation is a matter of continuing concern in which my colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is engaged in discussions with all the States, but particularly of course with the States of Queesland and New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that although the educational system provides a good general education to the fourth form, it then becomes very restrictive in its disciplines to students who wish to remain in the educational <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but who are not necessarily interested in seeking the sixth form standard or a university degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For so long a great deal of effort has been put into enticing manufacturers to make a complete commitment in the export arena, but this Government is progressively eroding the manufacturing export incentive scheme which has induced manufacturers to move into exports and which has taken them into the cold, competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> of international trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another example is the grants by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to local community groups to allow these groups to become their own environmental advocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleagues the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation have placed in the library for honourable members the report on regional development which T.

    <p>The Minister for the ‘<span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has said that La’bor policy in his field has been a series of failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following a question asked of my colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on 5 March I wish to make available for the information of honourable members the Environmental Assessment - Proposed Aerodrome on Lord Howe Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an increasingly <span class="highlight">environment</span> conscious society, it is now apparent that science and technology have themselves created problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a curious business because on 27 February a letter was written by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  on behalf of the Minister for Social Security to a colleague of mine on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope the question will not even be: Does this plan meet the needs of the GPO block without unreasonable violence to the adjacent city <span class="highlight">environment</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I urge the Committee to start at the other end and to ask: What is the ideal city <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that the redevelopment will materially enhance the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Forrest Place and will complement conceptual plans of the State Government and the Perth City Council for die development of the ‘heart of Perth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Through our related policies on roads, on making up the sewerage backlog, on urban public transport investment, on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, on education, on social welfare programmes and on health we are also seeking to bring an end to the isolated and incomplete development of new urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously in the present world <span class="highlight">environment</span> there is a major disability in excess dependence on either the United States dollar or the pound sterling as units of currency for international trade contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become apparent, I think, that students in Australia have been trained in a far more sophisticated <span class="highlight">environment</span> than exists in their home countries and much of the training which they receive in Australia, while being very valuable to themselves personally, is not always able to be put to good use in their home countries when they return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of bringing students to Australia we should be sending professors and teachers to their countries to train them in their local <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that they can then go out into the field without any dislocation caused by oversophistication in training’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Though it is important that there be a pool of educated people in the developing countries who understand the operations of a developed country, it is more important that the developing countries have technicians, educated academics and professional men understanding the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live and the development of which we wish to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to raise other aspects tonight, namely, the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the increased number of tourists, both those circulating in Australia, and, if we are successful, those coming from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will bring out shortly the interrelationship between the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the supporting industry, namely, tourism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This accelerating groundswell of opinion which signals the folly of environmental despoliation, combined with the change that has led to leisure and recreation no longer being the preserve of the few, has led to the recognition that the factor of socio-economic interdependence must be central to the development of a balanced and sensitive national tourism plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arising out of these discussions, proposals have been put forward for an agreement between governments which would protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Torres Strait Islands and the way of life of the Islanders and the coastal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would act to improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the quality of our life by actions, not by mere words upon which this Government relies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will tell the people that we cannot, as a nation, continue our maltreatment of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>; that in damaging the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we are damaging our capacity to keep a kind of living that we believe the Australian people deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who has done more than any man I know to subvert one decent environmental organisation in Australia thinks that this is amusing, but he will not be in this Parliament after the business either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are many in this Parliament - the honourable member for Lalor, the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation - who would be delighted if they could provoke the United States into that kind of activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is nodding his head in agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the nature of this core force, our geographical position as an island continent, with- a vast oceanic and archipelagic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, suggests some fundamental defence requirements and skills to be developed and preserved in all 3 Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I do not share the attitude, apparent in some public comment on our defence posture, that change in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> means that we shall necessarily be less secure, and that we must now act on the assumption that, when uncertainties resolve, things will be worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given Australia’s ocean-archipelago <span class="highlight">environment</span>, long range maritime patrol aircraft are a necessary part of Australia’s force structure at all times for both military and civil purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to put into effect our view that we must have a self-reliant maritime capacity - a capacity to operate independently over the vast distances that comprise our maritime <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I illustrated in a debate in the chamber the other day, through reference to a series of articles contributed by Professor Hogan of Sydney University, the degree to which the inflationary impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> is isolated from that overseas because of the measures which have been taken with respect to the appreciation of the currency and the degree to which there are major shortages of commodities in the northern hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those two factors mean that there is no longer within Australia a paramount influence causing the inflation in our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second guideline chosen by the Committee was that the broader the approach in technical and further education the more the likelihood of creating an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which self motivated individuals can reach their vocational goals and in which motivation may be regenerated in people who have lost it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They involve departments and institutions other than my own - Education, Labour, Social Security, <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, Urban and Regional Development, the Council for the Arts and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government will promote these opportunities by continuing commitments to develop Land Commissions and new growth centres, the national sewerage program, area improvement programs, <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact studies, and through the constant monitoring of resource allocation within our great urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation will be introduced to implement the Government’s policy of ensuring that needs of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the views of the public are fully considered in governmental decisions particularly in relation to projects under the control of, or funded by, the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, his colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  was quoted on 23 July 1972 as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>What better <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to launch this deceptively simple, superficially appealing and apparently cheaper scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s time we stopped destroying our nation’s reputation as a stable, hospitable <span class="highlight">environment</span> for investment and development that are good for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The project has been developed with careful consideration for the protection and enhancement of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures designed to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> will include a soil conservation program to reduce erosion in the catchment area and sediment deposit in Lake Burley Griffin; the preservation of permanent geological features including the London Bridge; a natural limestone bridge over Burra Creek which is a geological feature with tourist potential; and the undergrounding of pipelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These professional skills should blend with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Glebe both in its landscape and its community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I believe that the lessons that will be learnt from the Glebe project, the detailed understanding of the problems of low income earners living in the inner city, and the solutions which emerge towards providing an effective way for the community to participate in shaping their <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be of immense benefit to Governments, professional people and to all those concerned with improving the quality of life in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham),  who is the honourable member for Capricornia, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who is the honourable member for Maribyrnong, the honourable member for Kingston  (Dr Gun)  and the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AIDC must take into account monetary policy and &lt;policies in relation to trade practices, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, industrial relations, the efficiency of industry and perhaps regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of an environmental impact statement with this legislation has exposed the Government as a humbug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  allowed this Bill to be presented without the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has frequently claimed to be concerned with our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here is this great champion of the conservation cause presenting legislation with admittedly widespread environmental consequences knowing that in fact an environmental impact statement is in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  raise the point that it is regrettable that the environmental impact study has not been tabled and has not been made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it must become a feature of government to table such studies with every project of this nature, whether or not it is being carried out by the NCDC Let us face it; the National Capital Development Commission should not have any prior right to be exempt from the scrutiny of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the future any proposal for a project of this type will be accompanied by an environmental impact study for the benefit of those who are concerned about environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, a very big environmental factor is attached to the construction of the Googong Dam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Captains Flat pollution problem will then intensify the environmental problems of the Canberra lake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the House, but I am sure that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  will quietly agree with me that with every works project of this type there should be tabled an environmental impact study, whether it recommends that the project go on or whether it recommends that it should not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the public generally expects this of governments today because of the increasing despoliation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> by greater numbers of people, by industrialisation and all forms of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might even accompany the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to see whether we can protect that delightful area of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The planning and design of the Googong project has been carried out with great care to ensure that the construction of the project will have a minimum impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second report entitled ‘Road Safety: Roads and their <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’ was presented on the last day of the previous Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>environmental aspects of legislative and administrative measures which ought to be taken in order to ensure the wise and effective management of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and of Australia’s natural resources, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>such other matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation and the management of Australia’s natural resources as are referred to it by- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the committee or any sub-committee have power to consider and make use of the evidence and records of the House of ‘Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation appointed during the Twenty-eighth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in its operations will conclude the references which had already been placed before it before the double dissolution occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal and Country Parties recognise there is increasing community awareness of the need to improve the living <span class="highlight">environment</span> of major urban centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally there is growing community concern to protect land or buildings which contribute to ,he quality of the living <span class="highlight">environment</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that the people of Glebe are entitled not only to the kind of shelter that they have had throughout their lives but also to an uplifted <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In meeting these needs we are concerned not only with housing but also with the wider concerns of the total human <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  who said that the Federal Government had taken a punt on the choice of the site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Societies are not static structures but ever-changing inter-relationships between people and between people and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me offer a few interesting facts on timber and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of their remoteness from this area honourable members may be unaware of the impact of a timber milling industry in an otherwise natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare therefore the damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by the use of timber as a building material with the use of, -say steel or aluminium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disturbance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by any quarrying activity is self-evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent American investigation into disturbance of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> came up with these figures: concrete products, 24 to 48 per cent; steel, 9 per cent; aluminium, 28 per cent; timber, 2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody said to be concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be 100 per cent behind the timber industry in its campaign to become self-sufficient in raw material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That he should exercise thought and responsibility towards the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the process goes without saying, but in the final analysis man must eat and be sheltered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has already demonstrated the economic and social benefits of decentralisation - not the concept of decentralisation that was practised by the previous Government of transplanting individual industries from a city to the country but rather the establishment of the whole infrastructure of the urban industrial society in a rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, it plans to marry the desirable characteristics of urban society in the form of well planned living, working, recreational and cultural facilities to the advantages of the Australian rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to the ultimate benefit of both elements of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a wise measure of community involvement and delegated authority, we could encourage the development of indigenous art forms and other avenues of creative cultural expression which reflect the particular nature of the inland cities - cities built on a human scale and in harmony with the surrounding rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely by some rezoning of the property or even by the Commonwealth buying the properties and farming them out to people who want to buy them and renovate them within a set plan, we would be able to achieve a far better <span class="highlight">environment</span> in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who has lived his lifetime in mining areas and in a mining <span class="highlight">environment</span> I derived great joy from the fact that we were at long last to have an independent commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is necessary, therefore, to adapt to the new economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no denying that these non-bank financial institutions operating in a competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> can increase the efficiency of the financial sector in attracting funds and channelling them into the areas they are needed most <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In today’s conditions such a policy of permanent direct control would be another clear admission by the Government and the Treasurer of their inability satisfactorily to manage the economy or understand the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which non-banking financial intermediaries work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  are still battling for control of the population planning section of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting aspect of this struggle is that both the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development are avowed supporters of zero population growth, whilst the Minister for Labor and Immigration is responsible for manpower planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Migrants felt that in this new and often strange <span class="highlight">environment</span> they had a ready symbol of the Government’s concern for their particular problems - one they could turn to for assistance and one they knew. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the .past decade, the Australian dairyfarming industry has adjusted rapidly to changing economic circumstances: farms have expanded in area; productivity per farm and per cow has increased markedly; smaller herds have been withdrawn from dairying or grown larger; and the industry has become more concentrated in areas with  a  better <span class="highlight">environment</span> for dairy production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should also take this opportunity to thank the officers and staff who have done so much to help me settle into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of this House in particular to the Government’s failure to appreciate in depth the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we must live and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the political <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia severe unemployment is simply not an acceptable political response to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is a real and pressing case for decentralisation of authority and that local governments will best perform many governmental functions in such critical areas as welfare, culture and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have provided a little longer time in office for this poor Prime Minister who, in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the country, is putting forward such peevish propositions as this and who is for all the world like the chicken that has come out of the coop, pecked and worried and bleeding from the hawks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July 1972 the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be required to interfere as little as possible with navigation, to have regard to the conservation of the reserves of the sea and the sea bed, to have regard to operations being carried on by other persons engaged in similar activities and to consider, in the exercise of its functions, factors connected with the ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The use of this term first arose in 1969 when, following the most profitable decade in the history of the oil industry, that industry faced problems in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, import quotas and the oil depletion allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all sincerity and honesty, on behalf of this side of the chamber I moved that 2 persons who had specialised and expert knowledge of preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation be added to the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission for the very purpose that I have stated to the House tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have got a bosom friend of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development from the far Left of the Australian political spectrum,  Mr Jack  Mundey, appointed to one of 2 positions that Parliament said- not only the Minister said it- should conform to the description of a person who was expert in the field of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have got, I think, the present Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation as representing, might I say, onethird of the Parliament’s decision to appoint to this important Advisory Committee 2 people who were competent in the fields of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that he will come into this House in due course and explain why he flouted the authority of the Parliament by appointing one of his bosom pals- Jack Mundey to two positions that this Parliament said should go to people who were expert in the fields of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to know also by what method of ministerial machinations or mental processes the Minister arrived at the incredible solution that when Parliament empowered him to appoint two additional members to the Advisory Council of the Cities Commission, who were to be two trained and competent people in the fields of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation, it empowered him to appoint this man to that job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- I join with my colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in tabling the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A pleasing feature of the report is its rejection of the widely held notion that conservation and preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are a ‘middle class ‘ issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To protect and conserve the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> requires conservation to be part of the normal planning and development process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have felt for some time that too often in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection field we have been treating the causes of abuse rather than trying to establish an inventory so that proper land use decisions can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>William Morris had one great advantage in his writing days; he was writing in a cosy provincial <span class="highlight">environment</span> which had been man-made for more than 400 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The William Morris the Minister talked about was a very wealthy socialist and he lived in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where 400 years of manmade effort enabled him to assume the sort of statements and writings that he was able to produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is against that background that we can afford now to protect and conserve our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only because of that situation that we can now turn our attention to preserving and conserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the national estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are one of the last developed nations to have a large part of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> left virtually in its natural state and it is up to all men and women, not just the socialists, to preserve as much of it as is economically and socially possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This industry produces its product in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where costs are boosted by the tariff wall and by industrial policies of the Government, and are abetted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather a chaotic <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a very sad reflection on the Labor Government’s monetary policy when increases in inputs other than the main substance, wheat, have been more than twice as important in determining the price of bread, and increased paper costs were just as important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an outrage on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have to forego revenue that is a proper price- it is a very small price in terms of dollars- to pay for the improvement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for the improvement of living conditions in our cities and centres of population where the car exhaust is the main contributor towards atmospheric pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are serious about improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we should be thinking in terms of encouraging in every way the conversion to LPG of petrol driven vehicles, particularly in the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have given more revenue but we really believed in preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is spending large amounts of money on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the dollar lost in forgoing a little revenue on LPG which a taxi might use would be very much more productive in terms of improving on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> than the average dollar that the Government is spending under this heading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, from the point of view of the environmentalist this is what we want to encourage in the centre of the cities where the motor car exhaust emissions are one of the main sources of atmospheric pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it not a small price to pay for improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for reducing atmospheric pollution in the cities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government quite rightly- I praise the Government for it- is saying that it is spending money on reducing pollution and improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the amount of revenue it would forgo by letting a vehicle refrain from paying the amount it otherwise would have to pay in excise above the $30 I have suggested would be more than made up by the saving in the amount it is spending on measures to improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the Government drop some of its pretence about being so environmentally minded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When something practical can be done about a matter which affects the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, aU the Government does is wring its hands and say: ‘Look, we might be losing a few dollars to the Treasury’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government just to do its sums, do a little bit of arithmetic and it will see that the loss to the Treasury about which it is talking will be quite miniscule compared with the money it is spending, and in many cases spending very rightly, on improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is something on which the good faith of the Government on the environmentalist issue is in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The good faith of the Government on the issue of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is now in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or is its pride and its vanity, in trying to push everything and by steamrolling this measure through this House, greater than its concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second aspect is the pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we must look to the preservation and improvement of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks to the possibilities for the future in respect of what can be achieved in the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> by a national government under a responsible Minister, such as we now have, and one bears in mind the assistance given to local government through the Grants Commission and through the many other subsidy schemes now operating, and one sees other programs take shape and come to fruition eliminating problems associated with urban life- programs related to transport, health and social amenities- one realises the delays which have adversely affected progress in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard some comments from the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Bennett)  and the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews),  both of whom have said that members of the Opposition are not really concerned about matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, meeting the problems of urban communities and solving the problems related to sewering metropolitan areas, regional areas and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that the following five approaches might be made to the problem of setting standards: These approaches could be based, firstly, on health aspects, which would involve doctors and scientists; secondly, mental health aspects, which would involve psychologists and social scientists; thirdly, the number of complaints from the community; fourthly, cost benefits, which would involve economists; and, fifthly, absolutism, which would involve some environmentalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that it is very essential that the present proposal should be extended to include smaller country towns, particularly when we realise that as a means of decentralisation elderly people are being encouraged to retire to these smaller country towns where they are close to their friends, close to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> into which they have been born and in which they have grown up and to which as members of the community they have contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I bring this to the attention of the Minister because I want him in the not too distant future to inspect the Nine Mile Beach outlet and the BlacksmithsPelican area in general to see the damage being caused to the area and the harm being caused to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to see the conditions under which the residents live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In political terms Eric Harrison was very much in the mood of our political philosophy of today, namely, where the individual is entitled to be considered predominantly above the interests of the State, that the State exists to serve the interests of the individual and to create the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the individual to prosper and be able to fulfil himself as an individual on the basis that successful individuals will make a successful community, and that the community, from the success of individuals, will be able to do those things which it wants for the poor, the sick, people overseas and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the Minister is very keen about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may I say in passing that the construction of such a railway will involve also the removal of some houses and no doubt some rare species of plant and animal life will be affected, as at Lake Pedder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am trying to get across to the House is that it is important to realise that tourism is not an isolated thing but that it has to be looked at in the context of the way in which it integrates with urban and regional development, town planning, conservation, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amount will be payable to the parents or guardians of a mentally or physically handicapped child cared for in a family <span class="highlight">environment</span> and requiring constant attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the allowance which, as honourable members will be aware, is $10 a week to the parents of guardians of physically or mentally handicapped children who are cared for in the family <span class="highlight">environment</span>, will meet with wide approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask you,  Mr Speaker,  why there would need to be 4 RED Ministers- the Minister for Labor and Immigration, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation  (Mr Stewart),  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-This is the first report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in the Twentyninth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s major aim was to examine the effect of mining and other activities on the flora and fauna of Christmas Island and to advise on any measures necessary to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a responsibility to ensure that this bird, and other species of fauna, do not become extinct as a result of our exploitation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sets the seal on the socialist view of people as simply the products of their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next observation I make to my friend the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  who is in the House and for whom I have the utmost affection is this: Why the haste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do ask the Government to consider whether there ought not to be some type of option of capitalisation available to the victim of such an accident because one of the additional tragedies of a person who suffers such a permanent accident as that is that he is so often forced out of his own family <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the desire of parents and relatives to care for them in a home <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to give them some kind of emotional and personal support to alleviate much of the suffering they have, they are forced out of that family <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that far more emphasis should be placed on making provision to assist people to care for relatives who are victims of accidents in their family <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister now is the victim of his own <span class="highlight">environment</span> and I think it is pertinent to record in this debate some of the failings that the Minister has had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can hardly blame the Department of Northern Development for this, because when one looks at the responsibilities of the various Ministers one finds that the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  has all the say in meat and wool production, the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  has all the say in regard to the mining industry, the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  has all the say in regard to our road system in the north, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has most of the say in this area, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  no doubt has most of the say in any development projects which may be proposed for the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether this is the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation or of the Minister for Northern Development does not really concern me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health of the community should at all times be considered and a standard of <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can be excused for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is created when we hear comments such as those which have been uttered by speakers opposite and inspired by a prejudiced outlook and a lopsided argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand there are some expected to be reduced outlays such as those in relation to the Intergovernmental Commission on European Migration and the United Nations <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to put to the Government for considerationI do not say this in any critical sense- the proposition that an examination might be made of our social services to see whether it is possible to give some incentive to families to care to a much greater extent for the elderly members of their families in their own home environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no doubt that the caring of elderly people within their own family <span class="highlight">environment</span> is socially, and I think in the long run also economically, beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole philosophy behind the provision was to give a bit of assistance and incentive to those in the community who were prepared to undertake care of the elderly in their family, their close relatives, within their own home <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lump sum payments would often make it possible for those persons to be cared for in their own family <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that perhaps as an interim measure the Government might give some consideration to the extension of the domiciliary allowance and the removal of the limit of 65 years or over where a person has been the victim of an accident and is being cared for in his or her own family <span class="highlight">environment</span> by close relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in a number of Scandinavian countries some financial incentives through the taxation mechanism are given to persons who are caring for the elderly within their own family <span class="highlight">environment</span> and have had to make extensions to the home to care for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would hope that this Government and successive governments of this country will give in the provision of social services much greater emphasis to the creation of circumstances in which people will have incentives to care for the elderly within their own <span class="highlight">environment</span> and accordingly I hope that the emphasis of our social service provisions will be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in total agreement with him that the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> is undoubtedly the ideal one, but with so many families now in small homes and so many parents working it is not feasible for a large number of elderly people to live with their relatives, and therefore we desperately need homes for the aged where they can retain independence and nursing homes for those who are no longer able to care for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been my opinion also that handicapped children should be moved as often as possible back into the normal State school <span class="highlight">environment</span> instead of being segregated as they are at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having looked after elderly parents in the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> myself I am well aware of how necessary it is for those who want to care for their elderly people at home to have somewhere to take them so that the younger people can have a day or a weekend off or a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also good for those elderly people who are being cared for at home to move out into a different <span class="highlight">environment</span>, into a more stimulating <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to move among their peers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be a great saving to the Government if people were to be kept in the very desirable <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that most of these migrants, because of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are happy here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In addressing myself to the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I wish to draw attention to the way in which the administration and programming of expenditure on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is fragmented between the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and the Department of Urban and Regional Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1.I do not have the departmental estimates as such but I would assume the estimates for the 2 departments aggregate the total amount of expenditure on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be noted that on page 49 of the paper, under section 6, ‘Urban and Regional Development NEC and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’, the section headed ‘Protection of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’ deals with Department of Urban and Regional Development initiatives and we find that $250,000 is listed within that category for a national air monitoring program and $100,000 is listed for an education program to develop a public environmental awareness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just spoken to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and I have found that that does in fact reside within his own area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that the national estate could comfortably reside within the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not easy for the ordinary layman- indeed it is not easy for those of us in this House unless we spend a lot of time going through the Budget papers- to readily add together the total amount being spent in the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in nature conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) 1974-75 of $475,000 to such bodies as the River Murray Commission for water resources research, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the United Nations convention and forum for the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage, the Australian Environmental Council and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grants in aid to conservation organisations total $448,000 are also provided for in the appropriation for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, yet the Department of Urban and Regional Development appropriates $299,000 to other conservation groups and to the various trusts in each one of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely these grants and appropriations should be the responsibility of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and its Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This splitting serves to weaken the role of a very important department and the influence of its Minister at a time when people generally are conscious of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, conscious of the  need to try to protect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To provide focus in the machinery of government for conservation of the present state of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the social, technological and ecological factors relating to the proposed actions or evolutionary changes affecting it and for recommending environmentally beneficial courses of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the definition is in some ways vague, although it does not give the Department a full policy making function and limits it to focusing on the machinery that should be adopted, in my view the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation should have a full responsibility in the areas to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest- I do so in a personal way- that those functions should include the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the national estate, urban and rural land use strategies and policies, anti-pollution, wildlife and nature conservation, responsibility for the education of the community in conservation, water and soil resources and conservation policies, and the administration of those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the resource area, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, urban and regional development, housing and works, and <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation could well come together within the one unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation should have an important liaison role with all the resource use areas, possibly with one senior liaison officer in each component resource area which would make up the single unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In discussing the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I feel rather inhibited by my chairmanship on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for his thoughtful contribution to the debate on the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a developing realisation throughout the world that governments and parliaments must play an active part in the field of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really, this Parliament should be able to discuss the role that officers of the Department are playing in the United Nations environmental program, where Australia stands with regard to the Earthwatch program and what Australia is doing about the exposition on human habitat; yet, because of the very nature of the way in which things have been presented, this Committee does not have the opportunity to examine those programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament has had representatives at the 3 interparliamentary conferences on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> over the last 4 years; yet we have no mechanism by which the Parliament can follow through the sorts of matters that are raised there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation does so, but what it does is not brought forward so that honourable members can examine what has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become trendy amongst governments throughout the world to talk about environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  the honourable member for Gwydir and I heard a gentleman who is very skilled in the field express his concern about the use of the word ‘impact’ in the term ‘environmental impact statements’ because it has some connotation of force, confrontation, the adversary principle in examination and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The completion of an international agreement (with provision Tor the standardisation or testing procedures) requiring each nation (a) to test specified products and processes particularly those containing  non-degradable,  nonrecyclable or toxic components, for their potential effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and (b) to publish the results of these tests before the products are introduced on the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Republic of Germany is establishing within  UMPLIS  -  which is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> planning information system:  a special data bank on such information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This takes that so-called <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statement quite a deal further into the situation of examining products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere, through looking at the operations of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, can I see that thread that allows members of the Standing Committee to be able to discuss what is going on or to receive guidance as to what is going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We still have a situation where it is quite easy for a developed country to put its dirty, environmentally unsound and contaminated processes into developing countries because of the economic carrot on the stick that developed countries can offer to developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this subject in the hope that we may devise some procedures to get the overall picture on the matters that are dealt with by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and, in fact, in the hope that that Department will develop further and into a better, and better understood, role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was particularly pleased to hear the most helpful comments on overseas trends made by the honourable member for Scullin and his reference to the attitude overseas to environmental studies and statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally I was very pleased to hear the contribution of the honourable member for Gwydir in relation to the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and his reference to the way in which the Department perhaps should be organised in terms of the Government’s structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the submission by the Department of Urban and Regional Development to the National Estate Task Force Inquiry includes a contribution by  Dr D.  F. McMichael on the role of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  accepts that statement as being representative of the attitude that his Department ought to be taking now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the New South Wales Government was complimented when it discovered that the Commonwealth found it necessary to draw the Permanent Head of the new Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation from the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity therefore when shortly thereafter one sees statements by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, who is at the table, supporting people who are outside government and outside until recently even roles in respect of this Government in terms of its own commission although the gentleman to whom I will refer I understand, for a short time held certain offices under the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 9 November 1973, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, referring to the imposing of green bans by the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation, said that these were immensely effective and ought to be supported by every Australian who cared about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Various bodies, such as the Public Works Committee of this Parliament and statutory authorities in other States, investigate matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and I am concerned lest delays occur through the duplication of hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In talking to the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I think it is well to remember that this is a new department which was created just after the 1972 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Charles Court does not understand that there is a conflict between development and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation was drawing attention to the possible dangers of the Alwest complex- we all know that the Minister is a very mild mannered and rational type of expositor of this point of viewthe Premier of Western Australia said that this was absolute nonsense, that there had never been any dangers from bauxite mining in Western Australia and that in fact it was fruitless continuing a conversation with the Minister because he just did not understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another similar example to which the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation drew attention relates to the need to preserve the wet lands which in Western Australia are now under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there will continue to be similar irrationality until such time as people are prepared to face up to the dangers that accompany rampant development or development which is not proceeded by proper studies with proper consideration of what effect it will have on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With reference to the problems that are being experienced in the Goodradigbee Shire, the State Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Planning,  Sir John  Fuller, has recently been put into a position where he had little alternative but to raise the subdivision limit in that shire from 100 to 1,000 acres, and that is in the area immediately adjoining the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that in a planned society or in a planned urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> people, no matter how much money they have, what their job is or even what their aspirations are, have much better living conditions than they would have if their society or <span class="highlight">environment</span> were left unplanned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a report entitled ‘Roads and their <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’ which was tabled recently, that Committee pointed out that one of the ways in which we can reduce the number of road accidents in Australia is by proper urban planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reading through the Estimates I frequently came across wording such as lands, buildings, preserved, restore, enhance, conserve and <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Minister that traditionally and on the lead given to us by many countries with a great many more years experience in this field than we have had, the most effective way of dealing with the problem of matters coming under the National Estate- I do not in any way wish to decry the excellence of this program- is to place them under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> portfolio which has a team of specialists, people who are closely related to a study of the area, the preservation of buildings and the seeking out of historic sites and in fact historical towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The links between conservation, preservation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are, in my view, the ones that are very close and I would feel that despite the Minister’s interest in the matter they are best dealt with under the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be noticed that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been given licence to control its own destiny and to exercise its own powers but, as can be seen from the speech of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in introducing this Bill, clause 6 provides that the Board shall have power to determine rules and standards to be observed by licencees in relation to commercial broadcasting and television programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the view which the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who introduced the Bill, has invited us to take, and there is the view which the Bill demands that we should take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not all on the profit side and I think it behoves the Government in consideration of the industry as a whole to take cognisance of the fact that the industry is sustaining some of the costs to maintain our <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the state which we would all prefer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, with respect to the desirability of maintaining disadvantaged people in their own home <span class="highlight">environment</span>, that could be a matter of even greater concern with younger people than with aged people who are at present the only beneficiaries of this domiciliary nursing care benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The community will then obtain directly, from local production, those goods and services for which the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and resource endowment are best suited; it will exchange its surplus production of those goods and services for that of other countries producing more efficiently the other goods and services it needs; and it will concentrate industry development in the types of production most suited to local conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year Cabinet approved a document submitted by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  on water resources management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I quoted earlier, the basic philosophy expressed by this Government is that the conservation, development and management of water resources must take place in the broader framework not only of the development and management of resources generally but also of the overall economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> and social platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My interest in this dam occasioned my asking a question of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  some few weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that in advertisements in Melbourne newspapers the SEC claims that the proposal for the Newport powerhouse has the support of the Federal Ministry of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurerdesignate of this country has consistently adopted the propaganda line that inflation and unemployment in Australia are products of the international economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the socalled system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation the Australian Government will extend the impact statement requirement to cover any proposal in which it is involved and which is likely to have a significant effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, irrespective, of whether or not it is a matter to be decided by Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it will be used to ensure that the environmental effects of mining and woodchip proposals are thoroughly evaluated before any decision is taken on export licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These extensions merely use Australian Government constitutional powers which, because of the indifference of earlier government to environmental issues, were never applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council there has been basic agreement on what statements should cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government will have to rely to a large extent on State government advice in assessing the environmental consequences of proposals in which it is involved and which are being developed in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which it will rely on State <span class="highlight">environment</span> authorities will depend on the confidence it has in those authorities, on its judgment of their independence and on the significance of the proposals from the national viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, where the environmental consequences of a proposal are considered to be particularly significant, or where there is considerable public controversy over these consequences, a public inquiry will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assessment of the environmental consequences will be conveyed to Cabinet at the same time as the proposal itself is put to Cabinet for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we will ensure Cabinet considers the economic, technological and environmental consequences of proposals at the same time, before any decision is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure will not give to environmental considerations a veto power in decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental considerations will become an integral part of the information upon which a decision is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents a very significant step forward in contributing to the adequate protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and should be of real benefit to all Australians, irrespective of their occupation, their political outlook of their place of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a problem of which, I know, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  is aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Conservation is an exercise in applied ecology to fit man into his <span class="highlight">environment</span> so as to provide for his needs now and in the future in a manner which will maintain a satisfactory human habitat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the extension of powers to the Australian Parliament in such matters as the petroleum submerged lands legislation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which are so important nationally and internationally and which are interconnected in the world in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although since that hearing there has been a change by the Tribunal of its attitude towards price increase applications by the dairying industry, it is important to remember that no farm industry can survive in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of rising production costs exceeding 25 per cent per year while prices received for its products are increasing by only one per cent per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1972, the former Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts,  Mr Howson,  said in a second reading speech that the procedures that were to be adopted in a Bill he was putting forward were ironed out in consultation and after discussion with the State Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic assumption in the Bill is that either by dint of <span class="highlight">environment</span> or by geography a measure of political infallibility can come to Canberra but cannot go anywhere else in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The courses that the Opposition proposes should be instituted at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College are those connected with a city-country type of <span class="highlight">environment</span>- those connected with surveying and valuing of land, those connected with the environmental sciences whereby people look at the influence of man on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and at the way in which the landscape is affected by the development taking place with the construction of houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The environmental sciences could utilise a large part of the facilities already there, taking in such things as soil science and town and country planning, supplemented by things like environmental psychology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> is hostile, is obvious enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is self evident that if we are dealing with homeless people and wish to grapple seriously with the problems, the first basic requirement will be the provision of a ‘home-like’ <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I preface my comments on the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Bill and also the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Bill by thanking the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  for his frank and ready co-operation in an endeavour to reach consensus on a number of matters that have concerned the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister agrees with the view that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> does not belong to any one group or party or section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was an essentially practical politician, President Pompidou, who coined the phrase ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span> ethic’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to accept the Opposition ‘s criticism of the Bill and the amendments which the Opposition proposes as being prompted by the wish to see a wider acceptance of this <span class="highlight">environment</span> ethic, and to see this Bill becoming a potent force in securing that acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board resolved that it be suggested to the Minister Tor the Northern Territory that he recommit to Cabinet its decision concerning some of the functions allotted to the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, to enable it to take account of some aspects of this matter that may have been overlooked when its decision was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board considers that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation should act as a policy body and give assistance with finance, co-ordination etc., for all States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that the Commonwealth should set out in this Bill, indeed in all the other Bills relating to the care and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to seek the closest co-operation with all the governments and statutory authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the truth of the matter is that in the Northern Territory on 6 November 1973 senior officers of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation attended a meeting in Darwin of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first section at page 4 is headed ‘Ecologically oriented studies’ and the second section at page 5 is headed ‘Relationship to Funding by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) The Working <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division of the Australian Department of Labor and Immigration conduce an ongoing program of research into personnel practices and issues affecting the quality of working life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-32-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in Australia many of these areas of responsibility reside in departments other than the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and will be covered by authorities other than the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that some consideration will be given to that aspect and perhaps we may see the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  at some stage giving the same son of economic assessment of what the national park setup in Australia means to the Australian economic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action is needed to protect and develop properly our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and our natural resources, minimise the pollution of our air, land and water, conserve our flora and fauna, preserve our historic buildings and sites and preserve and create urban and rural landscapes of beauty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in his second reading speech appears to have avoided it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It requires careful consideration to ensure that the measure is appropriate to our federation and the proper protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am optimistic that in his speech in reply the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will assert the Government’s clear intention not to interfere but to co-operate with and to assist the States in their work in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pleasing that the Opposition supports this measure which seeks to acknowledge the responsibility of the Australian Government for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the public at large will join with all political parties in accepting this responsibility so that concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be regarded as a non-political, national issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill should be seen as a measure of the Government ‘s sincerity and determination to halt the destruction and the disturbance of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> which has taken billions of years to build up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the very short time in which the white man has settled in Australia the <span class="highlight">environment</span> has been threatened because of lack of government direction and shortsighted economic exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also should be seen as a measure of the Government’s desire and determination to ensure that its plans for the development of new urban growth centres in rural environments are supported by adequate national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If necessary, those national parks should become integral parts of the recreational <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the new cities and new growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further important feature of the Bill is the extent to which it will safeguard the special needs of Aboriginals whose natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> has been ruthlessly exploited and destroyed with drastic effects on their culture and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Institutions of learning such as the Canberra College of Advanced Education offer a number of courses relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, ecological studies and conservation and park management, as well as land use and resources location and urban planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policies of the Labor Government recognise the traditional Australian preference for the urban way of life and it seeks to combine that preference with the advantages of the rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to establish and combine the whole urban superstructure in the form of well-planned living, recreational and cultural amenities with a rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, just as we have done in the A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in his second reading speech said that despite the excellent leadership initiatives taken in some of the States our record in Australia has not been good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume the Minister means what he has said but on one occasion a former Minister, a colleague of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation who is at the table, made all sorts of noises about a 32 square miles acquisition area south of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing these things in mind, I hope that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will give very serious consideration to the amendment relating to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In introducing this Bill, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has brought in a most important piece of legislation concerning conservation in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly the 3 components of the cultural and natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> forming the National Estate are those which are: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In supporting them we thank the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  for taking into account the wishes of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aboriginal Affairs which brought this matter to the attention of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has assured me that that is not the intention unless the State itself requires the Australian Government to, or suggests that the Australian Government may, take over those areas if it feels that the Australian Government may have more resources or is more adequately able to cope with the preservation of such areas as historical, archaeological or geologically important areas, or areas that may have a special significance to Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister could quite rightly claim that he has introduced environmental protection legislation which gives the Minister power to call for environmental impact assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes other Commonwealth departments responsible for the submission of environmental impact assessments in areas where there is Australian Government involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have no doubt that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation who is sitting at the table would, in fact, as a matter of course demand that an environmental impact assessment be provided with regard to any operations that may be contemplated within a reserve or a national park another may not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the thinking of many well informed environmentalists around the world that it is probably better to allow mining to take place where there is mineralisation and where it may be considered to be in the national interest provided the mining is undertaken according to very strict guidelines and under the codes of the plans of management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before any consideration is given to the possibility of mining I think it should be mandatory that those who are going to take part in the mining exercise, whether it be done by the proposed Petroleum and Minerals Authority, by private enterprise or in association with an authority of the Australian Government, should undertake an environmental impact assessment to ascertain the likely effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> within that park and the area adjacent thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would require the approval of 27 Ministers rather than the approval of 2 Ministers- in the first instance the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and certainly, as prescribed in the clause, the Minister of State for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan of management of the park has to be approved not just by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation or his <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to raise with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I am a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I feel that I should thank the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  for being so co-operative in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was glad to hear the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  say that the programs for the protection, conservation, management and control of wildlife would be implemented and organised in co-operation with each State concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  with characteristic frankness and fairness will accept this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that when the Australian Labor Party got to power many of us on the Government side in 1972 and at the beginning of 1973 felt that we had gained office because- among other reasons- of our concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I assume that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  would be prepared to discuss that matter with the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy),  and on that basis the Opposition has not proposed any further amendments to clause 70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition supports the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will have farreaching effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the former Liberal-Country Party Government formed the first Ministry with <span class="highlight">environment</span> as one of its specific responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full credit must go to the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe,  Mr McMahon,  for the first initiative in recognising the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a dimension that should be taken into consideration when coming to a decision on any proposal of a structural nature or otherwise which might affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, the honourable Peter Howson, established the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council which is a council of State and Commonwealth Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it has a tremendous role to play in trying to bring about the sort of co-operation which is necessary to achieve a total involvement in the consideration of problems and matters which affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that statement it was announced that the Government had decided to introduce a system of environmental impact statements designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, from memory, that was the first time that 1 heard the term environmental impact statement used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not to say that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who is sitting at the table, and other more enlightened people had not come into contact with the phrase prior to that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from being notable for the introduction of this legislation the month of November 1974 must be remembered and be regarded as an appropriate time to contemplate the present and future status of environmental impact statements in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nation’s first few environmental impact statements have been released so that we can decide, with a reasonable amount of confidence, whether they are worth the time and expense which is involved in their preparation and, more importantly, whether they will be an adequate vehicle for bringing environmental considerations into the processes of government decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill we are debating gives the Minister power to ensure that any project of any organisation or agency or, indeed, the Commonwealth Government or any project involving Commonwealth funds within the States which is likely to have a significant effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be accompanied by an environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If clause 5 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact Proposals) Bill covers works included in programs approved by the Loan Council, it is considered inordinant delays will result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If loan works were to be made the subject of environmental impact studies the consequent delays would mean without doubt that it would be impossible for approved allocations to be expended in the same year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that preplanning, environmental impact studies and design work would have to be carried out at least a year in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether or not this legislation would lead to a duplication by the Commonwealth Government of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> assessment procedures and activities of the appropriate State organisations, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely to overcome such an attitude that the standing committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council established a working party to put forward the principles which should be observed in the assessment of the environmental effects of projects and these principles were agreed to by the Council at its last meeting late in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Victorian and the New South Wales Governments have moved as far as, if not further than, most governments in the whole of the Commonwealth to try to ensure that the procedures that are adopted with respect to environmental assessments are in fact sound, and more than just window dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, that the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council should meet as soon as possible after this legislation becomes law to ensure that there is a general acceptance of broad guidelines so that much of the necessary work is done at the regional or State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council is the essential vehicle for such agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the purpose of the Bill was stated by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in his second reading speech to be the introduction of the environmental impact study technique into the Government’s decisionmaking processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, as the Mnister stated, there has been basic agreement by State Ministers sitting on the Australian Environmental Council on what statements should cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people, I am told, would like to see its members as rubber stamps- this is in relation to the whole <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact assessment exercise- which can absorb the energies of the concerned public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others see them as advocates to Cabinet or as environmental policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A member of the Public Service” informs me that the greater part of the energies of government <span class="highlight">environment</span> bodies up to now have not been directed against pollution or even in warding off public protests, but have been expended in interdepartmental rivalry and pitched battles which are usually lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Federal Minister is in a position to allay the fears of all the State Ministers and the State governments through the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council by indicating to them that the purpose of this Bill is not necessarily to intrude into their decision making processes but to ensure that in all decisions that are taken, where Commonwealth funds are expended, the dimension of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is taken into account according to procedures that are generally agreed to between the Australian Government and the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once having done that, I am sure that we will be able to develop a degree of respect and confidence amongst the community at large for the importance of taking environmental factors into account before taking decisions on a whole range of projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is the most important environmental legislation to come before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech to the Academy of Science on 29 November the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  when he was discussing environmental impact techniques, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From now on the community is welded to the decisionmaking process as it affects the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is very little Australian literature on the technique of environmental impacts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As yet all the States do not have manuals on environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now a new department has been set up and it is combining environmental control with planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales manual points out the areas of expertise and provides a check list of the characteristics of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Council on environmental impact statements have been approved by the South Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia there is still no official policy and one can say that the need per se for an environmental impact statement is not yet fully recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously we are all in the same boat as far as environmental impact statements are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 6 to 10 concern environmental impact statement techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim is to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by 2 means- the environmental impact statement technique and the hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the aim, desire and hope of the Government is that when major development proposals are being considered it will be just as logical for business, for a government authority or a government department to make an environmental assessment as it is to make a feasibility study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I see cost benefit economic analyses or economic studies being just as much a tool for environmental impact statements as I do for economic feasibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I can see this broadening into quite a few areasinto some of the larger issues that we will face with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another problem is the problem of categorising an <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also appears to me that environmental impact statement techniques tend to ignore people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An environmental impact study was conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that with co-operation and a desire to see optimim use of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we will overcome these procedures at all levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will refer later on to certain matters which I think indicate that although this matter may be important to myself, the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt),  other honourable members on this side of the House, and particularly the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Kerin)  who preceded me, and perhaps the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  it certainly is not important to the Government as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few people could disagree with the statements of the Minister in his second reading speech when he refers to the virtues of legislation of this type, as distinct from this Bill, and its clauses, and one could be very much inclined to accept the view that to speak about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and environmental consequences when we are looking at important developments, is almost the same as speaking 10 years ago about the virtues of the family and family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the community is not prepared at the moment to accept lengthy studies and perhaps examinations by commissioners in addition to seeking approval from State planning authorities, or planning and <span class="highlight">environment</span> commissioners in the case of New South Wales, and local government authorities, and then have to meet substantial holding charges, which business has to do as distinct from governments which do not have to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In political terms it is time for this sort of legislation because members of the community are concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was particularly pleased to see the definition of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word ‘environmental’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the concept of environmental impact statements ought to be widened in the public mind to accept a social responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this definition will be more important in the future when the concept of environmental impact statements is seen to be wider, particularly when government proposals are being looked at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, who is at the table, would exercise this discretion improperly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Galston decision would clearly indicate that a government, where government interests are concerned, could arrive at a decision without regard to environmental factors and it could do so in exercising this sort of discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people have been concerned about the volume of law dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke about it in the Estimates debate involving the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen numbers of young lawyers, particularly at Sydney University, express concern at the lack of teaching at the moment of environmental law within universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in this legislation, which is the second Bill dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation which has been before this House today, there are matters relating to civil liberties which appear to be in conflict with the environmental protection and impact proposals that we have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no danger of and am not concerned at the possible duplication of environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the legislation now before the House, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that full consideration is given to the environmental factors involved in the Government’s decision-making through the use of the environmental impact statement technique and public inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout Australia there is widespread concern for the management of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> both in urban and in non-urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the regions which are the centres of agriculture, mining, services and out-of-town recreation and tourism, there is also concern about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in terms of the multiple use of resources and investment in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a pressing need for evaluations of the impact on the urban and rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past insufficient attention has been given to consideration of the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of actions flowing from decisions that were taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions for the publishing of environmental impact statements and the conduct of public inquiries are in line with the Australian Labor Party’s policy of open government, of informing the people, of enabling public participation in the decision-making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years increasing concern from all parts of the political spectrum has been expressed that inadequate consideration was being given to the environmental effect of decisions taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally, economic and technical considerations have overridden the environmental aspects of proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of our existing environmental problems of today- of noise pollution, air pollution, waste disposal, reduction of amenitywould not have arisen if there had been procedures available for a complete assessment of the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the proposed developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Sydney region, Botany Bay would still have most of its own natural qualities if environmental assessments had been carried out before industries and port developments were commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> does not belong wholly and solely to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of environmental assessment is not new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We aim through this Bill to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in 2 ways; firstly, by use of the information obtained in the environmental assessments themselves- the factors threatened, the alternatives and the best course to follow having in mind a full consideration of all factors involved; secondly, by the educative process inherent in public hearings that may be held in association with the preparation of assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people may see the need for preparation of environmental assessments as another round of red tape to be overcome- a further unnecessary cost to be incurred by the taxpayer and a possible further delay in the planning process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that, unlike the past when economic considerations were the prime considerations that influenced the decision-making process, in the future consideration of the environmental impact of proposals will take place along with the consideration of the economic features, hand in hand: that is, a parallel process, a marrying of the econ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>omics and the effect on the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the proposed development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is envisaged that proposals which could have a significant effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and which involve the Australian Government specifically or by use of grant moneys, or specified loan funds or projects which involve the constitutional powers of the Australian Governmentsuch as the woodchip industry and mining activities- will need to be examined before export licences are granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes without saying that this legislation will mean there will be considerable scope for co-operation with State environmental authorities- a complementary activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council there has already been basic agreement on what impact statements should cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it is expected that as experience in the use of the environmental assessment technique develops, a decision on whether or not a proposal should be the subject of an impact statement will become a relatively simple matter and the preparation of the statement will be part and parcel of any initial consideration of a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the Bill for participation by the people in public inquiries are of major importance and represent a victory for the supporters of community expression of concern for planning and care of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can think of no better example of the driving desire for public expression than that encompassed in the report tabled yesterday of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If environmental impact legislation had been in existence since Federation the 8-year argument over Blackbutt Reserve would have been avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation follows the greatest grass roots movements of the people in modern Australian history which has been centred around protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The time has arrived when we should survey our Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, raise our standards and change our practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must plan for the optimum control utilisation for our country to provide an acceptable <span class="highlight">environment</span> for both present and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill is termed by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  as an interim program of financial assistance to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  informed the House that the first significant Federal attention that was drawn to this problem was in February 1971 when the Australian Agricultural Council received a report from the Standing Committee on Soil Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, this demonstrates a great deal of procrastination by the Liberal Party and the Country Party in showing concern for our national resources and is a bit inconsistent with the argument that they have been putting forward recently in respect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anyone in this House was surprised to learn, when the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation stated that the precondition for the provision of this financial assistance was an agreement by the States to participate in this investigation, that, at this stage, New South Wales has not reached this agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to make some criticisms both of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation aware that in many parts of Australia the kangaroo population is estimated to be at record levels? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the first report of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation covering the period from the establishment of the Department in December 1972 to 30 June 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The school without walls has been operating to cater for children who feel that they can learn in a different <span class="highlight">environment</span> to that of the Government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question of solid waste management in Australia was one of the matters referred to the Committee on its appoinment by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the Honourable Moss Cass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council considered it appropriate to refer the question of deposits on beverage containers through the Minister to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference was however accepted as reflecting the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council and the environmental impact of beverage containers, while only part of a wider problem, does raise a number of specific issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the various State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council will support the recommendations of this Committee which were made in response to a request by them and will urge their adoption by their governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He might not agree with that, he might not say that they should be helped, but when one looks at the industries across the Australian economic scene that have been helped one sees that the ones that are most economically ill adjusted to the Australian economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> are the ones that get the most help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Environmental Physics Research Laboratories were instituted in July 1971 under the Chairmanship of  Dr. C.  H. B.

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present a report on the meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee at ministerial level on 13 and 14 November 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can honourable members tell me that any predecessor of the Prime Minister from the other side fo the House would have gone to the Soviet Union and- I will put it in pretty blunt Australian terms- had the guts to raise in that <span class="highlight">environment</span> the issue that Prime Minister Whitlam raised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was the need to evolve a new building code to take into account higher wind velocities- 1 50 miles per hour plus- the desirability of providing a better urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the uncertainties about the population to be catered for, the difficulties of land ownership and many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian society’s views of marriage and practice, notwithstanding the present trend towards equality of male and female roles, is I believe that the husband financially in the generality of cases supports his wife, while the wife supports her husband in the home <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly during the childbearing years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, has recently introduced the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill, which will apply to a much wider range of proposals than I originally suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-103">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I add that the Minister may have noticed the gratuitous comments made by the Opposition’s spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> who travelled all the way from outback New South Wales to reveal to Western Australia his ignorance of the issues involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I believe that what we have proposed is completely consistent with what we have been saying all along and is completely encompassed by the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection Act which this House in fact enacted in December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These decisions must, I would think, often have reflected the social attitudes and ideas of English judges rather than those of our own judges in Australia for, despite the idea that I think many laymen have about the law, there are many students of the law who hold that the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which judges work can often play a role in determining judicial decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I am going to throw a bouquet at the Minister ibr the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  with whom I have had numerous discussions on this Bill and other Bills under his administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank him and his Department for the courtesy and cooperation they have shown and for their genuine attempts to respond to my bipartisan- I say that sincerely- approach to matters relating to <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The regulations that flow from that legislation do not have the sort of far-reaching national and international consequences of regulations that might flow from an agreement that we could enter into with Japan, Russia, China or other countries which could not only involve the preservation of flora or fauna, but could also have a far-reaching effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a weak moment, Australia could find itself, in the euphoria of a conference, involved in some international agreement that could well limit the freedom and the rights of an individual within a community or society, for the sole purpose of trying to preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation will provide the structure, the authority and the will to create a new enthusiasm and purpose that will be the means of providing infinitely more opportunities for our society to assist and participate in the exciting rewards and satisfaction that flow from a very vibrant and creative artistic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I dunk we must all agree that there is a growing desire and interest for the enrichment, preservation and development of all aspects of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time- perhaps this is even more important -it is the responsibility of the Council to ensure that the other people, the consumers of art, who after all are the vast majority of the population, are able to appreciate the art in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> and at a cost which is to the best advantage of the majority of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, why was no officer of his Department present at that conference and symposium at which the world’s leading experts on energy resources and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> gave the benefit of their knowledge? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the nature of the gear involved, as well as the processing requirements, it is an industry which must continually seek to expand its market opportunities, particularly within an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of raging inflation of the sort to which I have already referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one of the things that worries me, because I personally am convinced that most people in Australia like to be able to plan themselves the home in which they will live, without having it forced upon them and without having the situation in which governments provide housing in the cheapest possible waywhich means uniformity of housing, lack of different designs and an unexciting <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the opponents to this Bill are trying to preserve are unstable and unhealthy marriages where the relationship has broken down and become embittered; an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which children are likely to be greatly affected and exposed to pressures and tensions that develop insecurity and anti-social behaviour later in life; and huge incomes on which some lawyers- only somespecialising in divorce proceedings wax fat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But no one can deny that a government which runs into chronic deficits in its budgeting and fiscal policy and which continues them for long is creating the atmosphere and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which inflation will run riot and which will take several years to correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer said today during question time that he was prepared to go on spending public money indefinitely to find jobs for the unemployed; yet, as the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  pointed out, each time he spends more public money in the present <span class="highlight">environment</span> he lessens job opportunities and guarantees that he will need to spend more and more moneys in order to try to bolster up jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the fact that many Australians are therefore seriously concerned and are wondering whether in fact they are getting the value from education expenditure which they would expect, the Opposition sees the need to establish an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which Australian children receive equal opportunity in education irrespective of whether they come from the cities or remote parts of the continent and regardless of the economic or social position of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the tendency has been for far too long that the recommendations of the curricula development committees of the various States have been based on the assumption that those who go to secondary school at some stage are going to find themselves in a tertiary education <span class="highlight">environment</span>, probably universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been an accepted fact of modern day planning that environmental considerations are an important dimension in any development project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was the first Prime Minister in Australia to introduce the environmental impact statement technique into decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed the Whitlam Government stated its acceptance of the EIS technique and introduced the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill 1974 on 26 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition commended the Government and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation for the legislation as indeed most environmentalists and conservationists applauded the Government’s action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are led to believe that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet contacted the Department for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation for advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Department rightly advised that no action should be taken unless an <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact study were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a callous, cynical, political decision showing no regard for the environmental protection of Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not until March this year that the truth came out, shocking the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and environmentalists everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant that the Minister for Minerals and Energy advised D. M. Minerals on 13 December- 4 days before the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act became law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, he went under the neck of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why did he not consult his colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 26 November, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill 1974 was introduced by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 17 December the Government’s <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection impact proposals legislation was proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the issue of minerals sands from Fraser bland is allowed before the issue of an EIS, and a fair opportunity given in the courts for the public to challenge any such development, what reliance can we place upon this Government’s professed concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons that I voted for your party in the last 2 Federal elections was that the ALP policy seemed to offer some hope that environmental issues within the community would be resolved by democratic- and ultimately by legalprocess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your proposals for the compulsory issue <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Impact Statements seem to go some way in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The EIS is, in the field of man/<span class="highlight">environment</span> relations, an embodyment of a truly socialist philosophy which allows the people to be subverted right from the start by permitting the export of dune sand minerals from Fraser Island before an EIS, or in defiance of its findings, you will forfeit my support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recognise the need to achieve a balance between the conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and economic growth in the knowledge that people not only demand a better <span class="highlight">environment</span> for themselves and their children but demand also jobs, better houses, better nutrition and better services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Liberal-Country Party government will invoke the principles of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation introduced by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us hope that this brutally dishonest raping of Fraser Island by a Government which has posed as being environmentally conscious marks the beginning of a new era, a new era where development at all cost, where jobs at all cost, where profits at all cost, give way to a more sensitive public determination to balance growth, jobs, profits and standards of living against the needs of posterity and the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet it introduced a Bill- and it did so with the support of the Opposition- to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from this sort of intrusion, and 4 days before its proclamation it defied its own Cabinet, its own Caucus decisions and, indeed, its own law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Little wonder that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  issued his low key Press statement on 25 March and announced the establishment of an inquiry which it was hoped would influence the mining of the approved leases on Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights to export the minerals have been given and so an inquiry is now to be held, I suppose, in the hope that the minimum amount of damage is done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to the sand dunes and the island in the course of those mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  outline the history of events dating back to the appearance on the scene of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  during the Queensland election, when he confirmed the declared attitude of the Government as being extremely interested in and responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave the people in the area and the conservationists great encouragement when he declared his attitudes and said that it was his intention to prevail on the Government to take measures to arrest the sand mining operations until such time as a proper environmental impact study could be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one else would have been more dedicated to the declared ambitions of the Labor Government in preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but he was moved to send a telegram, immediately after the declaration of the issue of licences, to the Opposition spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will yield to no one my dedication to a proper balance between mineral development and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Gwydir knows full well- he has had sufficient Parliamentary experience- that the terms of the legislation to which he gave such fulsome praise makes provision for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in relation to projects and decisions of or under the control of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Environmental impact study can be carried out under Queensland legislation, namely the State and Regional Planning and Development Public Works, Organisation and Environmental Control Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Minister for Minerals and Energy and Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation have now recommended, and I have agreed, that in future, when seeking approval for export contracts for these minerals - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The minerals are named-  derived from new sand mining ventures, the precise source from which the mineral is to be obtained should be stated together with full information concerning the environmental considerations and safeguards that have been submitted to our colleagues the Ministers for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the word ‘new ‘-  for these minerals to be accompanied by an identification of the precise source of the mineral and by evidence that the environmental consequences of the mining operations have been studied and found to be satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as this might require the preparation of environmental impact statements for submission jointly to the appropriate State and Australian Government Departments concerned, I suggest that this specific matter be referred to our respective <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Ministers at the meeting which we agreed at our Conference on 7 June should take place shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have noted your comments on the advanced stage in planning and expenditure which the company have reached before the date of my letters of 9 July to the Premiers of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, and  on  the steps being taken to ensure protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is true, will the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass),  who is supposed to be humanitarian but who laughs - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sad fact is that up till now preschooling originally intended by us as an important aid in removing or modifying inequalities of background, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, family income and family nationality- had primarily benefited children whose mothers could afford to stay at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has this situation put children from less privileged environments at an even greater disadvantage but also it has created a harmful distinction between the mother who stays at home and the mother who works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Preliminary studies of the effect of mining on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> have been carried out during the exploration phase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some of these studies were undertaken by the South Australian Department of Fisheries and reports on these studies were tabled at the recent Redcliff environmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These studies are being overviewed by the South Australian Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Thursday 21 November I was informed that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> had received from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet a copy of a letter from the Minister for Minerals and Energy dated 20 November, which indicated the Minister intended to approve an application from D. M. Minerals to negotiate an export contract (Hansard, page 1776). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed response from the Department was discussed with me and I agreed with the line taken as it was in accordance with previous Government decisions on environmental questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>method involves a thorough assessment in both the working and home <span class="highlight">environment</span> and provides a basis for social and vocational rehabilitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these preliminary remarks I want to stress that the Department of Urban and Regional Development and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will jointly administer the great task of preserving and enhancing the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also included programs to ensure that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection was the key part of the decisions of the Government, and it started a wide range of programs for the rational management of Australian land, air, water, and biological resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately the draft recommendations were known, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  and I set out to give life to the Government’s plans to protect and enhance the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has also advised the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on the implementation of the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act under which $9m was spent this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Estate program must be seen in the whole context of Government policies for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also supplements several other Acts of Parliament, including the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act and proposed legislation to create a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Estate was a concept which I devised and publicised in the days when I was a spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and urban and regional affairs for the Labor Party in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel in much stronger measure the withering away of the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> into ugly and barren patterns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also want to stress that we will seek the support of people of goodwill whatever their background to protect the National Estate and beat the bulldozer mentality that has disfigured our <span class="highlight">environment</span> for so many years and particularly during the last quarter of a century when the Opposition was in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obviously the victim of its own <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a creature of its own circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that what we are talking about when we use the term ‘home’ is a combination of a house, the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> created by the people in it and the articles of furniture which go to make living accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons that I voted for your party in the last 2 Federal Elections was that the ALP policy seemed to offer some hope that environmental issues within the community would be resolved by democratic- and ultimately by legalprocess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your proposals for the compulsory issue of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Impact Statements seem to go some way in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The EIS is, in the field of man /<span class="highlight">environment</span> relations an embodyment of a truly socialist philosophy which allows the people to express a view about the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> they live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the printing process, the words ‘to express a view about the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> they live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A copy of it was sent to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, as he was then titled, the following day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the occasion when this House was debating the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are genuinely seeking to implement our environmental impact procedures generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where I suggest that those people on both sides of the House who have contact with the States could make the point because I think the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is at risk if we do not have this sort of responsibility being shown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever any mining corporation applies for a prospecting lease or a mining lease we should, if we are all honest, make sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> departments of both the State and the Australian governments are informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that is done we may then be able to institute environmental impact procedures in co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, has already stated, when the present Government took over administration the position was already well advanced; I came in at the end of the line, not the start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that she would be asked to go back and work in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that was completely and utterly foreign to her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Government is not adhering to its policy on environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, with all due respect to the doubts of honourable members opposite, I have every confidence that we will adhere to our policies on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tomorrow my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will be introducing the Bill, under Federal powers, to make a Great Barrier Reef marine park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even at question time this morning the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  found it necessary to give us something like a 10-minute dissertation on the reasons he still believes that his <span class="highlight">environment</span> policy is intact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From them he will learn that many people in the community are concerned about what is happening on Fraser Island which involves the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Government’s policy on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so forth - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, the danger is this: When there is an economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> such as we sadly see at the moment, there are companies- we are aware that in the last few years there have been failures-with considerable assets, termed ‘book assets’ in particular, as well as assets related to their actual policies, which could be bought up by an Australian Government Insurance Corporation at very low cost indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most, if not all, companies which expect to survive in any economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and in particular the present one, would interpret sound commercial principles as based on the premise that they must return a profit, and that their costs of operation therefore must be maintained at a sufficiently low level to achieve a profit at the end of their trading period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Rolfe  fundamentally said that it is a peculiar state of affairs that in Australia which has soils that are completely different from those in Europe we have a farming system which is uniquely European and that we are forced, as it were, in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> to take the species and animal products that have been developed in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She argued both to the Agricultural Bureau and on the radio: Would it not be more sensible to look for species which are uniquely suitable to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a climate in which inflation is running at an average rate of 17.5 per cent per annum, in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which statistics released as recently as this week showing that private employment is down by 140 000 persons and public employment up by 76 000, a directly increasing burden is being placed on those who as wealth producers are finding it difficult to survive in the international markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Prime Minister table a letter dated 22 November 1974 from the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to his Department expressing opposition to the application by Dillingham-Murphyores Minerals for a licence to export minerals from sandmining operations on Fraser Island in order that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and his Department may be cleared of charges of delay and inefficiency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have nothing to add to answers which have been given already to questions on notice asked of my colleagues the Minister for Minerals and Energy and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and myself bearing upon these precise matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>) ( 10.28)- We agree with the sentiments expressed in this proposal but we have been advised that the actual terms used by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  in his proposed amendment will not quite achieve what he is setting out to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Minister alone or governments alone have little hope of protecting the National Estate or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and for that matter the National Estate, surrounds all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill states:  the national estate consists of those places, being components of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia or the cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Co-operation and co-operative effort by all sections of the community are necessary to enhance the quality of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to protect the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in times of prosperity, full employment and social security- we are all products of that situationthat a population is likely to concern itself with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in times of economic disorder and social suffering that a population is more likely to concern itself with its own social survival and to ignore the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the preservation of the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that it will take 3 years to finalise the ecological survey which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  has initiated in respect of our wet lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During my membership of the Australian Parliament, my greatest job satisfaction in the 26th Parliament has been to be  Deputy Chairman  of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation and in the 27th Parliament and the 28th Parliament to be  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We just do not have the bodies which can handle that sort of thing; nor do we have the sorts of land use bodies that can take on the environmental considerations of commercial activities- for example, forestry activities- and determine how they fit into this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the greatest sins and ravaging of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> are done in the private areas of land use in destroying a national estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that area there is a conflict between the interests of tourism, the management of an arid <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the needs of the Aboriginal people, to whom that area has tribal significance, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one looks at the National Estate program as it applies to South Australia one finds that the South Australian Minister and the Australian Government Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  have said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was dealt with in the Jordan report dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in South Australia in which it was described in this way: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This area is of great national significance and both the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren),  who are sitting at the table, have been involved in this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was in Adelaide in 1974 he said that it was the Australian Government’s responsibility to preserve areas of significance at Hallett Cove, south of Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  will look very closely at these matters because I think that this commission ought to make recommendations and that there ought to be a separate organisation to accept bequests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report will be available within the next day or two and I think an important statement will be made within a week by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  and myself and the South Australian Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> regarding certain action that we will be taking in Hallett Cove. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a constant source of amazement to me to find the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  blaming anyone from the Legislative Council to conservative forces in South Australia in relation to this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to point out 3 things: First of all, both the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  will be aware that I am very interested in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thanks to the hard work and the dedication of its members I firmly believe the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee has made a valuable contribution to the process of the public examination of important topical issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have conveyed the decision to the Minister for Minerals and Energy and also to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for their consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should also inform the House, in conclusion, that legal assistance through the Australian Legal Aid Office was given to the objector and the environmental movement right from the beginning; in the hearing before the Mining Warden, in the hearing for the writ of mandamus in the Queensland Supreme Court and right up to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Japan’s problems with pollution and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are of prime consideration to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The environmental problems of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and of all the other pollutants which come from burning hydrocarbons is such that in a small area such as Japan, this will be an inhibiting factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this is nowhere more prominent than in the issue of conservation and preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any mineral or <span class="highlight">environment</span> policies in Australia are essentially based upon co-operation between a national government with powers over export licences and State governments which have the power to issue mining licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give this example because it shows that our <span class="highlight">environment</span> policy is sound and consistent but it falls down if we cannot gain State co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government policy statement ‘A National Approach to Water Resources Management’ which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  tabled in Parliament in October sets out a broad framework and a series of objectives for a balanced approach to water resources management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was against this background that, as the Opposition shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and in association with the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  the former distinguished SolicitorGeneral, I commenced negotiations with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to give more consideration to Queensland in the personnel to be appointed to the all-important Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim of the Bill is to preserve the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the questions that has to be considered in relation to this measure and particularly clause 65 is whether it bases itself soundly in constitutional power, because it would be tragic if Australia and this Parliament had no power to control the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right of movement over the high seas has to be taken into account, and therefore what might seem on the face of it a very wide regulation-making power, in order to stay within validity, should be read down so that the measures that are taken are clearly relevant to the protection and the conservation of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case there be any doubt I suggest that one of our efforts in the law of the sea discussions should be to achieve a situation where coastal States have either a right or an obligation to preserve the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> around their shores, not unrealistically and not without regard to the rights of fishermen, traditional or otherwise, but having regard to the fact that it is part of the heritage of Australia and indeed of the world beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, these are to build a new and permanent Parliament House and to ensure parliamentary control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> surrounding it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is becoming increasingly obvious that one of the major factors affecting the quality of the education provided is the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which that education is being given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Money can go some way towards providing this <span class="highlight">environment</span>, although as we are always aware from the growing concern over the illiteracy rate, it is not the sole answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">environment</span> is also achieved by the purchase of equipment such as projectors and duplicators and all sorts of material that can be used by teachers to capture their pupils’ interest and for greater personal involvement by the students in their own education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The lowest of all the appropriations is the appropriation for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, for which an amount of $7,703,000 has been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is a very new department whereas Parliament is a very old institution going back for centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Berinson)  made reference to a number of inadequacies with respect to the researching of material which is to be considered in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What about questions of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which was a ragtag attachment to a Minister who had a number of things to deal with? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previous letters have been written to, the then, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-  Mr Kavenagh  the Minister for Police and Customs, and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> (who was approached through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs) because the main source of liquor comes from the East Alligator River ‘ Border Store ‘, which is within the proposed Kakadu National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that the Department of Labor and Immigration has taken the suggestion aboard but I hope that in the not too distant future the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will turn his attention to this possibility and that his Department will take the opportunity to use this wool store, which is lying empty, to try to provide worthwhile employment opportunity and training for many of the young people who, because they have no trade, will have to drift into Redfern or elsewhere in Sydney away from their own <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The table indicates the low call on legal aid for environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me illustrate with an example the misunderstanding about what legal aid is and its availability for environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  announced that assistance to the value of about $5,000 to $6,000 would be given to a woman at Ferntree Gully to fight against quarry operations which were allegedly despoiling the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and encroaching onto the communal rights of nearby residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interpretation was that the Australian Government interfered in areas outside its concern and it sided with the woman and the environmentalists, whereas the facts were that after the woman had established that she had a  prima facie  case against the quarry company she required legal assistance, to take her case to the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In speaking to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> I would like to take this opportunity to thank the former Ministers especially the previous Minister who is now Minister for the Media  (Dr Cass)  and the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Berinson)  for the co-operation they have extended to me on matters related to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in a period of 12 months I have had the privilege, for want of a more courteous expression, to shadow no less than 4 Ministers, namely,  Dr Cass, Dr J.  F. Cairns, then the Prime Minister and now the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Mr Berinson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1, expenditure by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for 1975-76 is shown as $7,703,000 as against $8,893,439 in 1974-75 and $8,243,437 in 1973-74. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I have said,  Mr Chairman,  you will appreciate that it is very difficult to speak to the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and environmental issues when it is so hard to work out the total appropriation and the funding for this important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Is it necessary to present the Department’s estimates in such an involved and fragmented way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I address myself to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sum of $ 1 ,000 was made available for an investigation into the environmental aspects of the establishment of a radiation laboratory at Yallambie in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span> made $5,000, 1 think, available to the Town and Country Planning Association of Victoria to enable a project on waste disposal in Melbourne to be carried out and a report to be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In biological history, no organism has survived long if its <span class="highlight">environment</span> became in some way unfit for it, but no organism before man has deliberately polluted its own <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say something later on about the methods by which we dispose of wastes, but little or no thought has been given to the following: Have methods been in harmony with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, in enabling reports like this to be prepared and in assisting residents of areas to get information that they can put before government departments, is doing a great service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have got to the stage of life where I can give the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Berinson)  some kind of fatherly advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with a Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> that cannot grasp a nettle such as this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Estimates debates are too fragmented for use as a platform for any real discussion of our attitude as a nation to environmental and conservation matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is too simple to accept the impression that concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> now is so widespread that the battle, at least in principle, has been won; that it is just a matter of sorting out the details; that we are not in fact in an area of political dispute, as the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  put it to us earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, as one of what he called the colourful figures passing him by, I think I can say with confidence, and in the hope that I have not yet passed him by, that <span class="highlight">environment</span> is one of our most highly contentious areas and as a result one of our most political areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That arises simply from the fact that environmental questions come up so often on the basis of competing interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of field in which anyone with the responsibility for <span class="highlight">environment</span> finds himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally let me say this to honourable members as I believe it will be of interest to them: A great deal of the work of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is a bit like the iceberg with only a small amount of it appearing above the surface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In rising to speak on the appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I wish to direct my remarks to the sum of $315,000 set aside for the costs associated with public hearings held as part of the preparation of environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expenditure is quite necessary if the full intentions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act are to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that the public be involved if forward planning and successful protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental impact statement approach goes a long way towards achieving this end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The planning and <span class="highlight">environment</span> Ministers in the Hamer Government,  Mr Hunt  and  Mr Borthwick,  have come under partly unjustified attack to the point where  Mr Hunt  was forced in exasperation to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in similar terms to the platform of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party’s own platform provides for ‘recognition that effective and sensible land use planning is essential to provide for orderly development, preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and maintain and enhance the quality of life ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Australian Government would require an environmental impact statement on programs which involve expenditure of Australian Government money- that is, where the money is identifiable as being Australian Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An environmental impact study would need to take into account many factors, including the impact of the proposal on the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the flora and fauna, and man made materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would need to take into account also the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> such as health, employment, safety, the community, recreation and privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the publication of such an environmental impact statement resulted in public comments which questioned whether the proposal had been considered adequately, then the Minister could call for a public inquiry to follow, although I suspect, and it is expected, that only a small proportion of such statements would result in public inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is anxious that people be encouraged to participate fully in decisions which affect their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, finance is being provided to <span class="highlight">environment</span> centres and conservation organisations to enable them to co-ordinate the activities of community groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government had cooperated with the State Government to bring about the re-organisation of the quarry operations in the Dandenongs also to minimise the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both parties thought that their plan was the best one to minimise the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extremely important that that sort of assistance be given by the Australian Government and that environmental impact studies and public inquiries be carried out if all people in the community are to have their rights observed and the community rights observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, particularly because yesterday the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> published a report dealing with coastal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results may form the basis of an environmental impact study if the proposal for a highway is to be taken further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a responsibility to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected, to make its own assessment and judgment on whether or not this area of land, unique as it is within metropolitan Perth, should be preserved as it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, both from a personal and a political interest, I think it is of great national importance that this report of the Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has been brought down, advocating as it does a national coastal protection policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once more I must praise him, and particularly so today for bringing to the attention of this chamber the report of the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in respect of coastal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has recently concluded a reference in respect of future land use in the Jervis Bay area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the hearings of that Committee the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> brought forward a submission relating specifically to coastal lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly trust that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Berinson)  and his Department will take the recommendations of this Committee into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very important that a department working in an area such as <span class="highlight">environment</span> should constantly adjust and not become too rigid because we are dealing very much with an area concerned with value judgments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the most important pieces of legislation introduced into the House in the current Parliament was that relating to environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many environmental impact statements are now under way and I foresee that in the future there may be some need to look at the way that these measures have worked out in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee has enabled the members of it in particular to assess the way that people involved in the conservation movement, from the Department down to individuals, are thinking and developing their thoughts on all matters concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the way that the Government can involve itself at all levels in the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> said, the States are co-operating with respect to national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table shows that the States are trying to incorporate their legislation into one Act that will cover all aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In rising to speak to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Department of Tourism and Recreation I would firstly like to refer to a point made by the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Lamb). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the Government an assurance that when there is a change of government the present Opposition certainly will carry out the same policy in regard to environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted with interest one particular item when looking at the proposed expenditure for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in the Appropriation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the areas under the control of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is that relating to impact statements on the acquisition or use of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An environmental impact statement issued on the land in that area has shown that it is environmentally not practicable or desirable that homes should be built in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> he has an indirect responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who is at the table, to take note of this matter because these people are in need of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the various honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Lamb)  who has been a member, and is now  Chairman,  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member has recently accepted the chairmanship of the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, one of whose reports was the subject of comment by the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advise the honourable member for Stirling that, as a fellow Western Australian, apart from being Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I will certainly be looking with great interest at any proposals on the highway to which he referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been a change in the pattern of behaviour and incidence of disease it is far more likely to be due to an established change in the chemical <span class="highlight">environment</span> than to any alleged social or economic factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been an environmental change related to industry and to the motor vehicle, but there is nothing new about stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social and economic factors have remained substantially constant or have improved; the <span class="highlight">environment</span> has not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Man has to live within his <span class="highlight">environment</span> and I hope that this Government and future governments will do what they can to encourage not only the universities but also private industry to take a very real interest in the social sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However in May 1975 the South Australian Minister of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Mr Broomhill,  and the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Dr Cass,  agreed to issue a joint statement setting out details of those proposals for which  Dr Cass  had agreed in principle to provide financial assistance under the  States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act  1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have written to the South Australian Minister of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation advising him of my desire to conclude agreements this financial year for the Murrays Lagoon program, a program at Pike River-Gurra Gurra Lakes and in respect of certain other lands for which no agreement to make a public statement has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not follow, however, that the Budget objective of maintaining an <span class="highlight">environment</span> conducive to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected by such a development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following that, preparation of the draft environmental impact statement was begun by the Department of Science and was published in February this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final environmental impact statement was begun in March 1975 and cleared by the then Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in May 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation of which I am a member is conducting an inquiry at present into packaging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This expansion of the packaging industry is not only major in its impact on the comsumer and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but also it would appear to be almost out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consumer is paying heavily for the present packaging of goods and so too is our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people see the population explosion, diminishing food, resources, the destruction of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and thermo-nuclear annihilation as the most immediate threats to our continued existence on this planet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, I ask that the needs of these services be referred to other Government departments, if necessary, such as the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which possibly could ascertain whether they could give some assistance to these services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very necessary for any Minister for Defence, for any government, to maintain a continuous review of the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the strategic situation so that any threats that do emerge can be monitored in terms of lead times and warning times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is realistic assessments of the sort of threats that may affect Australia and its <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of progress in the improvement of the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be drastically slowed down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper planning with due regard to all human factors and environmental factors will result in sensible balanced development; efficient utilisation of our natural resources; gradual creation of a better life style; preservation of the desirable features of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>; and the restoration and preservation of our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will read some of the headings: Urban expansion and redevelopment, urban services, transport in urban areas, housing, the urban and regional <span class="highlight">environment</span>, community and regional services, and the location of Australian Government activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to do that then clearly we are dealing with a wide-ranging area involving transport, housing, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a sensitivity towards our heritage, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been clear from the outset that the Torres Strait Islanders shared with the Government of Queensland a general reluctance to see any change in the present location of the border, in the status and rights of Torres Strait Islanders as Australian citizens, but that in addition they attached great, perhaps even over-riding, importance to the protection of the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Torres Strait which they saw not merely as the basis of their livelihood but of their characteristic and independent way of life <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Islanders would therefore prefer that the border be not changed and the present status of the Islands, of their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and of the Islanders be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They believe that the Governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea could work out a form of joint control which would be adequate in a zone where the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the embargo on mining and oil drilling would make many of the issues requiring the exercise of sovereignty unlikely or less difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present two reports entitled ‘An Exploratory Study of Canberra-Goulburn Airport’ and ‘An International Airport in the Canberra-Goulburn Region to Serve the City of Sydney- Assessment of Likely Effects on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I bring up the report of the Committee on development pressures on Jervis Bay <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on development pressures on Jervis Bay is concerned with areas of the electorate of Fraser, capably represented by my colleague,  Mr Fry,  and my electorate of Macarthur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has reached agreement on findings and recommendations which have been presented to the Parliament and if implemented will ensure that at least that part of our coastline in the Jervis Bay area will be available for the use and enjoyment of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the report concerns a specific localised area with its own particular problems, the Committee has attempted to set down guidelines which could give a lead to land use planning in other areas, particularly where conflicts have occurred or are possible between environmental and various other interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the developments taking place on the fringes of our cities provide, in certain respects, an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that can be equally depressing and restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had a number of consultations with my colleagues, the Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Berinson)  on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the second amendment is to make it clear in a case involving a question of public importance or the preservation of the national <span class="highlight">environment</span> that where the provision of legal assistance is not otherwise authorised- under the Act legal aid may be provided if the special criteria to be prescribed by the regulations are satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that if a person has a public interest action involving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, irrespective of whether that person complies with the eligibility criteria that a person with a private action might have to comply with, that person might become eligible for legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  has pointed this up very well in referring to the proposed amendment to sub-clause (4) of clause 29 which relates to matters of public importance and matters affecting the protection, maintenance or preservation of the natural or cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regulations will prescribe the circumstances where it is considered that legal assistance ought to be given in matters of public importance or matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Groups within the community concerned about the impact of an export industry or of the construction of highways on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may wish to bring either an individual or a collective action to try to control the damage which will be done, as they see it, by such an industry or by such a thing as a highway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two of these determinations relate to the Secretary to the Postmaster-General’s Department, the Australian National Railways Commission, the Commissioner for Community Relations, commissioners under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 974, the Road Safety and Standards Authority, the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, the Schools Commission and the Health Insurance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That honourable members have, by and large, taken this approach in the past is evident through the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee on the Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ecological survey currently being funded by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is expected to provide accurate assessment of the present extent of rainforests and other plant communities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1973-74 financial year for example, $1,250,000 from my Department’s ‘Machinery of Government’ vote was expended on an advertising campaign which included advertisements on the workings of Parliament and on community/Government joint responsibilities in areas such as migrant assimilation and pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government quite obviously realises, as the Minister stated, that in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> it has created, it is impossible accurately to plan ahead with any certainty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We made a further $50,000 available to try to catch up with the environmental problems that the sewerage problems were creating in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) and (2 ) As pan of its environmental public awareness program the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in February 1975 commissioned Spectrum International Marketing Services Pty Ltd to carry out an exploratory research study to determine current public awareness of and examine attitudes to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report of the study, entitled ‘Public Attitudes to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’, was presented to the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on 30 April 1975 and tabled in both Houses on 20 August 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What needs now to be understood is that when this sort of activity is undertaken efforts need to be made to ensure that damage is not caused to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the future, taking account not only the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as it exists at the time but also the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as it may exist with the development that takes place in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that, but the whole point about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is that little mistakes build up into a great bundle of mistakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why we in the Department of Urban and Regional Development and also the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> look into every interrelationship, try not to minimise issues and try to look at the broad picture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to thank the officers in the Department of Urban and Regional Development, the Department of Capital Territory and the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> who were able to work with their counterparts in the States in order to try to solve this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government will certainly act, in concert with State governments and other authorities, to protect the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, whether it is man-made or natural, if it is deemed to be desirable in the interests of future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The choice is between, on the one hand, restoring fully the real incomes of those who do have jobs at the risk of throwing some of them out of work and on the other hand providing an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the recent slight strengthening in consumer and business confidence will continue and more job opportunities will become available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raised this question because the text of a letter from the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  was published on the front page of the  Sydney Morning Herald  of 14 February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Prime Minister give me details of his strategy in creating the super department by the amalgamation of the Departments of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Urban and Regional Development and then pulling out its teeth by excluding it from the Economic Committee of Cabinet thus excluding this new department from having any say in Cabinet on economic aspects even though it is responsible for fixation investment in the cities of Australia which represent 85 per cent of the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable gentleman should well understand that matters which affect the individual in his <span class="highlight">environment</span>, whether it is the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> and matters which affect community development all round Australia have been brought within one department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only substantive statement that I can find by the Liberal Party on the Department of Community Development- it is now administered by  Senator Greenwood  who is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development- was issued on 10 May 1974 by the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Snedden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The references to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and other matters to which Labor has subscribed and in which we share with it in aspiration but differ from it in technique, is clear evidence of the fact that we want growth and want to assist the underprivileged and disadvantaged with maximum freedom for them, maximum freedom of choice and maximum human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no knowledge of what the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development may or may not have recommended in relation to this matter, but I indicate to the honourable gentleman, who ought to know, that it is the Government which makes policy in these matters, not any one department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A colleague of mine in the Queensland State Parliament,  Mr David  Byrne, summed up the situation by saying recently in that place:  ‘A depressed <span class="highlight">environment</span> is self-perpetuating; a depressed society is self-destructive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation was first appointed in May 1973 as the result of a recommendation by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since its inception the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has inquired into many issues of importance for environmental protection and has produced several valuable reports, including those on the environmental impact of freeways, the Blackbutt Reserve, the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Act 1967-72, and development pressures on Jervis Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recommending the continuance of this Committee I remind honourable members of the urgency which is being felt by the general public about environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The long term consequences of our actions must be recognised and present environmental problems solved if we are to have any control over the future quality of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past the existence of standing committees has enabled the House of Representatives to be involved in initial and formative consideration of a wide range of major environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  should look very seriously at the expenditure commitments that may be entered into on such a long term basis if we try to follow through the pattern of the expenditure proposals of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All parties realise that the recommendation of the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation for the setting up of a standing committee on environmental matters was a sensible one, and so everyone co-operated in the setting up of that committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is only fitting that the national Parliament should take a deep interest in matters affecting our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is my firm belief that our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its conservation should be the concern of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are various agencies throughout the State governments for the control of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the main these groups do an excellent job in our communities and keep a watchful eye on these very important matters of conservation and <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are also extremely interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, even more so than most people in our communities would give them credit for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the States have legislation requiring local authorities to demand environmental impact studies to be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the subjects that were selected by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and discussed at some length by the Committee were of extreme importance to the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was pointing out to the House some of the inquiries that had been conducted by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in the 28th and the 29th Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of the previous Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I say to honourable members that sitting on the committee was an education that should not be taken lightly by honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that there has been considerable despoilment of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that man has interfered with and endangered many species of plant, bird and animal life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one adds to the Commonwealth and Housing Commission ownerships all the land owned by the State Government and other State instrumentalities, such as the Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Commission, which land is non-ratable, one sees that in the case of Penrith there is a further rate loss of an estimated $ 190,737. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New areas of advanced technology with astronomically high costs, the requirement of preserving and improving the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the constant erosion of balance sheets by inflation are some of the causes which clearly reveal that the risks to private industry are growing even faster than the need for capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House hold this simple belief: An <span class="highlight">environment</span> must be created in which every Australian can plan confidently for the prospect of having his own special piece of Australia- his own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Housing objectives can be achieved by the States on a mutually cooperative basis with private enterprise but it is most difficult and almost impossible when restraints and controls are imposed by people from a centralised point who are completely unaware of the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The constraints on our potential for population growth are not so much those of our natural resources as of the need to ensure a continuing improvement in living and working standards, the avoidance of short-term pressures on our infra-structures, the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the avoidance of pockets of disadvantaged persons and groups, the need to ensure the retention of a cohesive Australian community with scope for cultural, ethnic and individual diversity and the availability of the sorts of migrants the Australian community requires and wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention this,  Mr Speaker,  because it is becoming increasingly obvious that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we live in, is emerging as a great political and humane issue and the motor car may play a different role in the next 25 years, related to the role it has played in the last 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not dealing with shadows in this matter, we are dealing with substance, and whilst one can appreciate the great necessity to cut expenditure in the present economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> it is to be hoped that funds will be made available in co-operation with the States on a long term continuing basis to overcome this serious problem which will engulf us unless controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the aegis of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, agreement has been reached between the States and the Federal Government on the measures needed to achieve standardisation of methods, of measurements, types of pollutants to be measured and formats for recording data. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am authorised by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to say it is his expectation that he will, in the present session, make a statement to Parliament which sets out the Government’s broad attitude to the world <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which this country must shape its policies and its relations with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the meantime there is no reason why we should not be using what we have in the Department of Construction and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to get on with the task of putting into production unused capacity in the building industry of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My ninth point is that the lesser amounts in specific grants to the States for hospitals are well short of last year’s figure in real terms; for education, well short of recommendations by the education commissions; for railways, even the Adelaide-Crystal Brook line is questioned, as is the standard gauge program generally which seems now to be a thing of the past for this government; for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, slashed by over $400m, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At one stroke the Government is condemning millions of Australians to secondrate housing, second-rate transport and a second-rate <span class="highlight">environment</span> in second-rate suburbs and towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a policy which says to the States and local government: ‘If you want to improve the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, pay for it yourself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a reduction in forward estimates of over $400m in the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the worst of these is poor nutrition and that this should be so prevalent in a fertile <span class="highlight">environment</span> is most alarming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the urban affairs area the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development have been reduced by $400m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government used Canberra to demonstrate the advantages of physical and social planning in providing modern urban conditions in a healthy rural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in providing adequate housing, transport and recreation facilities as well as health and education services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From today the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Newman)  will act as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The detailed appropriation of revenue in the Supply Bills does not give very much indication of what the Government will do in the next Budget but there are 2 areas in particular- the appropriation for Aborigines and the appropriation for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development- which draw to our attention once again the unfortunate statement of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  which was made on Thursday of last week, in which he announced such devastating cuts in so many areas of government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before moving on to deal with that overall strategy, let me mention the other appropriation to which I have already alluded- that for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">environment</span> development, what housing development or what community development will there be after the drastic reduction in funds that is apparent in both of the Supply Bills? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the details of the Supply Bills and say that particularly in the areas of appropriations for Aborigines and appropriations for <span class="highlight">environment</span>, housing and community development, we see the first signs of real cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I count this as a very important manifestation of the results of the work of the Wool Corporation because what we can begin to look at now is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is being created in which the next logical steps can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor, in developing its regionalism concept, recognised that the individual living standards of the average family, especially in environmental and cultural terms, depend more on the initiatives and efficiency of local government than on the initiative and efficiency of either State or Federal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that local government provides the opportunity for competitive diversity in those qualities of life which Australian families would like to see achieved in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Acting Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing, and Community Development whether the environmental impact statement on the Concorde has been exempted from the requirements under the administrative procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development I ask: In view of his answer to the question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and in accordance with the administrative procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act, when was the final environmental impact statement prepared by the proponent, which I take it was British Airways? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, I think that I, as Minister responsible for the decision ultimately to allow Concorde to come to Australia, should answer the question asked by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From our own point of view the primary concern is an international <span class="highlight">environment</span> which could progressively limit the capacities of Australia, her friends, and allies, to advance their interests and ideals, which reduces options, which almost imperceptibly weakens the capacity to pursue our interests and advance the cause of human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This phobia about Russian ships is presumably the justification for defence expenditure of $ 12,000m over the next 5 years- for a 5.5 per cent per annum increase in real terms in the defence budget at the expense of funds for health, cities, roads, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, child care, education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the present Government has so far continued the national air monitoring program through this Bill, and while the then Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr MacKellar)  indicated his personal support for improved air quality monitoring in his second reading speech, what does the future hold for this program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The events of the last 6 months make me doubt whether the Government will give environmental matters the high priority they deserve, particularly when public health and safety is involved, let alone the protection of our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week’s decision to allow the Concorde to fly to and from Australia without preparation of a final environmental impact statement is just one reason why I doubt the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The way in which the Fraser Government abolished large numbers of positions in the former Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> when it was made a part of the new Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the Government to appoint commissioners to the Heritage Commission and giving it very little financial muscle, the low priority it has given to the preservation of the national estate as witnessed by the Budget measures announced 10 days ago and its failure to appropriate any money for the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the supply Bills last week are just some reasons why all Australians must doubt this Government’s integrity on environmental issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Simple solutions are achieved only by ignoring the interconnections of all areas of human endeavour and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One hundred years ago nobody could have foreseen the pattern of environmental crisis which was to develop in our society as we became industrialised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, in its report on the environmental effects of supersonic transport aircraft, added a proviso to the recommendation that the Government should not prohibit the operations of Concorde in terms of the necessity to have continuous and extensive monitoring of the stratosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should respect the fragility of certain water and atmospheric environments and should ensure a thorough environmental appraisal before taking firm decisions on policies and strategies for industrial location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can go further and so plan our urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> to encourage pedestrian movement and the use of nonmotorised nonmotorised transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has become directly involved in the global <span class="highlight">environment</span> monitoring system of the United Nations to develop a means of monitoring trends in global air pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environmental Program in 1973, a baseline air pollution monitoring station is being developed by the Commonwealth in southern Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few years the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee of OECD has pioneered an international effort on policies for the control of the rapidly developing problem of photochemical oxident air pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council has recognised this need for co-operation in preparing the national air monitoring program in which agreement has been reached for participation by all State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate we are considering one of the major environmental problems of this century- pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see it brought forward because it represents an initiative started while I was Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in the last Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This creates, in the end product of its metabolism, if you like, the things we see as pollution because they cannot be dissipated or absorbed by the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we succeed in getting data to show what we are doing to our <span class="highlight">environment</span> then hopefully it will be easier to proceed to the next steps and deal with other aspects of what we like to call pollution but which really is an abuse of the basic biological life cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must observe that questions on <span class="highlight">environment</span>, housing and community development seem much more popular than questions on repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s failure to observe the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-1975 before granting the British Airways permission to fly Concorde to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making that announcement the Minister for Transport failed to comply with the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  colleague, the then Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr MacKellar)  also failed to comply with the requirements of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of both Ministers to comply with those requirements, coupled with the events of the past 6 months, makes me doubt whether this Government will give environmental matters the priority they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was, in the first instance, the abolition of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That not only entailed the abolition of many positions in the former Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, but also meant that the role the Federal Government was playing in environmental matters had decreased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the other more startling actions of this Government in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and a matter which is indirectly related to the subject of the debate today, was its high-handed action in directing  Mr Justice  Fox to complete the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry by May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That direction, like the decision last week, was in complete contravention of the legislative requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion that this Government not only does not have any commitment to the preservation and improvement of the natural and built <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also does not even understand the most important environmental Act it has to administer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enactment of this legislation by the Whitlam Labor Government is the only example of formalising environmental assessment requirements into statuterequirements that most Australians want followed, not ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act defines the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to include ‘all aspects of the surroundings of man whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groupings’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that definition was to ensure that the use of the Act was not to be confined to matters affecting the physical or natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 6 of the Act provided a framework for the introduction of the details of the environmental assessment procedure requirements by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These regulations were ignored by both the Minister for Transport and the then Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 8.1 states that if any written comments are received on the draft environmental impact statement those comments must be taken into account by the proponent in the preparation of a final environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 8.2 provides that the final environmental impact statement, when prepared, will be circulated to interested bodies, including the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and those people who made comments on the draft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 9.1 provides that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development shall examine the final environmental impact statement on behalf of its Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those regulations, as I have already said, require the proponent to prepare and circulate a final draft environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After it has been circulated, the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development must examine the final statement on behalf of its Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not been done even though I am informed that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development had many questions to ask British Airways if its final <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statement did not satisfactorily dispel many major doubts raised by concerned Australians such as the Society for Social Responsibility in Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some blame must be placed on the former Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Minister responsible for the administration of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a former Minister who was closely associated with the departments that now form the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, I have no doubt that the officers of that department advised the former Acting Minister to ensure that the procedures were followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for Transport maintains that his actions were legal and that the former Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development agreed that there was no need for these procedures to be followed, I call on the Minister for Transport to table the letter that is required under the legislation to have been sent to him by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development under regulations 11.1 and 1 1.4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has blatantly ignored the legislative requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, as the honourable member for Reid said, the British Government, the British Aircraft Corporation and British Airways produced a draft environmental impact statement on Concorde operations in Australia dated December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This view was supported eventually by my colleague, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and former Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am writing to confirm the agreement we have reached today following our consultation in accordance with the Administrative Procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am writing to confirm the agreement we have reached today following our consultation in accordance with the Administrative Procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974-75 on the necessity or otherwise of holding a public environmental enquiry on the operation of the Concorde aircraft into Australia, in particular to Tullamarine Airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setting this aspect aside, the wider consequences on the global <span class="highlight">environment</span> have been well canvassed in enquiries in other countries and at this time I do not believe that further knowledge would be gained by traversing these issues again in an Australian environmental enquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter confirms that in the judgment of the then Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, on the information that had been made available there was no need for a public inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British High Commission again confirmed that the draft impact statement with some minor editorial changes will be the final environmental impact statement on the question of Concorde visits to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words this is the impact statement, with an addendum covering the submissions that have been made on it by Australians, upon which the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development made their judgment that there is no cause for a public inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That becomes the final <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact study and it has been available since December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will give the operators notice, under due process, when we are satisfied about the environmental impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit most strongly that no case exists on the allegations made about any breach of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In reply to my question yesterday to the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  he quoted a letter received by him from the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 5 of our Act specifies ‘that matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to a significant extent’ should be fully examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the United Kingdom and the United States of America required an environmental impact statement would confirm that our own legislation is not excessive on this score. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, in section 6 it is indicated that, in order to fulfil this requirement to examine fully and take into account environmental effects, certain administrative procedures must be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 8 (b) indicates that each Minister shall do all that is necessary, consistent with relevant laws, ‘for ensuring that any final environmental impact statement’- I emphasise the words ‘final environmental impact statement’- ‘formulated in accordance with those procedures, and any suggestions or recommendations made in accordance with those procedures, are taken into account, in matters to which they relate, in the department administered by him and by any authority of Australia in respect of which he has ministerial responsibilities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The revised draft EIS becomes the final EIS and, according to section 8.2, the proponent is to provide 5 copies to the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, a copy to a commissionerif there had been a public hearing-and copies to any department, authority of Australia, State, State authority, local authority or any person or body which has submitted written com: ments on the draft EIS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, on the Minister’s own admission, the final EIS has not yet been received by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 9.1 of our procedures requires the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to examine the final environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Transport could have asked the former Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development for an exemption from the requirements of the procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps, in accordance with section 11.2, the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development consulted the Department of Transport concerning the request for exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note the letter that the Minister for Transport received from the former Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, which says, in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looks to me as though the former Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has made the mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In rising as the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and therefore the one concerned in the application of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, I have certain difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I have had only a short time to acquaint myself with the provisions of this Act and the responsibilities of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important, first of all, to summarise the administrative procedures that are required under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be, first of all, a draft environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 18 months from the tabling of our second report on roads and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Commitee held 27 public hearings and took more than 5000 pages of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have conducted research into factors affecting vehicles, roads, the road <span class="highlight">environment</span>, road-user behaviour and the inter-relationship between them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to road <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Authority staff and interested bodies would have had access to off-road facilities which would have enabled comprehensive testing under controlled conditions of such things as breakaway poles, guard railing and crash barriers which would yield on impact and reduce the likelihood of injury to vehicle occupants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appeal to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Newman),  to ensure that the programs commenced or enlarged by the Whitlam Government for the young people of Australia are maintained at least at the present level for 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since those 2 statements we have seen the youth, sport and recreation sections hidden in the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made a speech during the adjournment debate last night in which I asked the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to see that the allocations of funds to sports, youth and recreational organisations are continued in the 1976-77 Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is the responsibility of government to help provide the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the answers can be determined basically by the market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr MacKellar)  said in his second reading speech: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr MacKellar)  said in the second reading speech, if a person attracts a grant for a home under the homes savings grant scheme and the home is for the purposes of rental or sale, provided the person has never had a home before he can go on to rent it or to sell it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People are now fighting against the wanton destruction and pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and fighting for the preservation of natural assets and beauty spots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> normally involves an economic cost, at any rate in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental issues must be one of the factors considered in each decision, together with other factors such as the economic cost and community convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has attempted in too many cases to give environmental issues an effective veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is as unbalanced and undesirable a situation in the opposite direction as it was when environmental issues were not considered at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In furtherance of the objective of ensuring that matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are fully examined and taken into account, the Government has given very careful consideration to a classified draft environmental impact statement prepared by the Department of Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, in order that maximum possible information, consistent with the interests of Australia be made available to the public, a document titled ‘Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia’ dated May 1976 is attached to this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is taking these decisions on the basis of international experience with nuclear powered warships and in light of the assessments in the unclassified environmental document which I am tabling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepts the expert advice that the risk of an incident resulting in a release of radio-activity is extremely low and the hazard to human health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is remote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those matters are dealt with in detail in the document ‘Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriate arrangements concerning environmental safeguards will be applied in consultation with state governments by a group of officials led by officials of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I looked at these matters as Prime Minister and as Foreign Minister, and for a while as <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Minister, on 2 grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the environmental aspects, both Commonwealth and State, had not yet been investigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I wish to make this point: Towards the end of last year the position had arisen in consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> where my Government was about to make an approach to the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia, to consult them about the environmental aspects of nuclear powered ships- in this case nuclear powered allied warships- visiting their ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it is very important that the State governments should be involved in the question of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">environment</span> was not one that the Australian Government could solve in isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, of course, do not assert- it would be most uncharacteristic of me to assert- that the Australian Government did not have constitutional authority in matters of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> arising out of defence or trade with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also a House of Representatives Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation; it is not required to keep confidences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise in this debate to forward the proposition explained by the then Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr MacKellar)  and the previous speakers from the Government side and to rebut some of the spurious arguments advanced by members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even at this late stage once again I make a special appeal to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to see whether it is possible to make retrospective payments to people who built their homes and, on account of” inflation, exceeded the $22,500, even by the sum of $400 or $500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements that I have announced show our determination to achieve a responsible balance between conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They show also our concern to work with the States and the voluntary bodies, and indeed with the whole community for the improvement of environmental and conservation standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ever since the 1930s the defence planners have looked at the problems of Australia in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live but very little consideration was given to the territorial defence of the continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he not realise that when the squeeze comes our friends in Treasury say that if there is one place in which they can really use the knife it is <span class="highlight">environment</span> and urban and regional development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as in urban affairs and as with our national heritage, everything is connected to everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Labor was in office the then Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the current Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  and the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson),  both publicly stated in the debate last year on the Heritage Commission that it was necessary to appropriate funds before a formal register was completed to preserve those immediately threatened areas of our national estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the pressure will still be on back benchers opposite to ensure that that commitment is met, because all we have done to date is buy the internal fittings of the Palace Hotel, which in fact are in the custody of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The programs to which I referred earlier also include endeavours to ensure that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection forms the key part of the decision-making process of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was done by the enactment of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation, and the appointment of permanent heads of departments that had special environmental significance to the Interim Committee on the National Estate, apart from conditions embodied in the legislation currently being amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not be surprised to see legislation introduced into this Parliament shortly to amend the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that is why we wanted to work together- the Australian and State governments, local government, the private sector, the people’s sector, people’s organisations and the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who represents the electorate of Gwydir, reflected this Government’s view of the Australia Heritage Commission Bill when as the then Opposition spokesman for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for that matter the National Estate surrounds all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be no doubt that this Government has reiterated its firm and unequivocal commitment to the preservation and maintenance of that part of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, our National Estate, having asthetlc historical, scientific and social significance for future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any commitment of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> which would form part of the National Estate and appear on the register in accordance with the terms of the Act is in danger of destruction, despoliation or is in any way adversely affected, the Government must take immediate and urgent steps, on the advice of the Commission, to preserve or maintain that component. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There unfortunately has been a tendency of late to label those in our community who support conservation or express concern for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- our National Estate- as freaks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The majority of people in Australia are concerned with the quality of their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and are able to make assessments of the environmental aspects of any project likely to threaten that quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is much to be learnt from the United States experience and it is pleasing to note that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  and the Commission have examined this and other overseas examples and are very well aware of the requirement and work necessary to establish the register. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was to advise the Ministers- that was the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>- on legislation to create an Australian heritage commission, on grants from the 1974 National Estate financial assistance programs and on any other matters related to National Estate issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’s program on grants to conservation bodies, amounting to $448,000 was a recommendation of the Interim Committee as was the program of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for acquisition of land for nature conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  must accept responsibility for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact having been acknowledged at the first meeting of the Commission, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  said that the Commission had no doubt that the Government was committed to policies which would protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add that the then Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development announced that $9m will be provided in 1976-77 to meet forward commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development (or the relevant predecessor Department of Urban and Regional Development) was also represented on each occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to quote the statement made by the present Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  when he was then spokesman for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in times of prosperity, full employment and social security that a population is likely to concern itself with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in times of economic disaster and social suffering that a  population is more  likely to concern itself with its own social survival and to ignore the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the preservation of the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health, when he was the spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, went on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development knows, the Government has cut back its expenditure on the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development knows that his Government has not conferred with all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish these young bureaucrats would brief the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  a little better on the development of and the necessity for our creating an Australian Heritage Commission with approximately 18 commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the Commissioners are all good people and I have been advised by people who should know their backgrounds and their disciplines, I understand that most of the Commissioners have disciplines in the man-made <span class="highlight">environment</span> and not so much in the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Last night during the second reading debate I commented on this clause, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  would be aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is downgraded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned growth centres in another context; our plans for urban and regional development embraced in the widest sense a whole range of policies for improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, for improving roads, transport, the supply of land, sewerage and essential community services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  said in his statement of 26 July: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be more opportunity to elaborate on the cutbacks in real terms of funds available to various departments such as Health, Education, <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that more and more the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> of both Sydney and Melbourne will degenerate, particularly under this Government’s new federalism policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot of Australia’s natural resources and <span class="highlight">environment</span> are in danger from overexploitation without proper care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this House would do well to look at its own capacity to examine protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department has grown out of three of the former Administration’s departments: The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the Department of Urban and Regional Development and the recreation wing of the Department of Recreation and Tourism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the Prime Minister in a speech on 2 June made very clear where this Government stands in matters of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the protection of the National Estate and the prospering of urban and regional affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The apportionment of the allocations between the State Housing Authority and the Home Builders’ Account for each State is as determined by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development after consultation with the housing Minister of the State concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within 8 months this conservative Government has virtually destroyed all programs that sought to improve the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> of our major cities and to relieve the pressures on cities by developing regional growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Firemen and Deckhands Union has given constant trouble in its militancy and caused stoppages for reasons as wide ranging as Medibank, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, higher wages, sympathy with the teachers ‘ strike and the refusal to handle French ships, following the French nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The misrepresentation is that during my speech I quoted what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  had said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to apprenticeships, the most recent figures available indicate that in New South Wales alone- I accept that the extent of the crisis in this industry varies from State to State with New South Wales being accepted by all, including the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  as the worst affected- over 1650 apprentices from this industry are now on the dole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has itself recognised that it is unlikely that the rise in private commencements in the June quarter will be maintained on a national level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The visits take place only after all the proper environmental controls have been applied, and my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is principally in charge of those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development been drawn to the claim by the Executive Director of the Master Builders Association, which is supported by the building unions and associated industries, that only by committing an extra $350m can the Australian and New South Wales Governments save the New South Wales building industry from total bankruptcy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will remember that in the document entitled  Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia  tabled on 4 June, it was stated that because the authority for controlling emergency services is vested in State governments, the Commonwealth Government must rely on the States to establish and control the safety organisation in their ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Time may show that the most important contribution of this Budget is the creation of an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is very much more favourable to reasonable reward for reasonable effort in the private sector- an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which was certainly lost in the three years up to December 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By keeping unemployment high, the Government clearly hopes to maintain an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which its policy of reducing real wages will be capable of implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development concerns mermaids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that this industry is undercapitalised, equipped with obsolete plant and lacking in the marketing and management skills to survive in a competitive international <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Either directly or by inference, he said he would increase expenditure on schools, roads, health services, sewerage, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, women and children, Aborigines, the unemployed, public works, construction, shipbuilding, Medibank, State funds, growth centres, pensions, supporting mothers, unemployed school leavers, aged persons homes, destitute and lonely men- that includes most of the Opposition- supporting fathers, migrants, defence, nursing homes, hospitals, school dental services, refuges for women, national highways and last but not least, women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looked at in its right perspective, wage increases are becoming in the present <span class="highlight">environment</span> more and more a device whereby the have groups among the wage and salary earners are protecting their positions at the expense of the have nots, not only among wage and salary earners but also among self-employed groups, particularly those in rural areas who are dependent solely on what the world is prepared to pay them for their products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So let us go back to Launceston, which was the scene of the start of the long march and which is where his favourite Tasmanian- the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)-  comes from and see what the exceedingly conservative  Launceston Examiner  has had to say about this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of the Statistical Information System by the Local Government Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, in co-operation with the Bureau of Statistics, will provide a data bank of information of benefit to researchers and people concerned with local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Prospect and is concerned with the sell-out of the ex-servicemen of this country by the Fraser Government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the intention of the 3 governments, as expressed in the preamble to the Agreement, that ‘a development corporation will, by developing a growth complex, create a city with a high quality <span class="highlight">environment</span>, properly planned and properly developed, having full regard to human requirements and the involvement of the public’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The critical comments made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  cannot be directed just at the former Federal Labor Government; he is obviously taking to task State governments of his own political persuasions which acquiesced in the land acquisition program at AlburyWodonga which he has so trenchantly attacked and criticised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government, through the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development in his position as  Chairman  of the Ministerial Council on the Development of Albury-Wodonga, will encourage private industry to develop and private enterprise generally to be active in the Albury-Wodonga area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in pursuit of a more amenable <span class="highlight">environment</span> which can be provided only by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have helped us to increase our knowledge of the physical and biological <span class="highlight">environment</span> through which we move and on which we depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it is concerned with the maintenance and enhancement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, with the improvement of working conditions, and in contributing to basic scientific knowledge as a necessary background to applied research and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we simply cannot afford to persevere with a policy of ever-increasing assistance to industries which seem to be becoming less economic for the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> It reduces the opportunities for the more economic industries and those which have good prospects of growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the performance of its functions, the Commission shall have regard to the desire of the Australian Government, in pursuing the general objectives of national economic and social policy and urban and regional development, to improve and promote the well-being of the people of Australia, with full employment, stability in the general level of prices, viability in external economic relations, conservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and rising and generally enjoyed standards of living- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the weekend he represented the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  at a seminar which was sponsored by Civic Constructions Pty Ltd. A Press report of his speech states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the serious potential danger of these nets to the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, will the Minister ban their use in Commonwealth waters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I am so keen to have these nets banned is the long term effects they will have on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Government which I fear has an obscurantist approach is having some trouble in seeing the arguments put forward by the fishermenthe people who know about fishing and the people who invariably are great environmentaliststhat these nets militate against the best interests of the fishing industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I assure the House that the facts are that monofilament nets are against the long term and short term interests of the fishing industry in Australia and of our marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leap in public fear, from just over a third of the populace to more than a half, cannot be rationally explained by changes in Australia’s external <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if there is competition, we should work to limit it to peaceful competition in the supply of aid and matters of that kind in a world economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> which provides opportunities for all nations to develop their trade and grow in prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The municipalities of those areas must bear the costs brought about by the heavy flow of through traffic which does not create any revenue or satisfaction but in fact destroys the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the people in those municipalities live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the Liberal Party returned to government he became Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December he became the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the huge and boyish enthusiasm he found for his new and, on the face of it, unlikely portfolio of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He quickly decided that in moving from the area of AttorneyGeneral to <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development he had not, in fact, moved from the sublime to the ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, he loved the unique beauty of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was not merely a Minister performing the duties of his portfolio but also a man with a great love for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the natural beauty of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The advantages are: The conveying of information earlier than other media; the audio-visual potential to convey all aspects of a subject; and its ability to enlarge the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of viewers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  referred in his second reading speech to people who can exercise this option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the second reading speech by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  this is what the Government proposes to do: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently- I think that this was stated in the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)-  86 homes or 1400 handicapped children are covered by this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new income test to determine pension entitlements is a concept attributed, in the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  to Professor Ronald Henderson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This is the first time we have discussed the Estimates of the new Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When it was first amalgamated with the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and also with the recreation section of the previous Department of Tourism and Recreation I thought it was a forward move by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Environmental matters have an interrelationship with urban and regional development because everything is connected to everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Minister who administers it, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  is a junior Minister who is not even a member of the Cabinet and consequently not on the Cabinet Economic Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development are concerned about the area of dwelling and non-dwelling construction in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the future in the areas of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, housing and community development and construction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is more thoughtful and more effective in what he seeks to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The challenges for the future are there in these departments, particularly in the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems that there is a potential to build an area of concern and real achievement around a total way of life, about the home, about the community and about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should be looking at minimum standards of achievement in the areas of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, community development and housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development show how the Fraser Government has downgraded the range of initiatives taken under the Department of Urban and Regional Development by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)not  a bad fellow in many respects- is suffering the indignity of presiding over the Australian Government’s abdication of its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A positive approach by the Government to its obligations could advantage the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, housing and quality of life of present and future Australian generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not matter what one looks at, whether it is essential conservation programs, air quality monitoring programs, soil conservation studies or the Botany Bay environmental project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every one of those Budget estimates associated with the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and the Department of Construction has been the subject of some savage curtailment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak on a matter affecting the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government, through its <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority, has proved unable significantly to abate the nuisance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I recognise the program of monitoring that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is interested in, it is no good having that program unless there is a back-up to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I am afraid the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  is a bit difficult to come to grips with because he spoke in irrelevancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I understand his point of view, but the limits of my responsibilities under the Environmental Protection Act are accurately described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On behalf of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, I bring up the report of the Committee on trafficking in fauna in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the evidence it received the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation could not but be convinced that it was considering a multi-million dollar business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>These matters are very important when we consider that there has been an explosion in relation to the knowledge of the world <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The reference I made to air pollution under the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, leads me to refer to the same matter under these estimates for the Department of Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet despite all this expenditure on monitoring and experimental work, we find that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  is reported as saying at page 1924 of the House of Representatives  Hansard: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in debating the estimates of the Department of Science we should say something about the appalling effect in the community of the gross misrepresentation at the present time, and the guessing about the future effect of nuclear energy on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our country’s foreign policy, if it is to be viable, must take into account the regional <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it is to function and although preserving our position on principle it has not and does not serve Australia ‘s interests to place itself on a massive collision course with its largest regional neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Academy has two basic objectives: To provide a sound education as a foundation for further professional development, and to provide that education in a military <span class="highlight">environment</span> appropriate to the three Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following this I will propose next year legislation to lay down principles of administration that will ensure both its academic autonomy and scholarship, and retention of the required military <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst we look at our appreciation of the future we ought at the same time to look at some of the other problems which are not dealt with by the Department of Defence but which create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> from which come other problems that are vital to the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is this: In response to other questions asked in the House about the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act I have made it very clear that we are not satisfied that the Act is being administered properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand the thrust of the article was that we were passing the buck on <span class="highlight">environment</span>; yet in the middle of the article the writer says that the Government wants to adopt a strong leadership role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development: Is it a fact that the United Nations General Assembly will debate the Habitat Plan for Action next week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In March 1973,  Dr Cass,  Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, and I met in Canberra with the then Premier of New South Wales and the Premiers of Victoria and South Australia to consider reforming the charter of the River Murray Commission, the first time the heads of the 4 participating governments had met in 60 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refute the assertions that are made from time to time that this Government is giving very low priority to matters that affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Appropriations are made for conservation programs involving the National Estate, nature conservation and grants to the voluntary conservation bodies such as the national trusts and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, the Government has made it clear that it accepts a role and responsibility for the conservation of our National Estate, whether it be of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> or of the built <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this debate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  interjected about the problems of those people on 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt if the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  would have done that because I know that on previous occasions the Minister has indicated that there is a great need for additional funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention as an aside that it seems peculiar that in a situation like that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is presiding over a situation where allocations for land commissions have been cut by $28.9m in the Budget that has been debated recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The asset of a home is a hedge against inflation and from an ascetic point of view the home buyer has greater freedom in choosing what he or she requires as a standard of accommodation, location, and in particular, <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  for insisting that in the Agreement with the States the long established interest rates of 4 per cent and   4 1/2  per cent be maintained, although when the original agreement was made interest rates at 4 per cent and   4 1/2  per cent were approximately only 2 per cent below the current long term bond interest rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to offer criticism, but, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development quite rightly stated in his second reading speech on this Bill, the States are able to make money available for welfare housing from their own funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister claims an increase in assistance under this Bill for urban transport demonstrates his Government’s concern for the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the truth of the matter is- I want to make this quite clear to the Parliament- that he is obliged under the public transport Acts of 1974, the 2 Acts I mentioned earlier, to respond to increases in costs of projects approved under the Acts with an increased appropriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will know that last Thursday his Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development issued a statement that the Government ‘will be looking very closely at the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and will be announcing its decisions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EFIC is not in the business of giving more generous credit terms than are necessary in a normal commercial <span class="highlight">environment</span> to gain business but it is not the intention of the Government that interest rates which will prevail under the new arrangements will be any greater than those which prevailed under the old arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This arises, of course, out of the feeling of the citizens of Nauru that justice would be seen to be done if cases were dealt with by 2 persons independent of the rather limited <span class="highlight">environment</span> and atmosphere of the island of Nauru which has been delineated by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission has expressed a view that the objectives and working of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act may not be clearly understood in some Government departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Normally, expenditure of Commonwealth funds would require the preparation by the States of environmental impact statements on the proposed plantings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the very beginning of that meeting I was presented with 2 documents from FIDO which contained a number of what can best be described as misleading, at the worst untruthful, statements on the attitude of the Fraser Government to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in general and Fraser Island in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing  and Community Development Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T.,2600 16 August 1976 <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon after his visit,  Senator Greenwood  fell ill and during his illness there have been two acting Ministers for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>- making a total of four since Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister- (compare this with the four <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Ministers during the last six months of the Whitlam Government). ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I made at the meeting was that the Senator’s illness, and subsequent replacement, was something that no reasonable person could interpret as showing any lack of concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> on the part of the Government, and was something that could not be compared with the fact that the previous Government had four <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Ministers in its last six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman spoke of the need for jobs as being a part of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which people must live and of the need for security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> certainly does need preservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many parts of the world it has been polluted and destroyed because people have not looked with sufficient concern at the damage that members of the human species can do if they are allowed to run wild in certain parts of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is not represented on this Committee and is not being consulted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may rest assured that the Government will take very close note of what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, advised by his Department, says in relation to all matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as obviously this report does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we should also be looking at the opportunity cost of undertaking increased defence expenditure at the expense of other public programs such as education or health or programs for a better <span class="highlight">environment</span>, better roads, better harbours or better railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He might have added that every other specific purpose project- funds for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the national estate, area improvement programs, regional employment schemes- will now have to come from general purpose revenue as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third Minister is none other than the Minister at the table, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-If we believed that the Fraser Government had a genuine commitment to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> the Labor Party would applaud the amendment proposed by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government amends this Act in what could be a meaningful way it has, by its actions in the related areas that measure a government’s commitment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, shown a lack of awareness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  went to great pains in his second reading speech to demonstrate his Government’s commitment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is under attack because of this Government’s desire for uncontrolled growth- growth in migration, growth in mining, growth in woodchip and wood pulping, and growth in the lack of awareness of people who little understand the delicate nature and fabric of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This report confirmed that the Whitlam Labor Government was the first government to make a genuine commitment to the charting of the National Estate and conserving our <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the Australians of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had a mandate to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We enacted complementary and supplementary pieces of legislation and we appropriated funds all to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The highlight of our environmental legislation was the Australian Heritage Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It supplemented the working of other Acts of the Labor Government including the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the Great Barrier <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike this Government we gave a high priority to the matters that affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the claims of this Government to the contrary, nobody believes that it is genuinely committed to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government asked us all to believe that it is giving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> a high priority because it has made appointments to the Australian Heritage Commission, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people know that no action has been taken to protect the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has taken no action to introduce the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Marine) Bill drawn up by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is just one more example of its lack of environmental commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is further seen in the Government’s stated intention to give the States the administration of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) legislation, its lack of commitment to the built <span class="highlight">environment</span>, its refusal to fund nature conservation organisations on a non-matching grants basis if funded at all and its abolition of the public <span class="highlight">environment</span> awareness program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s lack of commitment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation has been highlighted in several ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only was this decision a clear breach of the legislation, but also it shows a complete disregard that powerful elements of the current Government have for environmental considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the best measure of the Government’s commitment is the future of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has stated in this House that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) legislation is under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In saying this, the Government is ignoring the fact that no State government in Australia has adequate legislation designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State governments, unlike the Federal Government, have a basic conflict in regard to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, I am referring here to the conflict which the States, particularly the less populous States, have in regard to development and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland there are only 6 people employed in the Co-ordinator General’s Department with the responsibility under the State administrative arrangements to look at environmental questions arising from the development proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people never get the chance to comment upon mining proposals because the Queensland Government feels that the environmental issues concerned can be looked after properly in Mining Warden’s Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Officials of this court are not qualified to consider environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expertise of multi-disciplinary teams available to the Federal Government puts it in a much better situation than the States to conduct an impartial inquiry into the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Australian Government does not face the basic conflict that the’ State governments face on the issues of development as opposed to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further illustration of this Government’s lack of commitment to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> concerns the nature of their grants to conservation organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were used for research and technical, administrative and information functions provided by various environmental action groups of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government provided these grants in recognition of and support for the valuable work being done by the community action groups in defence of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government believed that the protection and improvement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> were issues which directly affected everyday life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action was considered appropriate by Labor because the Australian Government is prevented from acting on many aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by constitutional limitations and by the reluctance and in some cases the refusal of our State counterparts to co-operate with us in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By making grants of this nature, the Labor Government sought to establish a permanent and growing network of action and information groups capable of influencing governmental and commercial impacts on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We considered community participation in environmental decisions as essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regarded the grants as pioneering grants or seed money given to help the growth of community concern and activity for the protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would never have forced environmental centres to close as this Government will force the environmental centres of certain areas to close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not encouraging people’s participation in this delicate area of our people ‘s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An area of particular concern to me is the lack of this Government’s commitment to the protection and enhancement of the built <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen this Government break down the programs introduced by the Labor Government which were intended to improve the quality of life and enhance the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in our urban centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a broad view of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We knew that to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, related and complementary programs were needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All our urban and regional development programs complemented our environmental programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be used to ease the strain on existing infrastructure services and to improve the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, both built and natural. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was our intention to use this program to set aside large areas of the Dandenongs in Victoria and the Blue Mountains escarpment in New South Wales for the recreational and environmental purposes of our urban dwellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duplicity of this Government’s conduct of a public relations exercise, emphasising its commitment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is further shown by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government had a genuine commitment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, this amendment would be commendable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government, by introducing this amendment, is paying only lip service to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government shows it is prepared to take real action to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and when it shows a genuine concern, it may be possible to reach a bipartisan approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  is well able to defend himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was interesting to note in the Second Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation into <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to offer praise also to the dedication of the officers of the national parks and wildlife services that I have met in the various States as a result of my association first as a member and then as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it quite clear that this Government is committed to a program of protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is genuine in its approach towards the protection of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and towards the uplifting of our built or social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognises the needs for, and the Minister has stated and restated that the Government will uphold the principles of, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These bodies enjoy an important place in the operation of this Government and, more particularly, in the Ministry of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Minister that I for one am most appreciative of the service and the attention he has given to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also a full Committee inquiry dealing with the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to dispel the thoughts of the pessimists, particularly those on the Opposition benches, and to assure Australians that this Government is deeply committed to the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the conservation of Australia’s flora and fauna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I commend to the House and the nation the leaflets that have just been produced by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 bodies concerned insofar as this report on trafficking in fauna in Australia is concerned- the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that if we were able to count up the countless thousands of hectares that have been cleared for farming- that is, the complete destruction of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>- and to add to that the countless thousands of hectares of partly cleared land that is used for grazing purposes and were to compare that land with the area that has been despoiled by the mining companies we would all be in for a shock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  stated in his second reading speech, in 1974 the Parliament legislated to make it possible for the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to the States for purposes connected with nature conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past decade, debate and concern about environmental and conservation matters have been widespread, particularly as they relate to our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns me, however, is that not all groups supposedly interested in promoting conservation and environmental issues do so with balance or honesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a natural tendency at our stage of developmenta transition from pioneering in both the agricultural and industrial stages into rationalisation and stabilisation- that issues of conservation and protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> become prominent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the next few months this Parliament will be making important decisions closely tied to environmental issues and the preservation of our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament will be charged with protecting many areas of unique environmental significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the hardy race of people who live and work in the harsh <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Pilbara area of Western Australia and who put up with the heat, the dust, the flies and the loneliness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government’s position in relation to this matter will be made known later this afternoon or this evening by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On more than one occasion I have referred to the difficulty involved in coming to a decision about this matter because there are legitimate interests in the conservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- The Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry reported its final findings and recommendations to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on 2 1 October 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry, which was conducted under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 for the purposes of achieving the object of the Act recommended that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a decision both in keeping with the Government’s policy concerning the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as well as being part of our international obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will consult with the Queensland Government seeking joint Commonwealth-State action to develop an agreed management plan for Fraser Island, having in mind the preservation of the Island ‘s natural features and the oversight of Island activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Fraser Island is of great significance, complexity and fragility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the inevitable highlighting of the presence and importance of these individual features of its natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> should not be allowed to obscure the links and interdependency of its many fragile elements, while, overall, an impression of wilderness gives unity to the broad spectrum of the particular natural features of the Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly a great victory for all concerned with the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first set of costs will be borne by the nation as a whole, and this is appropriate as we are seeking to preserve a unique aspect of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After listening to the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  I do not feel much satisfaction about the protection that is being offered to persons who are directly affected by the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must make comment upon the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be of real assistance in employing the men who are hurt by necessary, progressive decisions taken by the Government of honourable members opposite, decisions which we applaud for environmental reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Today the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community Development  (Mr Newman)  announced the decision of the Federal Government on the report of the Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One acknowledges immediately the Government’s need to maintain its credibility as a government that is sensitive to its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a suggestion and argument and counter-argument that opinions polarise to those who are enlightened and sensitive souls and those who derive some practical and material benefit from sand mining on Fraser Island and who therefore are obtuse and insensitive to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would suggest to this House that one must accept the possibility that the members of the Commission, having an expertise arising from their long association with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, associated in turn with their professions, must have subconsciously at least an inclination or a predisposition to maintain the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people may reasonably have expected some security of tenure in their new <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What assurances are to be given to the Maryborough area, indeed to Queensland as a whole, that there will not be another intrusion on the wellbeing of the district as a result of increased ambition by those who have a disproportionate and unqualified commitment to preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> regardless of other considerations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has applied the environmental protection impact study retrospectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We delude ourselves if we say that we can maintain the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of certain sections of this country when we live under the threat of a total breakdown of our economic and social structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does any honourable member seriously suggest that individuals in one State or another are less sensitive to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or are of a lower intellectual standing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What nonsense it is to suggest that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Queensland must be protected by the overlording role of the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span>, the continual criticisms and charges by the then Opposition, the present Government, that I was doing nothing to save Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, having established, in accordance with the environmental protection legislation, a committee of inquiry, we were prepared to await results of that inquiry and then be guided by the findings of fact of the inquiry in order to determine what our future policy should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole concept of the environmental impact statement procedure envisages that people’s rights come first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not just the right to earn a living; it is the right to enjoy the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to appreciate things of aesthetic beauty, and to be whatever it is that makes us humans and not animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental inquiry should be concerned with the total <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to consider whether it is concerned with the total <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total <span class="highlight">environment</span> consists not only of people being able to walk around sand dunes with trees on them but also of people having decent living standards within their own households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me read, first of all, the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ which activated the minds of the commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the first page of the report it is stated that the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- …. includes all aspects of the surroundings of man, whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groupings, and ‘environmental’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that in its definition of ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’, the report has completely ignored anything to do with the household <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the people concerned directly and indirectly in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a totally inadequate report because it has denned ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ in a certain way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes we forget that in this world the <span class="highlight">environment</span> exists for man and man does not exist to serve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report deals with the regional economic effects, which are concerned with the most intimate <span class="highlight">environment</span> of all, on pages 1 73 to 1 75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission of Inquiry was appointed on 12 July 1975 in pursuance of section 1 1 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 to conduct an inquiry known as the Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry: … in respect of all of the environmental aspects of the making of decisions by or on behalf of the Australian (Commonwealth) Government in relation to the exportation from Australia of minerals (including minerals that have been subjected to processing or treatment) extracted or which may hereafter be extracted from Fraser Island in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it must be recognised that this is not a decision just affecting the people in the Wide Bay area; it is not a decision just for environmentalists; it is a decision affecting the whole of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the proposals put forward by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  concerning the workers and the region are not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that Australians who are concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and who have fought so hard to protect Fraser Island from the bulldozer mentality have at last had a major victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither myself nor the Labor Party ever wants to see destruction to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> similar to that which occurred with Lake Pedder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I find this decision commendable, I believe it is contrary to this Government’s attitude to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past year the Government has given no indication at all of any understandings of environmental issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has cut back drastically on all major environmental commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I hope there will be a financial commitment to this side environmental issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally the Government’s attitude to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is contradictory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a short term economic purpose the Government reduced the amount appropriated for protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It worries me that this is just a sop to the environmental groups and concerned Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government may not have the same commitment to the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry chaired by  Mr Justice  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not criticise the decision on Fraser Island- in fact I have said very clearly that I applaud it- from an environmental protection point of view I am worried by the way the Government intends to protect the displaced workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is only marginally less important when a government decides to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that it should take definite action to protect the people in the area concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Covernment cannot make a decision in relation to one inquiry commenced under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and then ignore the report of another environmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report obviously pre-supposes that Fraser Island is the exclusive preserve of environmentalists and scientists, with lesser beings perhaps permitted, provided they do not disturb the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sandmining is obviously a dirty word to environmentalists, with timber harvesting only faring slightly better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The working party consisted of representatives of the Insurance Commissioner, the Australian Government Actuary, and the Departments of the Treasury, the Prime Minister and Cabinet, <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, and Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and relates to AlburyWodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confirm that the final report of the Commission of Inquiry on Fraser Island is primarily concerned with the environmental aspects of Commonwealth decisions regarding the export of minerals extracted from the island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this event, will the Government also examine the impact of forestry and tourism on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Fraser Island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are disadvantaged not only in the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the schools but also in their home <span class="highlight">environment</span>, with all things that go with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was he who submitted in evidence to the Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties that the influence on educational under-achievement of other factors such as cultural and linguistic difficulties, basic housing and health problems in a domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the pattern of alcohol consumption and problems of frequent family movement should be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes into the schools seeking to discover what is missing in the link between the education situation and the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> one need only speak to community relations officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However it must also be borne in mind that when people are brought into a completely new <span class="highlight">environment</span> there needs to be special consideration so far as housing is concerned if they are to fit adequately into a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned about the economic and environmental consequences of the continuation of agreements like this and we are concerned that the studies undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Forestry and Timber Bureau are not public and may have overlooked many important issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There must be a commission of inquiry established under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act to review the entire forestry industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 23 July 1 974 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation resolved to inquire and report upon: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stringent conditions should be imposed upon the lending of Federal money to ensure that forestry management procedures designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are strictly observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recognition of some of the issues raised by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the Government has asked the States, and apparently the States have agreed, that new plantings under this agreement will, in the main, be established on land which has already been cleared for agricultural purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to waive the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) legislation for monies expended under this agreement causes this side of the House concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that an environmental impact statement should be called for from the States before they are allowed to clear fell native forest areas for the planting of softwood forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough for the Government to announce that if future agreements of this nature are made, it will be necessary for the States to comply with the administrative arrangements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that enough is understood about the delicate nature and fabric of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the conflict that arises between development proposals and the need to preserve our heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a duty to ensure that clear-felling of parts of our native forests is rationalised and that enough areas of native forest are left to preserve our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with our own natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the more we study our <span class="highlight">environment</span> the more we understand it, whether it be in our gardens, whether it be in our forests or whether it be the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-This is the second occasion this week on which I have followed the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  in a debate on <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition stands there in a pious and authoritative way telling this nation that the Government knows nothing and cares nothing for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned, firstly, with the environmental aspects of this Bill and, secondly, with the fact that it is providing employment that is so needed today in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I am interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I am not a rabid environmentalist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I hope that I can present a fairly balanced view on matters concerning the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer, as did the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the rather sterile <span class="highlight">environment</span> that results from the planting of many species of softwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of people may refute this but I think the findings of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee clearly illustrate that a sterile <span class="highlight">environment</span> is produced by the planting of many of these trees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I restate that environmental impact studies and statements should be produced by the States for the various areas that they wish to plant with softwood forests in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  shows a deep concern for environmental issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refute the statement that is freque’ntly made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that this Government is not interested in this area of the’ <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I state again that the Government is firmly committed to the protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has referred a number of factors contained in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the softwood forestry agreements for examination by bodies which previously had a preconceived view of the matter in that they had prepared material for the Forwood Conference and, indeed, had given evidence before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some stage we have to consider what we do about the total timber industry- the total forestry industry- for economic and resource reasons in addition to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation aspects that have been mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which dealt with the reference on the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We examined not only the principles being used in the growth, actual farming and harvesting of the crops but also what measures were taken to ensure protection for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the natural flora and fauna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for caution because of the involved nature of forestry, and because of the difficulty in divorcing from a consideration of softwood forests consideration of hardwood forests, the preservation of native forest and many natural features of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, this does not relieve any of us of the responsibility to improve the conditions and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which Aboriginal people live because these factors undoubtedly do contribute to the health of the people of Central Australia and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development issue copies of his speeches to the Opposition 2 hours prior to presenting them in this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister tell the House how a speaker at the demonstration had a copy of his statement on the Ranger uranium environmental study approximately  VA  hours prior to its being delivered in this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will know that last Thursday the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development stated that the Government welcomes any international initiatives for strengthening the international nonproliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  made that amended statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were implications- deliberately, it seemed to me- in the reply by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development at question time this afternoon that members of the Opposition had given people outside the House copies of a proposed ministerial statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have noticed that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  stated quite properly at what time he handed the statement to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A brief history of the previous Acts is given in the 1975 report of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is the submerged area directly affected but also the whole ecosystem downstream, the habitat of fish and other wildlife, the farming and townspeople who depend on the water flow from the river; in other words, the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> downstream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to protect this country from the speculator, the exploiter, or those people bent on the destruction of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> we must adopt and act in accordance with a land use and water resources policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most significant environmental studies undertaken to date, and continuing, relates to the waters of Westernport Bay and the catchment area, including groundwater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from the Draft <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Policy: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy will become binding on all sections of the community-industry, trade, commerce, householders and Government Departments and agencies, including the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy was developed from the 1973-74 Westernport Bay <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Study- the socalled Shapiro report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point I emphasise is that this was an environmental study under a conservation ministry laying down a policy which will allow development of resources without damage to a sensitive and significant coastal and water <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Draft <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Policy on the Waters of Westernport Bay and Catchment recommends that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority in Victoria:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before works could commence the Government required an environmental study to be presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investigations, public meetings, written submissions, and a study of the implications of the works on the natural and social <span class="highlight">environment</span> during the phases of construction, inundation and operation have been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, the investigators found that no major environmental defects would result from the proposed works, although the exclusion of the public from parts of the catchment area of the Thomson Dam is causing concern to a large number of people and to local government authorities in the Latrobe Valley area of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want work, a good <span class="highlight">environment</span> with the sort of community facilities modern urban living should provide and the right to earn and pay our way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Resources are to be diverted away from high-cost industries towards industries that are more efficient in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is needed is a more positive approach with practical recommendations for a more efficient use of resources in a competitive world <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Premier of Victoria is one who certainly has been in the vanguard of protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; his record stands as second to none in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain that the Premier of Victoria would not pursue an activity or a State enterprise such as the construction of a power station if it were contrary to the broader interests of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the honourable member for Lalor would be well aware that the deadlock over this power station is not just a matter of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  who is at the table came to this Parliament as a result of undertakings of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week the Minister for <span class="highlight">environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who is at the table, announced certain proposals relating to Fraser Island, proposals which were supported by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Before I call the honourable member for Corio, I want to make one comment in regard to what was said by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  started his speech by saying that he would not have won his seat in Parliament if it had not been for the policies of the previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to the rather pathetic bleatings in the Press statement of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition issued on 7 November following the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  on growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that many other Australians are starting to feel much the same way about their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation here is that we ought not to produce in legislation, particularly adventurous legislation attempting to create a new social <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the Aboriginal people, trappings which we do not have in other legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These provisions authorise directors to have regard to the interests of employees, the effects of the company’s activities on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the interests of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to find out where we are going, what it is all about and what is the new defence <span class="highlight">environment</span> and foreign policy <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can take our time about the kind of equipment that we need in this <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have to look more emphatically at our own immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at our <span class="highlight">environment</span> within 3000 miles of Australia, we see no country with aircraft which would be able to take on even the Mirage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a grave inconsistency here because the White Paper points out the new defence <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live and says that we have to be more independent, less dependent on the United States and we have to organise ourselves for more joint force operations; but there is no reassessment of how we should do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister, in an address to the Stanford Research Institute on 15 November, stated that external policy was being used ‘to create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where businesses can plan ahead ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 28 October, the day it was issued, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  made a Press statement in which he singled out for emphasis only two of those findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Justice Fox and the two commissioners from the Ranger environmental inquiry have attacked the Government over its interpretaton of the Fox Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a recent letter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  the Fox commissioners have claimed their first two findings do not amount to recommendations . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not subscribe to the view being put by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that the Ranger inquiry itself constitutes a full examination by the people of the uranium and nuclear industry issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, this debate encompasses the contents of two documents, the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and the Ministerial statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  in respect to the supply of Australian uranium under existing international contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry or the Fox Report, as it is known, is a document of international significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously from statements of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development at the time of the delivery of the Fox report and on the occasion of the statement in the House of Representatives pertaining to existing contracts, the Government does not take the Fox Commission’s warnings seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the Task Force’s advertisement did not specifically seek submissions from amateur and professional sporting organisations, the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development did, I am advised, draw the Task Force’s advertisement for submissions to the attention of national sporting organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- the pollution of an already polluted atmosphere-is an issue in the struggle against the Newport proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To allow these increases, plus that from Newport, to be added to an already bad situation seems to indicate that the official goal of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and the Government that is to clean up Melbourne’s air pollution is not being taken seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their motivation principally has been one of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but there are also other issues, as the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  mentioned, such as town planning and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognised that housing policy was an integral part of our policies concerned with the quality of both the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the built <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and in particular the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, who is at the table, do not appear to understand the importance of financial and monetary management to housing policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an indication of the priority that this Government gives to the important issue of housing, not to mention the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and community living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was followed in government by a statement by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the late  Senator Ivor  Greenwood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is thoughtful and sympathetic, and I know that it will be very well adminstered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development who is at the table and by his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who is responsible for these matters, is showing an interest in what I am saying, because the same kind of problem could occur again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, who has come out of a very protected life in the socialised service of the Army, would probably know that there are lots of people around who lack the capacity to save $40 or $48 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Country Party believes that the introduction of this Bill by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  is very appropriate and continues the great work of the late  Senator Ivor  Greenwood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So when it is said in this House for environmental or other reasons that mining needs to be looked at suspiciously in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and needs to be curbed in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>- that is the background of many of the statements- that is a grossly incorrect proposition to put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions on social problems concentrated on the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the control or elimination of pollution and the need for international co-operation in these matters; the growth in population, unemployment and urban poverty and a pressing need in some of the less developed countries to arrest or even reverse the drift to the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The issue of rural adjustment assistance and the role it is to play in future agricultural policy in Australia must be viewed against the significant changes which have occurred in its structure of the rural sector since the war, and the sector’s ability in a social and economic sense to respond autonomously to changes in its economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns us on this side of the House that the Government has not tabled the annual report of the Corporation, which demonstrates these inequities, even though the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who had the responsibility for the Corporation, has had the report for at least 4 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than attacking the Labor Premiers who have these and other doubts over the end result of the Fraser Government’s proposal, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development would be more productive if he ensured that studies were undertaken correlating the cost benefit and social welfare implications of alternatives to the existing scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He took a letter, which was written by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to State Premiers, as the basis of discussion for a new agreement, out of context and has attempted, for blatant political purposes connected with the Western Australian election, to totally misrepresent the Commonwealth Government’s position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, the Government has noted the report and has taken a decision to establish an office of youth affairs within the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to investigate further the question of a youth advisory council or panel and report to it after the Office has been operating  some  6 or 1 2 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the honourable member to pages 26-27 in my Department’s submission to the Inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> into the Impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> of the current Woodship Industry program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-55">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, August 1973 was the time when it became quite clear that Government policies would lead us into an economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> within which the private sector would have great difficulty in sustaining the high level of production, the high level of prosperity, that we had come to accept as the norm in Australia, particularly in the decade prior to 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see opposite my old friend the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who is well known in this Parliament as the ‘undertaker of social reforms’ because on his own initiative he has jettisoned about twelve or fifteen major programs which were initiated by the Labor Minister for Urban and Regional Development, by myself and by other Ministers of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of this dilemma- this incapacity to pay- which provides a distressing situation for very many families, the bright idea of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is that the Government is going to introduce this housing voucher scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the hide, the temerity and the audacity to criticise the most imaginative Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development ever to come from Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  needs no defence at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During question time the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development indicated that adequate copies of the Fox report were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the House  (Mr Sinclair)  will be aware, and honourable members are obviously aware, of the concern being expressed by the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation that issues relating to the sittings of the House contained in that report have not come before the House for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As soon as there is any pressure on the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  he caves in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an article in a recent issue of ‘Environs’, a publication of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, Professor F. H. Talbot, the Director of the Environmental Studies Program at Macquarie University comments on the report of the Commission on Inquiry into Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Talbot’s article implies that future logging on the island may destroy its natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have an <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a lifestyle attractive to many people from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These and many other initiatives have made a substantial further contribution to easing the inevitable difficulties of adjustment to a new <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a new culture and, for many, a new language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suggest to the knockers and the critics that they get out to see what these developments are really giving Australia in export earnings, tax revenue and job opportunities, while being very careful in their responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Stagnation, in terms either of economic growth or her own personal development, is not the stuff of which higher living standards can be made and it is not the stuff of which a country can possess itself if it hopes to improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for each one of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question has been posed whether we should be encouraging people to come to a consumer culture, such as we have in Australia, thus placing a greater load on world and local resources and on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article refers to the need for a spirit of partnership in the community between the new arrivals and those of us already here- the older Australians who have had the responsibility of making such an <span class="highlight">environment</span> as we have- to be as helpful as we can to the new migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To take one example, there is no simple relationship between population growth and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It might be thought that a stationary population level would preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and maintain living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible for population movement to be just as great a threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and living quality as a population which increases rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that population movement out of Sydney and Melbourne can bring benefits to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- for example, by reduction of the pressure on the inner city freeways and also by the reduction of the enormous pressure on the sewerage services of those cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand it is argued by many that if population increases the extra income could be used to protect and restore the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government action and legislation could be used to reduce the risks of environmental damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Energy consumers should be given options of supply based on a combination of factors, such as the life of the resource, security of supply, pollution of the local <span class="highlight">environment</span> as well as simple delivered costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourth, women, like everyone else, want some reasonable prospects of security and companionship; a decent <span class="highlight">environment</span>; surroundings and services that are at least modestly convenient, congenial and attractive; reasonable access to libraries, theatres, parks, playgrounds and transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, I present a report of the Committee entitled, ‘Off-Road Vehicles- Impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation the Committee attempted to examine the extent of environmental problems caused by off-road vehicle use around Australia and to look at existing mechanisms employed by government to control the use of these vehicles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee examined the impact of these vehicles on the physical as well as the social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two basic legislative approaches to controlling the use of ORVs and limiting their impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are currently in use in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On balance it seemed to the Committee that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a whole can best be protected by banning the use of vehicles off-road except for specified uses and/or in specific areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combined with the legislative approach the Committee considers it vital that ORV owners be educated to understand the damage they can cause to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the need for restrictions on their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee urges manufacturers and advertising agencies to accept an obligation not to encourage irresponsible use of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day the first Fox report was issued, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  made a Press statement in which he ignored all the inquiry’s findings on the risks of inadequate safeguards and the dangers of nuclear war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development was not even represented on the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox was moved to protest at the misrepresentation by the Government, both in a call which he sought on the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and in a letter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development which has never been published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, Australia must take urgent steps at home and in cooperation with other countries- to develop waste control and disposal techniques to ensure that the world ‘s human population and <span class="highlight">environment</span> will not be exposed to the hideous dangers inherent in nuclear waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that  Sir Brian  Flowers, the former  Chairman  of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution which published in September 1976 its report on nuclear power and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, has publicly lamented the lack of rational debate on nuclear power in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr NEWMAN (Bass-Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development)- With your indulgence,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I think I should answer that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The only thing that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  has done in a public debate in this Parliament has been to re-introduce on the Notice Paper the uranium debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development issued a Press statement which deliberately encouraged this interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 11 November 1976 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who has just spoken in this debate, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> must be protected to the greatest practicable extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly we should consider the implications for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of a decision to go ahead with mining- of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how the Government tries to squirm out of it the issue is this: After the Fox inquiry presented its first report the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  made a short statement and there was a 2-hour debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 11 November the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> made a statement about existing contracts, that is, contracts signed by the McMahon Government before 1972, and debate on that statement was to take place within a week of its having been presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who is carrying the can for the Government on this issue, and a back bencher- the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Cotter)-  have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> says he is keeping records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the time that this debate was initiated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  the Government has adopted a steady and evenhanded approach to the debate and to the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government realises that there are environmental factors and that safeguards regarding health and pollution must be given great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  when he said that the debate has been continuing, deplorable though the state of the debate may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every occasion that I have appeared on a platform- I have been on them with distinguished scientists who have spoken in favour of mining uranium- I simply say: ‘Do you have an answer to that section of the Fox report which says that there is at present no generally accepted means by which high level wastes can be permanently isolated from the <span class="highlight">environment</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the House take note of the ministerial statement relating to uranium exports made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on 1 1 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a small point of a technical nature let me say that during that debate the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  made the assertion that the only thing that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has done in a public debate in this Parliament has been to reintroduce on the notice paper the uranium debate, that it has been put back on the notice paper only because of the matter of public importance submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that it is a panic response by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to the Opposition’s matter of public importance last Tuesday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can be even more grateful to those people who had the courage to pick themselves up and to be transported 10 000 or 12 000 miles across the world to a totally strange <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Particularly in the family-reunion category, a lot of dependent parents come to Australia and for quite understandable reasons find it beyond them to learn the English language at that stage of their life, especially given the fact that they live within a small family <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments at all levels, professional planners and sociologists all are aware of the impact on our <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the movement of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the professional planners within the Bureau of Transport Economics and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development are well aware of the consequences which flow from the complexity of our present urban society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, we are to ask the Bureau of Transport Economics to play its part in planning or advising on the future shape of our urban society it must have available to it all the relevant expertise which is necessary to create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which will allow the majority of citizens to fulfill their ambitions as members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been considered that maintaining a mimimum acceptable <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the big cities of the advanced Western nations, including Australia, in the last third of the 20th century is an awesome challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Urban design and <span class="highlight">environment</span> are the means of reconciling city and car and reorienting public transit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally significantly, transportation can help to create the urban designs and environmental changes necessary to make the transport system work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we opt for unplanned cities and unbridled use of cars, the traffic jam will be absolute and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> intolerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since almost 70 per cent of Australians already live in established cities, it is important to recognise that a primary task for transportation policy is to help in the redevelopment and reconditioning of the existing <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the parts of the city most readily subject to public efforts to change the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 3 1 March 1 977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-88">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the administrative procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act, EISs released for public comment are termed Draft Statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-88">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason public comments often add greater depth and understanding to the environmental assessment of a project made by the proponent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-88">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act recognise that revisions may need to be made to the Draft EIS by the proponent in the light of comments raised during public examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-88">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development the other day, no action will be taken to withdraw the Tasman Limited without a proper examination of what effect such a withdrawal would have on Tasmania and the tourist industry in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They knew that basic and needed programs for health care, hospitals, education, housing, the cities, recreation, transport, sewerage, child care, sport, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> would all suffer from the Fraser federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without Federal intervention there would be no unbroken rail guages between the States; urban transport, particularly the railways, would still be burdened with antiquated equipment and rolling stock; young people would still have inadequate and unequal opportunities for secondary and tertiary education; and new initiatives in health centres, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and child care would not have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country parties view as the main objective of government the creation of a society and an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which individuals may best fulfil themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that has been made possible by another Labor Government contrivance, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriate place to locate the new Bureau, to my mind, would be within the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I read the present organisational structure of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Bureau has been absorbed totally into the Department and there is no trace of its old independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I believe that it is important that the present counterpart of the old Department of Urban and Regional Development- the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development- should be given greater muscle in this administration and that the Bureau of Roads should be made a statutory authority under the Ministry of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Department has an overall environmental approach rather than just the narrow sectional interest of public transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proper solution is to merge the 2 bureaus into a single statutory authority and, in my view, to place that under the administration of the Ministry and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, that is why the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, so far as this Government is concerned, has a very low priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The Review should address itself to an examination of the objectives and functions of the CES (including its role vis a vis unemployment benefit) in the light of the significantly changed <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it now has to operate and the current and prospective demands for its services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-One finds it curious that this motion should appear in the name of the Acting Minister for National Resources  (Mr Nixon)  when previously the Government had nominated the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  as the Minister responsible for the management of the uranium debate within the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development had responsibility in terms of this debate because the Ranger Environmental Inquiry was established by a Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Commission was bound to report to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be established that it will never be used in the production of plutonium and its waste products will be stored in ways which offer no danger to life and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I welcome the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  as it has given us yet another opportunity to debate whether or not our uranium resources should be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who is sitting at the table, fall into this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They want to move in as quickly as possible and exploit Australia’s uranium resources purely and simply from the motive of profit, despite uranium’s potential as a pollutant, as a killer, as a danger to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to the lives and future well being of human beings, born and unborn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development dashed into the media as soon as the Fox report was released with a statement that the report had given the green light to the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to answer that point some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who is at the table, when speaking on 1 1 November last in respect of approved sales of uranium said that the handling and disposal of radioactive waste resulting from nuclear power generation lies with the countries concerned, that is, the countries to which Australia exports uranium for electric power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  made clear that this is an interim measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the coming Budget I hope that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will be striving for a greater allocation of funds for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  for a temperate and considered proposition that he has put to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister sitting at the table- the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development- is sometimes referred to in this Parliament as the undertaker of things, especially those things associated with housing, since he, more than any other Minister, is involved with this process of devolution, process of jettisoning initiatives taken by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Hughes claim that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  had a puzzled look on his face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As one who has been genuinely committed to the welfare of pensioners and the under-privileged since I first came into Parliament 1 1 years ago, may I say that I support the legislation and I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  on the manner in which he is performing the duties of his portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it tended to become a mutual admiration society between the honourable member and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  who is sitting at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he placed undue emphasis on reading into the excellent second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  meanings which one certainly could not possibly apply, even with a most imaginative approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pertinent to remark that the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has achieved more positively, in a short period of time, than other Ministers for Housing have achieved in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it has been a most desirable initiative by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to grant an extension of 12 months, plus $10m, plus greater State freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  was sitting at the table, and it was plain to see that he was very uncomfortable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any suggestion to deter this spoiling of our Reef and fishing grounds must bear in mind the ultimate cost to our <span class="highlight">environment</span> now and in the future, the threat of disease in our livestock industries and the eventual cost to the taxpayer if these intrustions are not stopped now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When doing an investigation with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation just recently, one was led to reflect on the extent of the coastline of Australia and the type of naval craft that were best suited to our purposes, being a large continent with a large coastline and a small population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this very significant matter ought to be drawn to the attention of the House because the implications of this report on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on the future of the Macarthur Growth Centre as seen by observers, according to the newspaper, are tremendously frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only 5 months ago that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  said in a statement that the Government welcomes any international initiatives for strengthening the international non-proliferation regime, implying that the Government itself was not going to devote its attention to the development of safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy intention of the Government- I believe that policy intention has been effectively translated into the legislation- is very clear and that is to treat in an even-handed fashion the commercial operations and the behaviour of sections of the community in a commercial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If competition legislation is regarded- as this Government regards it- as being something quite important and fundamental, then the community ought to be prepared to accept the same restraints as a government where it is operating in a commercial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question, to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development relates to the AlburyWodonga development area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development would be able to deal with that matter better than I could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Projects such as the destruction of pests and afforestation to improve the physical and social <span class="highlight">environment</span> will also be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having raised this matter briefly for the attention of honourable members I should like to suggest that it might be appropriate if this matter were transferred to the authority of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development rather than have it remain with the Department of Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we would be better served by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development handling this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other thing I should like to say, because I think that the record should be clear here, is that this Government has a good record in its concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the Inspectorate, being under the control of the Minister, is under the control of the person who is very much concerned with the industrial relations <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government is really concerned with the industrial relations <span class="highlight">environment</span>, sticking by its word and providing that the Bureau has the same powers, no more or less, and abides by the same procedures and processes it will amend the Act so that the Bureau is subject to ministerial control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is really concerned with the industrial relations <span class="highlight">environment</span> and wishes to avoid confrontation he will have to amend the Bill before it passes so that the Bureau is subject to ministerial control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the we should look first at the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which this legislation was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appeared that that provision was aimed at strikes and bans which had a social or political aim, such as protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, protesting about the Medibank rearrangement, a particular war or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague the Minister for Housing, <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Community Development is well equipped to handle any inquiry on the housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last week in this Parliament I asked a question of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The Review should address itself to an examination of the objectives and functions of the CES (including its role vis a vis unemployment benefit) in the light of the significantly changed <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it now nas to operate and the current and prospective demands for its services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because dairying was carried out in a conducive <span class="highlight">environment</span>, farmers were able to produce a high class commodity at a low cost of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  has to contend with the same Treasury as we had when we were in government and that the Minister will have the problem of fighting its efforts to force up the interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  covered this subject fairly well in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, those resources are considerable, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  knows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time is of the essence and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  seems anxious to answer the questions that have been put to him; so, I shall not delay the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 5 May 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-56-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Task Force established within my Department is chaired by the Director of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> who is assisted by the Deputy Secretary (<span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection) and other officers with relevant expertise and experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-56-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that those people who are advocating free trade should put their money where their mouths are and advocate publicly in this place and in their electorates that we should reduce the amount of money being paid to Australian workers and increase the amount of time that people are actually working, and we will see how long they survive in that type of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Justice  Toose, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  who is at the table knows, recommended that lawyers ought to be allowed to appear in appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will take my message back to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to decide whether the Commonwealth Government, especially as it now underwrites State hospitals by SO per cent under the Medibank arrangements might get together with the States and save a considerable amount of money by combining services available in Commonwealth and State hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is certainly incapable of being regarded as a radical or a progressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is shaking his head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is again shaking his head, but when the stage is reached where he has to reply he cursorily skates over all this sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He originally came from the Department of Treasury and naturally he would tend to express the same attitude as that from his <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me repeat the words uttered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  in his first statement to the House on the presentation of the first Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us leave the environmental questions, the global <span class="highlight">environment</span> interests and the moral questions aside for one moment and dwell upon the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That move in some countries has been temporarily held up by environmental objections and the general view that nuclear power is undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a possibility that during this period technological advances will reduce hazards to man and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, especially with regard to the treatment and disposal of highlevel radio active wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other factors which we have to consider in the second Fox report in respect of our mining and milling concern the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, national parks and Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that the requirements with regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and national parks are reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we must see that State and Federal environmental laws for uranium mining and export are coincidental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not have a situation where a mining company has to meet 2 separate overlapping environmental requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is at present no generally accepted means by which high level waste can be permanently isolated from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and remain sa te for very long periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I concede to the Friends of the Earth their right to speak up for a pure <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expansion of the  mining  operations from the Ranger to the Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits in the region and to other parts of Australia, based on experience acquired through cautious beginnings, will reduce the impact on the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> and allow for adjustments to be made in time, if need be, in relation with the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A risk with this type of storage is that tailings will escape to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> if the dam embankment is breached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at present no generally accepted means by which high level waste can be permanently isolated from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we combine those 3 points, to me they provide an unanswerable case as to why we should wait until scientists can tell us of a generally acceptable way of containing the dangers and of isolating them from the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must not let the sorts of safeguards that creep into what is predominantly a report to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> set aside other important issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have to make judgments as to whether sequential development of the mines is necessary or whether in fact there are other ways of going about the development of uranium resources which have not been put to Fox or which Fox has not thought of and which may enable work to get under way more quickly without any risk to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the Aboriginal population in the areas concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that my interest in matters of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation is well known to members of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who looks at the environmental problems of society today realises that the attitudes on <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the active capitalist and the active communist coincide, with equally bad results for their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the industry of the capitalist society the profit motive means that the environmental factors are probably amongst the last to receive consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the communist system, of course, the productivity target which industry has to meet is the important thing and the easiest thing to disregard is the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that that sort of cheap name calling directed at those who take a serious attitude on the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is unfortunate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  in response to questions I asked indicated that the Government’s monitoring of the public debate has been conducted by at least one official. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">environment</span> area and other major areas the United States seems to have a very sound policy line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has extensive deposits of uranium at a time when the world faces the need to make fundamental changes in its supply and use of energy resources, when there is growing concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live, and when there is anxiety over the proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that my Department which is the Department responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> has maintained an active involvement in the interdepartmental committees which have advised the Government on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry the Government, in formulating a policy in this matter, has taken into account the report of the Australian Safeguards Mission which was made late last year, the Prime Minister’s correspondence with  President  Carter and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada and the recent visit to North America by the Acting Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and several other Australian Government officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said all that, I say bluntly to the House that on the evidence gathered so far- it is a comprehensive analysis which I have before me- the majority of Australians are not opposed to the mining and export of uranium given adequate safeguards over the uses to which these exports may be put and the guaranteed protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the conservation of nature and the highest consideration for the interests of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The inquiry and these reports epitomise in a most comprehensive and profound way what environmental concerns are about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The definition of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act states: - - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span> includes all aspects of the surroundings of man, whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commissioners have scrupulously followed the implications of this definition and have reinforced the validity of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a dimension of concern, not only to governments but also to all Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The end point of an inquiry is the recommendations it makes, in the first place to the Minister responsible for environmental matters and then he- that is myself in this case- in turn carries them to the Government as a whole for its decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has flowed from four fundamental considerations: the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers region and of all other prople living in the region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In taking its decision on uranium mining, the national park, and Aboriginal land rights, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry commissioned under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principally because of the wide ranging nature of the Ranger Inquiry, I have decided that the environmental impact of a number of the matters considered by the Government and announced today have been adequately examined and taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is confident that decisions it has taken will provide the level of control necessary to ensure protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and I will return to this aspect later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If properly buried deep underground in geologically stable formations, there is little chance that these materials will re-enter the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in dangerous quantities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken a number of decisions to ensure nationwide protection of Australians and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of this Code will be to protect the health and safety of citizens of this country by ensuring protection of their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These elements will be based, where possible on existing international and overseas codes, and will assist in making environmental protection practices and procedures developed overseas more widely known in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry has noted the environmental problems that resulted from uranium mining at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection measures at Rum Jungle could not be considered adequate by today’s standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that the measures which I have announced today will ensure that current and future uranium mining undertaken anywhere in Australia will be subject to adequate <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended, legislative action will be taken to enable the Director to enforce <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection provisions, particularly by way of injunction to restrain or compel action, and to give the Supreme Court a wide discretion as to the exercise of its jurisdiction in such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will proceed to develop the rest of the Park as quickly as possible; in the meantime its protection will be ensured through special control exercised jointly by the Departments of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, National Resources, Northern Territory and Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry recommended that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection of the Alligator Rivers Region could be accomplished in two ways, of which the establishment of a major national park was first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second element recommended by the Ranger Inquiry was the development of specific arrangements to protect the natural and historic features of the Alligator Rivers <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to protect the Aboriginal people who have lived there for centuries and to protect the mine workers and their families who will take up residence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry recommended that the total level of activity in the Region should be limited to minimise the impact of both the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on the lifestyle of the Aboriginal residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided to appoint an officer, to be known as the Supervising Scientist, to exercise a supervisory and integrating role over all research and monitoring programs associated with environmental protection from the hazards of uranium development in the Alligator Rivers Region and to advise on the specific environmental requirements for the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry the Supervising Scientist will be responsible to myself as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and I hope to announce an appointment in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has confirmed that any proposals to develop further mines in the Region should be subject to the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act before any government decisions on these mines are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before such decisions are taken the Government will need to be satisfied about the acceptability of the environmental impact on the Region of the development of the mine concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the Act to other mining proposals in the Region will ensure that the Government will have all the facts on the environmental implications of these proposals when decisions on them are required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the national Minister concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> I believe the thrust of the many recommendations of the Inquiry to be entirely consonant with proper environmental protection, and it will be clear from my statement today that the Government takes a similar view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will thereby ensure the protection of the Australian public including the Aboriginal people and our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and will in so doing protect the Alligator Rivers Region with its rich archaeological sites, abundant wildlife, diverse and interesting vegetation, and exciting and beautiful scenery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  has in addition outlined the environmental controls to be adopted by the Government and he briefly referred to some of the health aspects of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Code deals with radiation protection aspects only and is not concerned with the other potential hazards or with the broader environmental issues already elaborated on by my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Code was accepted by both this and the previous Government and was submitted in the evidence my Department gave to the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has accepted and indeed gone further than this recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and, as already indicated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Code Will be included in the Uniform National Code of Practice which will be established by the Commonwealth, with the States, by appropriate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It commits Australia to renewed export of uranium regardless of the absence of procedures for the storage and disposal of radio-active wastes to eliminate the danger to human life and health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox Commission was equally emphatic on the second great danger posed to human beings and our <span class="highlight">environment</span> by the use of nuclear materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  could only point to processes which have only- in his words, ‘proved to be technically feasible at pilot plant’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a world that has become deeply and properly conscious of the need to preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its responsibility to future generations, the nuclear industry offers an unprecedented threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development gave mutually contradictory statements on this subject today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s irresponsibility was laid bare in the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as far as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is concerned, other countries, other generations, must solve the problems by which we profit here and now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes which will eliminate any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are problems in many areas- economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental, technical and Aboriginal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased risk of nuclear war and the dangers to human life and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of radioactive waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statements are completely unsatisfactory with regard to environmental safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not the slightest doubt that uranium mining will destroy forever the unique <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator River flood plains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the mining area has been excluded from the national park boundaries, even Koongarra which the Prime Minister concedes is the most delicate <span class="highlight">environment</span> of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the safeguards to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are contemptible; the respect for the rights of Aborigines is beneath contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arguments relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of the Aboriginal people are tremendously compelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear honourable members opposite attempting to argue that in the months in which the two Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry reports have been available there has been a lack of opportunity for debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we see them again, notwithstanding what is stated in the reports of the Fox Inquiry, arguing by way of these rather nonsensical approaches that we have to solve problems of storage and disposal of radioactive waste and that we have to have adequate measures to safeguard the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, national parks and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The documents which we have received today clearly indicate that every recommendation contained in the Fox report in relation to measures considered necessary to safeguard our <span class="highlight">environment</span> to provide for national parks and to protect Aboriginals and their interests, have been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (c) of the proposed amendment states that the following problem must be solved: procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes which will eliminate any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  have taken a particularly offhand attitude to this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cynicism of the government on this matter is best illustrated in the statement by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  when he states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at present no generally accepted means by which high level wastes can be permanently isolated from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and remain safe for very long periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of the Ranger project, the Government says it has accepted all of the Ranger recommendations relating to environmental controls and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also has indicated in respect of the development of other mining in the Alligator Rivers Region that future developments will take place only when the projects were in harmony with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and when the Government is satisfied that the impact of such developments will not be detrimental to the Aboriginal people or the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to environmental aspects, I and members of the Government committee on natural resources went to Arnhem Land and the Alligator River province last year and looked at the projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are very impressed with the statements today made by the Prime Minister, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (  Mr Viner). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to incorporate in  Hansard  a table setting out the real cuts m the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development over the last two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papers were presented by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources  (Mr Anthony),  the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator River region, and of all other people living in the region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and this is being done by the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned a short while ago that we traversed wide areas of the uranium fields in this country and we found that the mining companies were restoring the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the extent that it was better than prior to the mining operation taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we saw trees being planted and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> being completely restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that nuclear wastes can be disposed of permanently in geological formations in such a way that there is very little prospect of material escaping into the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research has traced the path of plutonium in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and its behaviour is very well understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided that the Prime Minister, the Minister for National Resources  (Mr Anthony),  the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Sinclair),  the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  should make statements, and those statements were printed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the need to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which mining development will take place; and the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare and interests of the Aboriginal people and all other people working on development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With application of the best current techniques to ensure safety for the workers, <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection, regard for Aboriginal land rights, and an obligation to rehabilitate areas damaged by mining, one can accept the (Fox) report’s conclusion that there is no adequate reason why Australian uranium should not be mined and supplied at the world price to those countries that have elected to develop nuclear power and can be trusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one visits the Alligator River area of the Northern Territory and looks at the mines there one will find an interference with the ecology systems which is likely to produce serious hazards for the whole <span class="highlight">environment</span> because it is almost impossible to guarantee that there will not be leakage of radioactivity into the water systems of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is accepted that the mining and milling of uranium, particularly given the location of the main known deposits, pose major issues to be resolved in relation to the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in relation to the Aborigines in the areas concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development of these deposits therefore must be handled with extreme care and sensitivity, not only in relation to the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> but, more importantly, in relation to the social and cultural wellbeing of the up to 800 Aborigines who are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter for the Government but the Government must take into consideration the views of the Australian people and the dangers to the Australian people and to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as well as the question of plutonium’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development announce on 12 August 1976 that the Government had decided that the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will not be applied to the Australian Capital Territory; if so, and in view of the inadequacy of the existing Public Parks Ordinance 1933 of the Australian Capital Territory, what steps does he intend to take to ensure the protection for the benefit of future generations of Australians of areas of national importance such as the Mount Ainslie-Majura foothills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I tend to think that rural industries would be well served if some of the attention that has been devoted to that particular question were devoted to other policies- to compensating policies- for rural industries so that they can operate within the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> on a proper and competitive basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Prime Minister emphasised that Australia would not store nuclear waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view, public indignation will grow more intense as the Australian people learn more of the detrimental results uranium mining can have, not only on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on fish and tree life but also on the health of our nationals, particularly those who mine it and the unborn, not to mention the raping of traditional Aboriginal lands and sacred dream areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Uranium mining in the Northern Territory, commonly referred to as the Top End of Australia, will destroy the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> on which the Aborigines depend for the survival of their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree that there are many people who have been terrorised by a concerted campaign of arrant bomb-happy nonsense being spread around the society and which will continue to be spread around the society by people motivated, I believe, in the main not by any real concern for Australia or for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but by a desperate search for an issue which somehow will transport them back to the political Elysium from which I hope they have been banished for ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The project was not considered new in that it had reached an advanced stage in planning and development and substantial exploration and development expenditure had already been incurred, some of which dated back to the early 60s; also, mining leases had been granted by the Queensland authorities laying down, amongst other things, stringent conditions to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An announcement was made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, that the regulatory powers in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 197S should not be used in the Australian Capital and Jervis Bay Territories, but this decision was made on the understanding that legislation of similar breadth would be introduced for these Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am informed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development that any significant future proposals for the foothills or other areas of the Australian Capital Territory will be subject to the scrutiny of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The object of this Act is to ensure that the significant environmental issues of any Commonwealth action are thoroughly examined before decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was with this object in mind that he directed the preparation of an environmental impact statement on the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority’s proposal to extend its 132kv sub-transmission around Belconnen and North Canberra, including the extension along the Mount Ainslie-Majura foothills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Duck Creek runs into the Parramatta River which in turn runs into Sydney Harbour the interrelationship of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> had to be understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first thing that the Opposition will say is: ‘Of course, that is what we are saying; we want a healthy and safe <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately people in this country who have every right to be concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- people in this country have freedom to do so- are being led on, unfortunately, by some of the people that the Opposition represents in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the subject under discussion now, the Government’s policy on the mining and sale of uranium, is being used by the Government as a stooge in an endeavour to stir up division in this country and create the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for a law and order election which it can pull on at a minute’s notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a typical example by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My experience after examining government bodies throughout Australia as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is that we need some overall authority or functional unit which can bring everything into focus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously the Government has to create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which will maximise the opportunities for people to invest in private enterprise with the hope of reward and not allow their funds to be used to a significant degree in the manner in which I have just been talking about, that is, to be used by the Government again for other developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where people will take risks in creating job opportunities by allowing them a reasonable chance of a reward for effort expended and risks undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> That affects almost every major State works program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the cuts is in expenditure on public hearings in respect of environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the complexities one must take into consideration are: Our contractual commitments-obligations which were entered into prior to 1972, which the Whitlam Government said would be honoured and which we said would be honoured; our commitment to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty; the handling of waste material; the further proliferation of nuclear material around the world; the codes of mining and the safety of people involved in the milling of uranium; the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; national parks; and Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since receiving the report now being tabled, my attention has been drawn to a statement in the other place on 7 September 1977 by  Senator Jessop  on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> following that Committee ‘s examination of the Board ‘s 1975-76 annual report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to tell me whether the current Press reports regarding renegotiations of arrangements for the Albury-Wodonga growth centre are accurate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the strategic matters I have referred to, we also take into consideration factors of our physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>, technological developments and developments in methods of waging war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are family crises which are in no way related to temperament or conduct; they could be related to economic circumstances, such as poor housing, poor <span class="highlight">environment</span>, or lack of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hazards to members of the public in the general <span class="highlight">environment</span> arise at all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the effects of the establishment of a nuclear power station upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then and only then will our people be informed of the crucial matters relating to the degree of radiation emissions, and their possible effects on health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the dispersal of radioactive wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, there is the need to protect effectively our <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which mining development will take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to protect our Aboriginal people and our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I believe that there are good economic as well as environmental reasons for sequential development, as  Mr Justice  Fox and his commissioners recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least something has rubbed off- the bilateral agreements with at least some safeguards; at least some government participation in the Ranger venture, however halfhearted that has been; and at least some protection for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For them it is better to hold the election when the political <span class="highlight">environment</span> is bad rather than waiting for it to get terrible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the fact that at a recent seminar on urban management processes two officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development produced a paper in which they claimed that the lack of relative price effect was a major reason for the apparent increase in the size of the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity to draw attention to some work being done at the Australian National University at the present time on this matter of relative shares of our gross domestic product going to the public and private sector over a longer period than the period which was the subject of assessment by the two officers from the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we get the present problem in Australia that because a child might have poor parents he is to remain deprived and a victim of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> into which he was born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is scope for expansion in oilseeds production but, if this potential is to be realised, the industry must develop on a sound basis with an increased research effort to improve yields, combat pests and diseases and, in particular, as you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  would know so well as  Chairman  of our Government Rural Committee, it is very necessary to develop varieties that are suitable to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  first announced some of the details which he wished to discuss with State Premiers the Labor States were most reluctant to join in with what should be an objective for all political parties, that is, the provision of housing for those people genuinely in need rather than a continuance of support for some individuals who should not be receiving the very great benefits which are obvious under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some years now the Commonwealth has also taken the lead in providing special purpose grants to the States to assist them in undertaking activities within a variety of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a standing piece of legislation that will be available to provide a proper and convenient means for the Commonwealth to assist the States financially with respect to matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the Minister to agree with a State upon financial assistance and, acting jointly with the appropriate State Minister, to approve projects relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in essence a simple Bill, but it is, nevertheless, a significant pokey decision which emphasises again the Government’s concern to work co-operatively with the States, through well established means in the interests of responsible and rational management of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  indicated that the magnitude of the Commonwealth’s contribution would be of the order of $5m over the period mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that, although this legislation is the preserve of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  or the Minister for National Resources  (Mr Anthony),  in fact it was introduced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly our own Minister from Tasmania,  Mr Kevin  Newman, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, has done much work on this issue and is very concerned for the people of Queenstown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tasmania Grant (The Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited) Bill 1977 has many shortcomings which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  sought to hide in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be noted that since this minute was drafted by the Department of Foreign Affairs as a record of discussion, there have been many discussions between  Mr Justice  Fox and experts overseas about these matters and I know he has put views forthrightly and constructively, seeking a better and an eversafer international <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee supports the view that visitation to environmentally significant and sensitive areas should be controlled and in some cases restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It recommends that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development identify those areas requiring long term management plans to protect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first two paragraphs of the Labor Party’s policy on uranium state that we recognise that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the economic welfare of our people, and the rights and well-being of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Labor believes that, having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium, the development of nuclear power should not continue at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the annual report for 1977 of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following an exhaustive evaluation of all tenders received covering all options it was decided that the offer by North Queensland Engineers and Agents would provide the Navy and Army with craft which met all requirements and particularly would be the most suitable for operating in the arduous service <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 5 May 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who believes that all the gold plated trimmings and so on are needed in education to make teaching effective, but certainly teaching is easier and more effective if the equipment and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably due to some personality problem, the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> or some other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that environmental matters have been very low on this Government’s priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However there is not much moral or financial support given to environmental and conservation programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example is the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, which probably is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two studies were undertaken under the terms of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had wide ramifications and it is very interesting to note that although both reports were brought down during the last two years, no proposal has been referred to the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The area represented by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman)  probably has one of the Government’s lowest priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the mining of uranium, as I said earlier, both the first and second reports of the Ranger inquiry were brought down under the terms of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development did not make all the recommendations; they were made by the Minister for National Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is of great significance environmentally in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is subordinate to its championing of the uranium miners rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is in fact subordinate to this Government’s priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government will have to exert control if the State governments will not control this very delicate part of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I am pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKelllar)  in his second reading speech did stress that if we are going to control our <span class="highlight">environment</span> the only way we can control it is by a spirit of co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of my criticism of this Bill is that on the environmental front and the conservation front this Government has such very low priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of accepting the proposition, as reported, that there should be sequential development of uranium mining in the areas and that only the Ranger mine should go ahead first to ascertain what problems would be created in this delicate environmental area- that would have been bad enough- the Government rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simultaneous development of those two mines not only will have a grave effect on that delicate <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also will have a grave effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the human beings in that area, that is, the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, whilst not opposing the Bill, the Opposition criticises and in some cases condemns the priority given to environmental and conservation matters of protecting our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that for too long we in Australia did not really appreciate the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one can be critical of the previous era, one has to say that much of the development by the early settlers in this country was carried out without any significance being attached to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the preservation of our great natural resources for the use of the generations that would follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in paying a tribute to the previous Government for sparking off an interest m the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as far as Australia as a nation is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the small acorn that was planted will grow into a great tree so that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be protected, so that we will not challenge nature and so that future generations will be able to enjoy the benefits of what nature can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can criticise it for not spreading its umbrella widely enough or not gathering into its fold aU the things in which environmentalists are interested; but it is a start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget that this type of legislation will act as a catalyst to encourage private individuals and organisations to play their part in the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and particularly the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, we want to work with the States so that man can live with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and does not become a victim of his own misuse of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this year’s Budget, due to the efforts of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  $2.55m was allocated for the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is all about, the preservation for those who come after us of typical Australian things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 know that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will use his considerable persuasive powers to get the Cabinet and the State governments to agree to a massive onslaught on the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is good to see in the Minister’s second reading speech- I compliment him on the fact- that the Government, through the Aus.tralian Environmental Council, will move positively towards comprehensive and co-ordinated regulations for the export and import of environmentally hazardous chemicals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But viewed against the background of a government moving in the right direction with great financial restrictions placed on it on account of the state of the economy, this is a positive proof to the Australian people that we are serious about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to spend a few moments this afternoon in supporting the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> (Financial Assistance) Bill which was presented to the House by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to summarise the financial aspects of the Government’s approach to environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I do not regard the Bill as a major controversy for the House, I must say that quite consistent with the inability of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to sustain expenditure in other areas for which he is responsible, there has been this heavy decline in funding of environmental activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me mention briefly the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environmental impact allocation for public hearings is down from $694,300 in 1975-76, to $507,268 in 1976-77, to $65,000 in 1977-78. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is in regard to environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government promised in its election policy on <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation a public inquiry on the wood chip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think a matter of concern is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has allowed his Department to be whittled away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The staff ceilings have affected the environmental area quite considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If their concern for the truth half matched their concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I think they would be a lot better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put the facts on this matter of the Government’s concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We come to the linchpin of our policies, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have acted under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, whether the matter in question was the Concorde aircraft or wood chipping on the south coast of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Act there are two alternativeseither a public inquiry or administrative procedures with an environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I chose the environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose we can take some wry satisfaction from the fact that hundreds of people try at elections to serve in this arduous and competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Consultative Parties also recommended to their Governments that they continue to study the environmental implications of mineral resource activities in the Antarctic Treaty area and to hold a meeting of ecological, technical and other related experts with a view to developing scientific programs aimed at improving predictions of the impact of possible technologies for mineral exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic and developing measures for the prevention of damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-76">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Consultative Parties also recommended that their Governments cooperate broadly and comprehensively in scientific investigation and in the exchange of information relating to the Antarctic marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and that they intensify as far as possible scientific research related to Antarctic marine living resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-76">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 20 October 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-99">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 5 October 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-113">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) On what date did the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development receive the final report of the Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-114">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) On 2 1 October 1976,  Dr John  Hookey, the Presiding Commissioner, forwarded four copies of the Final Report of the Commission of Inquiry to my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-114">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April 1 975 the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> heard evidence to the effect that the total Tasmanian Aboriginal population was between 4,000 and 5,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-139">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Brown)  and others, when I say that I believe you have brought to your office and this place, great dignity, an important sense of propriety and, in what is often an electric and intense <span class="highlight">environment</span>, fairness and impartiality, and a very welcome sense of humour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government took much of the burden of improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from ratepayers and it gave dignity and pride in their work to people who, in  some  cases, are now becoming cynical of ever being acceptable in the work force because there are dozens of registered unemployed chasing each job vacancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the Whitlam years I was  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw an end to ad hockery and the beginning of a rational and national approach to so many problems- the problems of urban life, manufacturing industry and education, the immense problems faced by Aboriginal people, the inadequacies of childhood services and health care delivery services, the conservation of our natural and built <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the development of our natural resources and the upgrading and bringing into the twentieth century of our international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That cannot necessarily be translated into the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> in exactly the same terms but there is a range of things which are often meant by people when they talk about worker participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development who is responsible for youth affairs for initiating the research project into youth unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development aware of recent Press reports that the traditional Australian team colours may be changed for the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would expect that refugees might have difficulty in settling into a new <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in finding work within that new <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A project which may attract a grant or loan moneys under this Bill would include ‘the conservation of water resources or water <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ and ‘the management of water quality’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be appreciated that over much of Australia rainfall is highly variable both seasonally and from year to year and that floods and droughts are characteristic of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the management of water there is abundant evidence of the interdependence of the elements of the whole <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All our water resources- rivers, streams, lakes and aquifersand the ecosystems associated with them, must be managed in a way which as far as possible will provide overall enhancement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the management strategies adopted for Australia’s inland waters must give full consideration to the effects on estuarine and marine environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence it is particularly appropriate in the case of water resources projects that they are planned and assessed not only on the basis of the extent to which they influence economic growth, but also on the basis of their impact on social well being, on regional development, and on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous conferences in the series have been the conference on <span class="highlight">environment</span> which was held in Stockholm in 1972, the conference on food which was held in Rome in 1974, the conference in Bucharest in 1975 which dealt with population, and the Habitat Conference held in Vancouver in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic intent in conducting the United Nations Conference on Water was to allow nations to develop an objective policy for the supply of water for basic nutritional, environmental and health requirements of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the recommendations to be taken nationally, all delegations endorsed the objectives, policies and guidelines relating to the appropriate action for water development and conservation including the adoption of national water policy statements, the development of appropriate technologies, flood and drought loss management, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and health, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  might well lead a team from the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, I again speak briefly, this time in respect to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)-  I will have grace enough to congratulate him on his appointment- will find some pleasure in his association with the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these committees come into being, we will not be able to rise at the start of a new parliamentary session and deal with subject matter committees such as the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the Standing Committee on Road Safety, the Standing Committee on Tourism and the others without giving some consideration to the overall picture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am an enthusiast of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we take a proper look at the committee system it may well be that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee and some of the other subject matter committees may have to disappear as entities and that the subject matter they examine be covered by some other committees so that the most important matters in a wide variety of fields can be dealt with by members of this Parliament in the limited time they have available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should also be required to give attention to the reasons for its de-emphasis upon the Government’s desire, as expressed in the Act to ‘facilitate adjustment to changes in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, by the industries and people affected by such changes’ and to give attention to the wisdom of its apparent rejection of any government intervention in the economy which is not general and not market-orientated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more we care for the deprived, the more we think about the problems confronting Australian manufacturing industry, the more we confront the hardships faced by the rural community, the more we grapple with the major issues concerning the <span class="highlight">environment</span> the more we realise the need for increased government intervention on behalf of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is much as it was when Australia was discovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to create the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which all people can live and work with the maximum individual freedom and human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>AU aspects of government have their effect on people- defence, taxation, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, foreign relations and public works, among others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report found that the special branch kept files on people active in almost any progressive force in the State; from peace movements to the women’s movement and to conservationists simply trying to save the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government inherited a housing <span class="highlight">environment</span> which has made progress quite difficult to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the time in which to prepare for this debate was very limited one would not need a great deal of practice to demolish the attitude of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new agreement will also encourage the States to give additional attention to the environmental aspects of public housing, such as urban renewal, provision of open space, landscaping and community facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, under the new Agreement, provision is made for note to be taken of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the surroundings and the way of life of the people involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer Opposition members to a statement made in the middle of last year by the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the present Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem that the present Government has adopted- I am convinced that that is the case under our new and dynamic Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)-  an innovative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly it should be so designed to teach people, and particularly youngsters, where and how they fit into the unbelievably complex <span class="highlight">environment</span> of which they are an integral part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Potential gains from an outward looking export strategy towards Asia in a progressively de-red taped economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> are striking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have pointed out consistently that if there are to be any changes in protection levels, they should proceed only in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which there are appropriate structural adjustment programs such as compensation, retraining, relocation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policies include a proper decision on the North West Shelf which allows the consortium involved an investment <span class="highlight">environment</span> where it knows it has markets for its natural gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are difficulties associated with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and health in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis is to the effect that safeguards are effective, that the problems of disposal have been solved, that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is safeguarded and that the rights of Aborigines are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps even more seriously is the ever escalating tendency for cities and living environments to be shaped by the private motor vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the post-war period in Australia and in other comparable countries governments have been goaded by the powerful financial, industrial and automobile association lobby groups to spend almost unlimited funds on roads and other improvements designed to promote without limit the use of a motorised vehicle for every transport task, no matter how inappropriate or no matter what the cost to the non-user or to the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most dramatic example of the imbalance of priorities which has been characteristic of Australian transport planning has been the attempts made in almost every Australian city to construct urban freeways, a form which is intrinsically alien to the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Residents and councillors have together resisted every overture and even a handsome bribe in the belief that the expected traffic volume of 70,000 vehicles a day would destroy the social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the present Government, as in so many other areas, has allowed the Environmental Protection Act to be watered down so that we now have the absurd situation in Victoria where in my own electorate in the City of Heidelberg in respect of the Bell Street-Banksia Street connection, the construction authority is carrying out its own impact studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation is that the unions, by heavy handed blackmail tactics, are forcing themselves on major employers who are being forced to buckle under because the employers cannot afford, in the competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the building industry, to close down the job for a protracted period while litigation takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pleased to see that the Government and the Opposition appreciate that the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia emphasises the importance of maritime surveillance, reconnaissance and offshore patrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think any member on either side of this House, the people in the defence forces or the people in the civil section of the structure have yet conditioned themselves to look at a new Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One condition is that cognisance be taken of the report on softwoods of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that any clearing of hardwood forests for the purpose of replanting would not be in the best interests of the long-term future of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> or of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I refer, as did the previous speaker, to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation inquired into the operation of the 1967 and 1972 Acts with particular reference, which I will mention in part, to their environmental, social and economic impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Timber is a versatile, renewable material which compared with other building materials can be produced at lower costs, with far less use of our dwindling energy supplies and with less damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the summary report of the sixth meeting of the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers, Cairns, 29 July 1977, and the summary record of proceedings of the ninth meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, Canberra, 1 1 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At stake is their culture, their social structure, their traditions, their <span class="highlight">environment</span>, their sacred sites and their religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to deal with the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the restoration of mined land because the Aboriginal people talked to him about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aurukuns expressed disappointment that the companies had not adequately consulted with them, especially upon the effect the proposed mining development would have upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people have been happy with the assurances that CRA has been able to give them in relation to safeguarding the physical and social <span class="highlight">environment</span> of that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim of the exercise was to further develop the tactical employment of a balanced combat force in a remote location under terrain and the climate <span class="highlight">environment</span> represented at Woomera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 22 February 1 978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-71">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>am asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is primarily for the authorities in the country concerned to ensure that proper safety measures and <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection measures are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since this Parliament resumed just a few weeks ago it has established committees on such important matters as road safety, tourism, Aboriginal affairs, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation, foreign affairs and defence, public works, expenditure and a new and permanent Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of jobs in the public sector in response to urgent social needs in fields such as health, adult education, <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection and social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sooner or later all such processes must overload their <span class="highlight">environment</span>, consuming all its nutrients or poisoning it by the waste products associated with growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third factor which ought to be looked at in the light of our amendment is the question of environmental conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least in the previous Bills some attention was paid to environmental considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I refer to the 1975 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts of 1967 and 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not exactly enlightening as far as environmental factors are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the 1972 Act more note was taken of environmental factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to remind the House of some of the matters that were commented upon in the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation published in 1975, and I wish to refer firstly to some of the findings set out on page 3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another recommendation was that stringent conditions should be imposed upon the lending of Federal money to ensure that forestry management procedures designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are observed strictly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the wisdom of Solomon, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation recommended at that time that the next softwood forestry agreements legislation should cover a period of 10 years- that was not accepted by the Government- with interest accruing from the commencement of the loan and with deferment of the payments of instalments of principle and interest for 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if honourable members read paragraph 159 of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and in particular sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) and clauses (a) to (1) they will see the common-sense approach of this all party Committee to the sort of environmental factors that we should be talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is a Bill of little substance because it states that the Commonwealth Government, for this next five years, will not be involved in some of the matters it was during the previous five years because of a very good consensus with the States and because of advice received from people such as the honourable member for Scullin in his capacity, some time ago, as the  chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the presentation of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation when the honourable member for Sculling was its  chairman  and also a very detailed report entitled  The Australian Softwoods Products Industry  by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, it has been discovered that the earlier projections over-estimated the demand and that at this stage this excess demand will not be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must keep this subject in mind I suppose when we speak about the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will mention briefly some of the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think he was accurate when he said that the Government has paid no attention to environmental issues in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report discusses rather extensively some of the environmental issues that we need to face with respect to softwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a pretty strong notion at least that softwood planted in Australia after clear felling of the native timber has had a detrimental effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> with respect to primary production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could argue that those people, by their very existence, have had a detrimental effect on some other aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is generally believed that those people probably should have first preference in terms of some minor detriment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct perhaps from the softwood industry which, if it creates problems for our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is in a better position to be cut back, probably in favour of native hardwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Scullin, when presenting the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation dealing with the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreement Acts 1967 and 1972, said:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is for greater research to be conducted into the side effects of softwood forestry upon all the environmental issues raised in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like an opportunity to say that in my view the people employed in the Forestry Commission who manage the softwood plantations and the hardwood plantations in my electorate are the true conservationists who, in their dealings with both the softwood and the hardwood <span class="highlight">environment</span>, have always been very careful in their management techniques to take account of any environmental factors that they find could be detrimental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without trying to expand the debate outside the softwood area, but keeping to the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I want to refer to the woodchipping industry on the South Coast, which has created a lot of heartburning in some sections, especially to some people in the Australian Capital Territory who have created a great deal of protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view- I have to admit that I do not have a degree in biology, but I have a great interest in the welfare of my electorate- the present regeneration of our native forests is being very well managed, especially in the area of wildlife and some of the areas mentioned in the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that at times the State Government is being put on by people who do not take the trouble to investigate fully the impact of the forests on either the local <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the local communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when it is revised in five years’ time it will be changed to one in favour of greater plantings, if not of radiata, of other softwoods which are more in line with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and which indicate better replacement possibilities and perhaps a greater population in the early years of the next century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that an interesting insight into the mind of the conservative was gained by listening to the speech last night of the honourable member for Barker  (Mr Porter)  when he referred to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation entitled ‘The Operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreement Acts 1967 and 1972’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many side effects of softwood forestry upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which require more attention and care than are currently being given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater mechanisation of forestry activities has increasing consequences for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, especially where water quality is affected - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timber is a versatile, renewable material which compared with other building materials can be produced at lower costs, with far less use of our dwindling energy supplies, and with less damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater mechanisation of forestry activities has increasing consequences for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, especially where water quality is affected and where it enables the clearfelling of larger areas of native forest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Stringent conditions should be imposed upon the lending of Federal money to ensure that forestry management procedures designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are strictly observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, in moving this amendment, has made reference to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts of 1967 and 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister then acknowledged that the Commonwealth would normally require an <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact study where forestry areas were to be cleared for the purpose of planting softwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made clear by the Minister in his second reading speech to the 1976 Bill that the States had been advised that should the Commonwealth and States enter into agreements for a further period it would be necessary to comply with the administrative procedures and the terms of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If and when further plantings take place it is important that those plantings so far as possible are on existing cleared land or if any clearing is required then the plantings should proceed on marginal land and in the latter circumstances only when the Commonwealth has given its agreement after consideration of a report prepared under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I return to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and in particular to the terms of the Committee’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recommend: that further substantial pine planting, at the expense of native forest, be discontinued until more research has established the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of, and the economic justification for, present practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that wood-chipping operations or other operations involving clear-felling of large areas be discontinued until the environmental effects are better known and properly assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole debate has centred on the domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span>- domestic supply and demandwithout any regard whatsoever for the global view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to the Bill, although a number of Government speakers have maintained that this legislation is very favourable from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I suggest that this view indicates a very shallow analysis of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On deeper analysis one finds that in fact this legislation is anti the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in many aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contention here is that the more we plant now and the more we have surplus in the future the greater the disadvantage to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man-made forests have a 16-times greater yield than the native forests, and yet the environmentalists argue against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate reference has been made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, which recommended in its report that an immediate study be carried out by a body such as the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to determine the economic viability of the softwood planting program on both strict financial grounds and on the broadest cost benefit grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> benefits of directing a much greater new planting effort to previously cleared land are obvious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Denison and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  were among those who asked: ‘Why pull out the apple trees in Tasmania?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is disgraceful that the unctuous Ministers for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development have sat on this report for nearly two years without bothering to act on the proposals for flood mitigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My good friend, the honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage),  wrote to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on 4 February 1977 requesting information on what action the Minister intended to take on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in consultation with the respective State Governments, will be concerned to continue to improve the safety of the working <span class="highlight">environment</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Bill, and in the Bills that follow the Government gives evidence of its determination to strike a responsible balance between economic development and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 an inquiry was instituted under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 into the proposal by the Ranger consortium to develop uranium deposits at a site some 200 kilometres east of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fundamentally, the inquiry was designed to provide a basis on which the Government could take responsible decisions for environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commission was appointed to inquire, and I quote from its terms of reference:  in respect of all the environmental aspects of: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second report contained recommendations on measures to ensure that the necessary degree of environmental protection was provided over the full period of uranium mining developments in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced last August, the Government decided that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the region would be protected from the consequences of uranium mining through a series of actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To appoint a Supervising Scientist to coordinate <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to collect data on the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the region of uranium mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is concerned with the development and promotion of standards, practices and procedures for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and with measures for protection and restoration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third main function is to co-ordinate and supervise the implementation of requirements for <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection under prescribed instruments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Co-ordinating Committee are essentially to assist the Supervising Scientist in his role of protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the effects of uranium mining operations in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will consider and recommend programs for the collection of data, consider and keep under review standards, practices, procedures and measures for environmental protection and restoration and keep under review requirements and their implementation under prescribed instruments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Co-ordinating Committee is the focal point of the system proposed by the Government for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of uranium mining operations in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Co-ordinating Committee is to provide a forum and a mechanism for these interests and organisations to communicate, consult, consider and reach understandings and agreements on the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the task of the Supervising Scientist, presiding at meetings of the Coordinating Committee, to obtain comprehensive and co-ordinated advice and recommendations which take account of all interests and which have as their primary objective the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from uranium mining in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be pleased to know that under the direction of  Mr Robert  Fry, who has been seconded from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to undertake preliminary functions of the proposed Supervising Scientist, steps have already been taken to establish monitoring of base-line environmental conditions in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using temporary field laboratories, a significant amount of work has already been undertaken to establish a data base for later development of environmental protection programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this Bill and the Bills that follow demonstrate the Government’s determination to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the region, and to safeguard the interests of people in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill which I have just introduced dealt with scientific institutions and arrangements- the establishment of an Office of a Supervising Scientist and a Scientific Research Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginals, with their long involvement with and concern for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, have a key role to play in park management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who represents in this chamber the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack),  will be introducing a Bill to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in relation to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, or the appropriate Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will note that the definition of the region in this Bill differs from that contained in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill which I have already introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain provisions in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court ) Bill are related to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of Kakadu National Park is indicative of this Government’s concern for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and Aboriginal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highly skilled and innovative persons sensitive to the special requirements of the Aboriginal people and sensitive to the unique nature of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region will be needed to ensure the success of the Government’s intentions in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry was concerned to ensure that the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Land Council should be able to reinforce the environmental protection machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has already indicated that the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will be amended to provide for the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to have appropriate rights of inspection and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, together with the related Bills which are being introduced today, is a further earnest of the Government’s determination that the development of uranium mining in Australia will be carefully controlled and proceed in a responsible manner with full regard to the need for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Bill is to establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will enable governments to ensure that the nuclear industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to the people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with the health and safety of people, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that nuclear material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should an unforeseen situation arise as a result of a nuclear activity, which is not regulated or controlled by a Commonwealth, State or Territory law, and which is likely to affect health, safety or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the GovernorGeneral will have power, under clause 13 of the Bill, to authorise the appropriate Federal Minister to act to control hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is our judgment, after considering all relevant factors, that a contingency provision of this nature is a proper and responsible discharge of our duty to provide for the health and safety of people in Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orders made under the provisions of this clause have effect only in relation to situations likely to affect health and safety, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, that arise from nuclear activities, as denned in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initial drafting by the appropriate Commonwealth department, for example, Department of Health for health codes, Department of Transport for transport codes, Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development for general <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection codes; consultation  on  the proposed draft code with relevant State and Territory Ministers; the release, where appropriate, of the draft code for public comment, particularly by industry and trade unions; consideration of the draft code by relevant advisory councils such as the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council; final consideration within the Government and submission to the Governor-General; the provision of an order in writing by the Governor-General approving the code; tabling of the order approving the code of practice in both Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding I want to emphasise that this Bill is designed solely to protect Australians and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is responsible environmental legislation that will provide for the development of protection measures in respect to nuclear activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body of eminent non-government professional people has already played a most significant part in advising the Government on the effects of the various actual and potential sources of ionising radiation exposure on the Australian population and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation demonstrates very clearly our determination to see that uranium development in Australia is regulated and controlled to ensure the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the health and safety of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry saw the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council as having a special interest in reinforcing the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection machinery in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It saw as an advantage of the recommendations it made with regard to Aboriginal ownership of land and the creation of the national park that there would be people with the interest and knowledge to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Inquiry therefore recommended that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection provisions be made legally enforceable and that both the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council be given the right to enforce those provisions, particularly by way of injunction to restrain or compel action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife or the Northern Land Council, to make orders for the enforcement, in relation to uranium mining, of environmental requirements which are contained in Commonwealth and Northern Territory laws and in instruments made under those laws, and it gives the Court a wide discretion as to the exercise of this jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that the Bill does not give the Court power to impose new environmental requirementsonly to make orders in relation to requirements which are imposed elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides that the Court may order the repayment of costs incurred in work to remedy any detriment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that last August the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development stated that strict environmental controls and standards in relation to uranium mining would be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the Government is presently examining the nature of environmental requirements, consistent with the environmental controls agreed on by the Government last August, that would be included in the grant of a mining authority to the Ranger consortium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will carry legal force and will, of course, be subject to supervision by the supervising authorities in the region and subject also to the oversight and co-ordination processes established in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the administrative procedures under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Queensland Mines Ltd have prepared draft environmental impact statements on the development of the Jabiluka and Nabarlek deposits respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Western Mining Corporation also made available for public comment a draft environmental impact statement on its research plant at Kalgoorlie proposed in connection with the Yeelirrie deposit in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As indicated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  provision is being made in the Bill to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to protect wildlife and natural features in the stage 2 area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to meeting Aboriginal interests in the area and the necessary environmental controls, the Government will be proceeding with a tightly controlled exploration program so that the resources of the stage 2 area can be identified and appropriate action taken as quickly as possible to enable the proclamation of the area as a national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conduct of these tests and the evaluation of the results obtained are matters on which questions might more properly be addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-48-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government supported the Rathburnie Environmental Education Estate at Linville in the Brisbane Valley or any other project which aims to demonstrate the long-term commercial viability of land and <span class="highlight">environment</span> conservation practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not supported the Rathburnie Environmental Education Estate at Linville in the Brisbane Valley, however, under the States Grants (Soil Conservation) Act 1974 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> (Financial Assistance) Act 1977 the following projects aimed at demonstrating the long-term commercial viability of land and <span class="highlight">environment</span> conservation practices have been supported: demonstration catchment, Pisant Creek, South Australia demonstration project- pitting of denuded pastoral and marginal land, South Australia demonstration erosion and reclamation control project in cereal growing districts of Western Australia demonstration of a method of sand-trapping and dune rebuilding, Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This light capsules the spirit of strong yet gentle men and women who have lost their patience, who have suffered for what must seem to them an enternity and who are now putting into practice in this modern <span class="highlight">environment</span> the same sense of preservation, determination and survival demonstrated by their forebears who tamed the harsh dry areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we deal with urban matters, just as when we deal with environmental matters, we have to bear in mind that everything is connected to everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to the honourable member for Kingston, who seemed to be concerned about the fact that sewerage was a transport matter, that the second principle in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is that everything has to go somewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reports from the United States General Accounting Office last September, from a task force which reviewed nuclear waste management for the United States Department of Energy in February and from the United States Congress Sub-Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Energy and National Resources, have all reiterated in the strongest possible terms the absence of technical and regulatory procedures for satisfactorily dealing with high level radioactive waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first place it recognises the importance of fulfilling contracts and supplying energy; secondly, it protects the Australian community; thirdly, it protects the Aboriginal community and its sacred lands and other lands which need protection; and fourthly, it covers the need to protect and safeguard the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the area where the mining will take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ministerial statement and the Bills make it obvious that we will be following the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Fox in his report on the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though it took India 20 years to create the <span class="highlight">environment</span> within which it could explode a device, it has still, in its own circumstances, proceeded to announce that its plans are peaceful and not identifiable with potential military aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It protects the power of corporate secrecy and makes Aborigines impotent to challenge a company if it considers that disclosing its technical information might tend to incriminate it in regard to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reference was made by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  to the specific provisions that I have mentioned briefly relating to the provision of environmental information and also the inspection rights that the Northern Land Council will enjoy as a result of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we give rights to people to go in and to inspect other people’s records and activities and when we give them the right, as is to be given under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill which is part of this cognate debate to be able to go to the court to protect those rights, there is no doubt in my mind that provision must be made to ensure that information that might be gained but which perhaps is not relevant will not be divulged willy-nilly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill is designed to give effect to the Government’s decision accepting the recommendation of the second Fox report that legislative action be taken to enable the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council to enforce the environmental protection provisions, particularly by way of injunction, and to compel action and to give the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory a wide definition as to the exercise of its jurisdiction in such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is drafted on the basis that the court would be able to deal with the parties involved in a way in which one would expect- by fine, by failing to make orders or in other ways available to courts- to ensure that proceedings are not brought vexatiously but only genuinely, in the belief that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is in danger and in need of protection as a result of the mining activity and a breach of the provisions that had been specifically entered into by the parties involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a quote from the Fox report, but the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  was equally laudatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How is it possible, on the basis of the repeated statements by the Fox Commission that it simply does not know what will happen in the Magela Creek system if uranium mining goes ahead, that the Government could come to the conclusion that there would be adequate safeguards of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the proposed Kakadu National Park? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact I have just arranged to go there in the next few days as a member of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill 1978 is based on the recommendations contained in chapter 17 of the second Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report listed at page 294 the various destructive elements that could affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for which standards and procedures should be set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If something detrimental to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region is happening, it is important that it be known by the Parliament quickly and not hushed up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, we shall move that the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the Northern Land Council and the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council provide members of the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final Bill in this cognate debate, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978, has almost been aborted at its birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, what this Bill provides is codes of practice to govern nuclear activities in Australia with regard to the health and safety of people, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An earlier draft of the Bill, which we were successful in getting a copy of, provided that there would be an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Activities) Advisory Council, which would draft proposed codes for the Minister, who would then hold a public inquiry on the proposals and allow public comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned during the cognate debate at the second reading stage, the Supervising Scientist will not be able to let the members of the public know, through the Parliament, of his communications with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development during the period prior to the tabling of his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the recommendations should go to the Minister but it should be mandatory for him to place them before both Houses of Parliament, as it is under other legislation relating to <span class="highlight">environment</span> questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  mentioned that the Northern Land Council will be represented on the Committee, and I have no doubt that that commitment will be honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have suggested that the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the Northern Land Council, and the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council be specifically included in the Bill and represented on the Co-ordinating Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in his second reading speech the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  mentioned particularly the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, the Northern Territory Administration and the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think it is the sort of Australia-wide, allembracing <span class="highlight">environment</span> group which could reasonably be added to the list of groups which could be seen to have some sort of interest in this whole business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The three Bills which we are debating- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill 1978, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978- form a package of Bills now before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, taken together, they deal with the need to make an early start on the mining and development of our uranium resources, whilst at the same time ensuring adequate protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers Region, protection of the rights and legitimate interests of the Aborigines in the region, protection of the safety of persons engaged in the uranium industry, and the development of adequate safeguards to prevent proliferation of the nuclear armament industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Government for the content in particular of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister said when introducing the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which is designed to establish an office of a supervising scientist, a co-ordinating committee and a research institute for the region, it is the co-ordinating committee which will be the focal point of the system proposed by the Government for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of uranium mining operations in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I join in the debate on this group of Bills- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the three Bills are truly environmental and deal with different aspects, it seems to me that the content of the two groups I mentioned is somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think perhaps I should advert to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  commented that the Bill will enable governments to ensure that the nuclear industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to the people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first time I was in the area was as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which investigated wildlife conservation between 1 969 and 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a fairly sensitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> to any concentrated pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why can we not have representatives from, as he has put forward, the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council and similar bodies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could give an independent assessment of what may occur in this very uncertain area of environmental protection, the very area in which we are not sure of what will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill proposes substantial changes to the principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was understood by the Majority Leader from an agreement between the then Majority Leader,  Dr Goff  Letts, and the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Senator Greenwood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, in comparison with related Bills such as the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, clearly shows that there is a direct intrusion into local Northern Territory matters whereas the latter Bill largely equates the position of the Territory with that of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill envisages that the national Director will have a central role in the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in the enforcement of environmental controls, whether relating to uranium mining or not, in the area comprised in the national park or in any conservation zone, pending the extension of the national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has received numerous representations from those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  to consider accepting our proposed amendment in that spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for example, to the question of penalties for a supervising scientist who discloses a matter that he discovers in the course of his supervisory duties, which was dealt with in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It seems to me that this is an occasion on which it would be appropriate for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  to inform honourable members of the Government’s position, which seems to have changed since this Bill was introduced as a result of the reactions of the Premiers of the various States as communicated to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In previous correspondence the South Australian Government has pointed out a number of areas particularly in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of little wonder that the State governments are denouncing this package of legislation, particularly the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill abrogates responsibility for the actual administration of these Codes to the States, but it does not spell out how they should perform their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  as a distinguished lawyer, would be fully aware of that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, and it is the preparation of the codes provided for in that Bill that is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is called the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the view expressed first by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Cadman),  and more or less reiterated in part by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  that ideally there ought to be uniform codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join issue with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  in terms of his view that it is an appropriate form of consultation for the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to make a general statement in the House, then for legislation of this sort to be introduced in the way in which it has been introduced, with copies being supplied for the States, and then for the Government to move from that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also happens to be a fact that in my own State, whatever its imperfections, there is <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation on the statute book that goes further than anything the Government has contemplated in this legislation, and indeed further than any environmental Commonwealth statute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental protection codes operate in Victoria, and there is an administrative structure in that State that is tremendously well developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was merely pointing out that I believe that one of the main reasons why the States are concerned about this legislation is that what will ultimately happen to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a result of long term waste disposal in Australia has not been properly thought through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable member for Marybyrnong  (Dr Cass)-  I have not seen all the alternative codes and I have not seen the final Code proposed by the Government- when he said that the likelihood is that we will get better <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection nuclear codes from a Federal government than we will from individual State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shall cause to be furnished to the appropriate Minister of each State, and to the Minister for the time being administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and, on and after 1 July 1978, to the appropriate Minister for the Northern Territory and shall cause to be published in the  Gazette- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the time being administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 shall, within 1 month of being furnished with a proposed code of practice, make a direction under sub-section 11(1) of the Act that an inquiry be conducted in respect of the environmental aspects (if any) of the proposed code, and the provisions of the Act shall apply to that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the Minister for the time being administering the  <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act  1974 is furnished with a proposed code of practice or a proposed variation of a code and an inquiry is currently in progress under the Act in respect of a proposed code or variation, the Minister may direct that the first-mentioned proposed code or variation be referred to the Commission conducting the inquiry, and the provisions of the Act shall apply as if that Commission was appointed to consider that proposed code or variation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would like to see this brought out into the open and trade unions, environmental bodies and other groups given the opportunity to put something forward for inclusion in these codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These comments relate also to the next amendment through which the Opposition hopes to set up an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Activities) Advisory Council which will help in drafting codes of practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After sub-clause ( 1 ) insert the following sub-clause: (1a) The Governor-General shall not make an order under paragraph ( 1 ) (a) before the time at which the public inquiry to be held under sub-section 7(2) or 7(3) has reported its findings to the Minister for the time being administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The purpose of the amendment to clauses 11 and 13 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is to postpone the application of those clauses to the States until a date to be proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this proposal to defer and delay two important segments of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, namely clauses 1 1 and 13, makes a complete mockery of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom):  What will happen if there is a dispute as to the interpretation of those regulations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  we were told how necessary it was that this legislation be enacted but we are told now that we will have only part of the legislation; the rest is to be delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point again that in the interests of the Government, if this legislation were adopted, it would do away with the need for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill which is listed for debate later this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the laws of the Commonwealth (other than this section) and of that State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons likely to be affected by that situation, or for protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in so far as it is likely to be affected by that situation, he may, by order, authorise a Minister, during the period that the order remains in force, to give such directions and take such action as, subject to sub-section (2), the Minister considers necessary to control and eliminate hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Where a situation exists where the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is likely to be harmed by a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory and the laws of the Commonwealth (other than this section) and of the State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons likely to be affected by that situation or for protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in so far as it is likely to be affected by that situation, the GovernorGeneral may, by order, authorize a Minister, during the period that the order remains in force, to give such directions and take such action as, subject to sub-section (2), are strictly necessary to control and eliminate hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court would look at the real issues- which is what the clause set out to say- the health and safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no suggestion that we do not want to prevent hazards to the health and safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-An interpretive role on the basis of whether the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are likely to be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had defined those words very clearly, as the Opposition has done, setting out in detail the penalties and setting out what the court should look at, the objective test would be whether the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are likely to be harmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It is not the role of any government to do away with judicial interpretation and the opportunity to a citizen to go into the court and say- no honourable members opposite can object to this- ‘I am appearing in this court on the basis that there is no objection from the point of view of health and safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill there is very limited jurisdiction in which anybody can appear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been silenced by the Government Whip each time despite the historic nature of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill which was alluded to by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  when he introduced it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill as they are associated measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the House that the Opposition opposes the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill, for the reason that we proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill that would have created jurisdiction for a federal court in respect of the matters dealt with in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say also that any organisation shall be taken to have an interest if it is concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should have been amended to provide for the Federal Court to deal with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia in support of an application made by the Land Council under section 4 of the  <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Aci  1978; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is in the terms used in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, which was debated earlier today, to provide that the Houses of the Parliament will have an opportunity to disallow a proclamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia has jurisdiction, at the suit of the Director or of a Land Council, to make orders for or in relation to the enforcement, in relation to uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region, of any requirement of or having effect under a prescribed instrument, so far as the requirement relates to any matter affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In clause 3, after the definition of ‘requirement’ insert the following definition:  “Supervising Scientist” means the Supervising Scientist as defined in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978; ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In clause 4, after sub-clause ( 1 ) insert the following subclauses: ( 1a) An organisation of persons, whether incorporated or not, shall be taken to have interests that are affected by uranium mining operations in the Region if concern with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Region is a matter included in the objects or purposes of the organisation or association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>( 1b) Sub-section ( 1a) does not apply in relation to a particular happening, incident or transaction occurring as pan of uranium mining operations in the Region if the matter occurred before the organisation or association was formed or before the objects or purposes of the association included concern with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are also proposing that organisations which have as one of their objects concern with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be taken to have a standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major component of the review directed by the Government of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is concerned with the role of the Act in relation to State environmental responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Co-operative arrangements for the environmental assessment of proposals for which a State and the Commonwealth each have some responsibility have been made at ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ Minister level with Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will refer quickly to the abuses of the VIP flight: The wine flight; the strawberry flight; Fraser’s delight, the Opera House flight as the Sydney  Sun  described it; the Press conference flight for $3,000 for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to hold a Press conference; the trips to the tailor; and now the Government’s refusal to provide any information at all on the cost of overseas travel by Ministers of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another point which might be worth noting is that, quite apart from the fact that no policy stance has been taken on this matter at this stage, there is the added protection of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, which is very relevant to this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ultimately the most important objective to which Australia is contributing by this policy and by its parallel high level of activity on nuclear arms control issues is an international <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which no country could seriously contemplate the nuclear weapon option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  who is at the table is listening to the words of wisdom I have for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need confidence in this country in the economy and I would ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  who is at the table, to draw the attention of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  to a report which appeared last week in the  Australian Financial Review  that persons associated with both VAM Ltd and the so-called militant wing of the New South Wales Liberal Party are trying to take over the New South Wales Permanent Building Society, which has assets of $700m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears to me that it would be better if we could be positive by creating an <span class="highlight">environment</span> for economic development which by itself automatically would create more job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The leadership of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in a tough and desperate economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> has seen responsibility in government spending- the brake- and an increase in private investment, be it in business, in the home or on the farm, which is the accelerator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginals are opposed to mining at Jabiluka or Jabiru but because they feel they cannot stop the Government from going ahead with the mining project obviously these people have a right to try to negotiate and try to get some money as compensation for spoiling their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and their traditional way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is absolutely essential for the debate about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to be rational and free of the abuse and vitriol that has been evident in recent years, and for both environmentalists and the Government to assure workers that they will not be disadvantaged financially by any decision to cease the operations of the industry in which workers’ occupations are threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not closing the debate, of course, because the motion was moved by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the implications for the community, for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, for industry and for Government policy of developments in science and technology; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the oddities of our community at the present moment is that we are very careful of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to do anything to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we expend a great deal of care upon it, but I think the time has long passed since we gave serious consideration to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time- I think this is of major significance in the proposal- in the process of the argument or the discussion between scientists and with the politicians we will create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> whereby the politicians may in fact be educated and may better understand the potential significance of what the scientists are talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this point one must feel that the Government must be congratulated, as must be the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Newman,  when he was Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, made the original announcements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want an undertaking from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  that in tabling that report he will make a statement which will allow the House to debate the housing situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe also that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development should give us the right under clause 15 to debate this issue every year so that we can illustrate the shortcomings that exist in welfare housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a government which attempts to separate the whole question of housing from its planning, from its land and from its environmental context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a government which sees housing in abstraction, fundamentally, from those contexts, so it favours a form of housing in which it is possible for people to surround themselves with an appropriate <span class="highlight">environment</span> in terms of their own quarter acre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point of this legislation which the Opposition has refused to acknowledge, and which during the course of this debate, it has consistently contested, is that the legislation introduced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  in this session provides for the most flexible, the most logical and the most innovative approach to welfare housing that this Parliament has ever seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>I should like to make two comments on clause 20 for the benefit of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, among the objectives set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)-  a trivial speech which did not go into the policy objectives of the Government ip any detail whatsoever- there is not a single reference to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, how far do this Government’s economic policy and the housing policy of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  go towards achieving those objectives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has emphasised that he was being responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I accept your guidance,  Mr Deputy Chairman,  but in the whole question of nuclear relationships everything is interconnected and the whole purpose of the Supervising Scientists is to try to make the <span class="highlight">environment</span> a better place to live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that interrelated with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is the fact that the third recommendation of the Fox report was that the nuclear power industry and uranium mining was interrelated with the whole question of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and that in itself is a threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  who is sitting at the table, knows only too well people in that Commission have the experience and the ability to handle parks and wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, he did not mention the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, nor did he mention the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill which refers to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that some honourable members are interested in the conservation of wildlife in the Northern Territory otherwise they would not be speaking on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the convenience of the Committee I point out that amendments have been distributed covering three Bills, the first one of which is the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which we are now debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall deal with the views of the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  and also of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  that now these Bills have come back amended from the Senate, somehow everything will be all right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe for one moment that a Bill which is little better than a public relations exercise and which purports to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers Region will achieve that commendable objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, who is sitting at the table, that he had an opportunity to explain and to enlarge upon these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, which is so concerned about the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, takes the view that was put in the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would consider clearly that it was a job of considerable responsibility and would advertise throughout the world in order to get someone of eminence whose reputation both as a scientist and as one having concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is well known and publicly established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never met the gentleman concerned but I do not believe that the Government was genuine in its appointment of the supervising scientist, if the Government is saying that this man sees his role as protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as against the interests of the uranium miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that there are a couple of people who have been appointed to the supervising committee who will render a valuable service but I think if we are being honest about it we will say that what the honourable member was really concerned about was not that those persons would have any real regard for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but that they would have a slice of the cake, whether yellowcake or otherwise, from the profits that come from uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there has been a struggle within the bureaucracy; that the Department for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development in many cases lost out to those under the administration of the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony),  the growth sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the grave, unresolved problems relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the area concerned, the gentleman in question should never have been put in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to read the first and second reports of the inquiry to realise the grave, unresolved environmental problems that remain in the area, and the grave responsibility that the Supervising Scientist would have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My remarks are more by way of a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Land in the Northern Territory, other than land in the Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mt Olga) National Park or in the Alligator Rivers Region as defined by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978, shall not, without the consent of the Territory, be acquired by the Commonwealth for the purposes of this Part if it is land that is dedicated or reserved under a law of the Territory for purposes related to nature conservation or the protection of areas of historical, archeological or geological importance or the area having special significance in relation to Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not say that of the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are enough problems with regard to the clauses of this legislation, which honourable members have bypassed to some degree because some of the points were raised in connection with the previous legislation, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection ( Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has come into the House without any proper exposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one concerned for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, concerned for the Aborigines and concerned for the relevant government instrumentalities I indict the Minister as being ministerially responsible at least for the most inadequate legislation that has come into this Parliament for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  that when the original Bill was brought into the House it was passed with less than one and a half hours debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  is one of the very junior Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least, if the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  is going to tell the Committee the meaning of these provisions he ought to get it right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading sub-section 10 in the context of the object there, if the Territory or the State have reserved or dedicated land for those purposes, I respectfully agree with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  that it is npt unreasonable for the Commonwealth to say that it will not acquire land without first consulting the State or Territory and that it will acquire land only after it has the consent of the State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For older migrants, we will follow up the suggestion that greater support be given to those willing to care for their elderly relatives at home, and that institutions accommodating old people should specialise more in providing an <span class="highlight">environment</span> acceptable to ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole essence of the Government’s claims was that it would provide strong, tough codes of practice so that Australians- people who were working in  the mining industry, people who were living near mining operations, Aborigines and people who were in any way affected by the transportation of yellowcake- would be carefully covered so that both their health, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, would not be impaired in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a nice strong series of codes that we believe will protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the people of Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been a member of a State parliament for many years and perhaps I understand a bit more about the operations of State parliaments than the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and members on the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is not worried about nuclear codes or the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is absolutely typical of their philosophical stand on the uranium mining question, particularly in respect of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill that we are now debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August of last year the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  wrote to all the States and said that the Government was going to try to bring in uniform codes of <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection for uranium mining throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the economic welfare of our people, and the rights and well-being of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the absence of procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes to ensure that any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is eliminated, it is imperative that no commitment of Australia ‘s uranium deposits to the world’s nuclear fuel cycle should be made until: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand why the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  who is sitting at the table, did not choose to speak in bringing down these amendments because if one looks at his speech on 10 April, which is reported at page 1297 of  Hansard - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 11(1) states, in effect, that where the Governor-General says that the laws of a particular State or Territory are not adequate to provide for nuclear codes for <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection then the Governor-General- in other words the Commonwealth Governmentshould take the lead and should provide for the imposition of codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote from my own speech:  1 agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)-  when he said that the likelihood is that we will get better <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection nuclear codes from a Federal government than we will from individual State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened respectfully to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has greater concepts than this Committee had about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was so ravenous in its attempt to reap the profits of uranium it did not care whether the matter concerned Aboriginals, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the States or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under clause 13 the Government, where the provisions of nuclear codes did not cover adequately what we would like to cover- the health of the people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- could move in and virtually take control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  said, in answering a previous question- and I assume he will use exactly the same argument here- that under the Constitution extra powers are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with the health and safety of people, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that nuclear material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply refer to clause 13 to remind the honourable member for Robertson that the right of the Governor-General only accrues when he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory, and where there is not already legislation enacted to cover the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Opposition say that the Minister has backed down and been stood over, firstly, by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, and secondly, he has been stood over by the States with regard to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be no valid reason for opposing the proposition that has been put by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  because under the amendments the legislation will allow the State governments a proper exercise of some of their capacities for the protection of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this last amendment we are dealing with the question of the health or safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Governor-General thinks that they may be harmed due to some nuclear activity and if he thinks that the laws of the Commonwealth, other than as provided in this clause, and the laws of the State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, under the original legislation he could require certain regulations, but under this amendment the States will be allowed to slip out from under. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, every supporter of the Government, including the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  voted for the legislation in its original form which was one of the most centralist pieces of legislation ever to come through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is all right for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to be pro-Aborigine, if it is all right for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to be pro-environmentalists, if it is all right for the Department of Industry and Commerce to be in favour of industry and commerce, if it is all right for the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to be pro-business and consumer affairs and for the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to be pro-veteran what is wrong with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations being pro-labour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is one of carefully regulated and controlled development having full regard to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of those resources, while serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of the Aboriginal people, and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few months ago  Mr Landa,  the Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, went out of his way, and apparently got some delight out of doing it, to close down north coast mining in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  as  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has summed up the various aspects that we dealt with and the recommendations we have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The particular area we looked at, the effect of Commonwealth Government decisions on the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, would be of interest to most members of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What became obvious in the inquiry were the major changes in the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, with the location of buildings, the people working in those buildings, their modes of transport and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we use the term ‘ <span class="highlight">environment</span> ‘ we tend to get stuck on the green aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> instead of thinking of all the other social and economic factors in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the question of population growth, especially in relation to the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, one could argue that it should not be under a special population department but should be part of either the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development or a department with a similar influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Interrelated with this is the fact that, in dealing with the private sector, the Australian Government has an enormous influence in deciding where private investment will be made in relation to the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope to prove that if the States are to maintain the standards that they have set and to catch up with the backlog of capital works, particularly those concerning urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it will be necessary for them to increase the taxes they impose, because they have been starved of funds by the Federal Government, particularly over the last two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This afternoon the honourable member for Petrie presented a report on behalf of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which had looked into the matter of urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its report the Committee deals with the interrelationship between the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the necessity to maintain services; with the need to inter-relate services if we are to have a better urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government tried to work in cooperation with the States, try to reach an understanding so that the States could improve the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and State infrastructure to bring them to a higher standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It really originated in March 1977, when  Mr David  Cameron, a research forester with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, based in Darwin, made certain allegations during an in camera hearing of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee of the House concerning the management and viability of the government forestry program in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  says that this cut will be counteracted by State income from sales and rents and by a reduction of 5 per cent in the proportion of savings bank deposits required to be held by the Reserve Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In present circumstances, achieving an appropriately restraining overall domestic policy <span class="highlight">environment</span> without putting stress on the balance of payments, and on domestic interest rates, requires a balanced mix of policy in which the budget deficit is held under tight rein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is moving so harshly and so quickly to bring about such a massive shift in resources from the people to the corporate sector that it is posing a very serious threat to the stability of the Australian society and, therefore, to the stability of the Australian economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 and 2.2 of those procedures, information from the proponents of the Alwest bauxite mining project in Western Australia sufficient to consider the necessity of an environmental impact statement in relation to the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the report on Nuclear Power Costs prepared by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Energy and Natural Resources Sub-Committee of the United States House Government Operations Committee which stated that radio-active waste is a significant and growing problem with at least 3,000 metric tonnes of spent nuclear fuel now being stored at commercial reactor sites and an additional 17,000 metric tonnes expected to accumulate in the next decade, and that there is still no demonstrated technology for permanently and safely disposing of this waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-47-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the advice of the Vehicle Emissions and Noise Advisory Committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council been sought in relation to the Government’s proposal that lead levels in petrol sold in Australia should not be further reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-39-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development whether his attention has been drawn to the announcement by the Queensland State Government Insurance Office Building Society of a reduction of one half of one per cent on interest rates for new homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence of that situation is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has circulated a letter to the unfortunate applicants who have been advised of the delay, suggesting that they could make arrangements with banks to use their letter of advice to get bridging finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The question that should be asked of the House and of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  is this: Does the building industry need a stimulus? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This has been followed up and that environmental clearance has been re-endorsed by the Department at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that wives and families were omitted would certainly, in the current <span class="highlight">environment</span>, become a point for criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, and the State Ministers responsible for youth, sport and recreation, appeal to sportsmen and sportswomen throughout Australia not to lend their names and prestige to the promotion of tobacco products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would be more of an employment creating effect if $ 10m was spent in the area of the Minister at the table, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  who is responsible for the building and construction industry, than if that same $10m was spent to buy another piece of defence equipment from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should we maintain a standing committee system which has a few standing committees in specific areas such as <span class="highlight">environment</span>, or should we look at the possibility of subject matter committee which can deal with a variety of subjects in a variety of areas and which can take note of the resources of the House in terms of numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following action has been taken in accordance with the Administrative Procedures under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act before Thursday, 17 August 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development received representations from groups in Western Australia who are concerned at the proposal by Alcoa of Australia Ltd to mine bauxite at Wagerup and who are seeking a public inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these proposals come within the Commonwealth legislation and the Commonwealth officers of my Department are working very closely in association with the Western Australian officers to determine what impact these proposals might have on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not one of the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee members will now be required to have qualifications in a marine science or for that matter in any of the environmental sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We believe it is important that the  Chairman  should be required at least to be qualified in the environmental sciences, and we intend to move an amendment to that effect in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will get rid of the problem of rigidity that now applies but at the same time it will ensure that the  Chairman  of the Authority is a man who has shown an interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and has studied and qualified in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In 1974, this Parliament passed a most far reaching and thoughtful piece of legislation, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then the British Prime Minister, I believe with great courage in his <span class="highlight">environment</span>, made it perfectly plain that since there was no wage restraint and since the fight against inflation was of paramount importance for his Government and, in the judgment of his Government, for the people of Britain, he would therefore have to take consequential action on fiscal and monetary policy to compensate for the fact that there would be less restraint in the wages area than he and the Government of Britain had sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the end it will be shown to have brought together the vital interests- all of which are national interests in their own right- of those people who are concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the interests of the Aboriginal people and those people who are concerned to see desirable national development through the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to take up a number of items of the Budget under the appropriations for the Department of National Development and the Department of Trade and Resources and to allude to several items under the appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development because they are relevant to the first items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also quite clear that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has tried with commendable concern to rationalise its staff, through a period of savage cuts, in such a way as would allow it to maintain intact those functions which it has been given to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clearly a misnomer to describe the Department as the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development because the environmental and community development responsibilities of the Department, while remaining on paper, cannot possibly be performed on the scale and at the depth originally envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sum them up in this way: These departments, under this Government’s guidance, continue to espouse- and the Estimates reflect this-that business stability resulting from the fight against inflation will create the <span class="highlight">environment</span> necessary for creating jobs and reducing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All these problems, all this irrationality, cannot be blamed on the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  and on this Government, but it has in the main been Liberal governments in Canberra and in Victoria which have lacked the concern and interest and the will to seek to impose order on the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sad situation is that it has a very low priority from this Government, and I am not casting any reflection on the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  when 1 say that he is one of the junior Ministers in a Ministry of 27. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The area improvement programs have been eliminated completely and the expenditure on land commissions has been cut by nearly 80 per cent, on other urban development by nearly 80 per cent, on the development of Aboriginal community amenities by 9 1 per cent, on protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by nearly 40 per cent, and on sewerage and garbage assistance by 8 1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one considers this matter as a percentage of Budget outlays, in 1975-76 allocations to the Department of Urban and Regional Development and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation represented 7.4 per cent of Budget outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 26 September 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 26 September 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the decisions made about two years ago were based upon an appreciation of a stringent financial <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My friend the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, who is at the table, mentioned the north-west coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I present the report of the Committee entitled ‘Oil Spills: Prevention and Control of Oil Pollution in the Marine <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’, together with the transcript of evidence and extracts from the minutes of proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The report just tabled is the second report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation established in the 3 1st Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pollution arising from such sources releases, on a world-wide basis, over 2 million metric tonnes of oil into the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of pollution of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> by oil is, unfortunately, already common in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is not well prepared to cope with a major pollution incident, yet ship-sourced oil pollution, accidental or deliberate, is already a major environmental problem and the Committee believes that as Australia’s reliance on imported oil products increases so will the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Authorities must carefully assess the environmental implications before allowing such vessels to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental impact of marine oil pollution is difficult to predict not only because our knowledge of marine ecology is imperfect but also because there are no effective means of evaluating the physical factors which affect an oil spill such as tidal and wind movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence suggests there is little information available on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well established that major oil spills have a disastrous effect on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the effect merely involves the dispersal of the oil as rapidly as possible without consideration of the additional environmental damage involved in the wholesale application of toxic dispersants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee believes that environmental authorities must be given the opportunity to become more closely involved in the monitoring and clean-up of small routine oil spills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for expanded research programs into marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> and ecology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the program would be to encourage research in all States and develop a comprehensive body of data on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I echo briefly the comments of the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges),  in relation to the staff of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my point of view it was a very interesting inquiry in the sense that it was the first one in which I have participated and in many respects it illustrated some of the problems associated with environmental protection within modern highly industralised societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another issue that arose and which is typical in the environmental area is that the solution to or the means of dealing with a problem creates an even more serious problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  to recommendation 12 of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in relation to oil spills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I too welcome the tabling of this report in the Parliament this afternoon by the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surreptitiously and deceitfully, the Fraser Government is washing its hands of any responsibility for the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On taking office in 1975, the Prime Minister showed his total lack of concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by placing the portfolio in the hands of a man who was a raw novice in politics, the present Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  performance was pathetic enough as he watched his Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development being dismantled before his very eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The millions of Australians concerned that this country could become a hole in the ground through the efforts of environmental gangsters like Lang Hancock were momentarily tricked into believing that the Fraser Government had some concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by its decision to end sand mining on Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> during the previous two years was rewarded by his being appointed Minister for National Development- in other words, the spokesman for the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his place the man least likely to stand up to the bullying tactics of the Prime Minister was appointed to oversee the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another Tasmanian had to be appointed to the Ministry and, faced with the unpalatable option of  Senator Rae,  who has a lot of ability but is disliked by the Prime Minister, and the ratbag rump of dissidents who make up the rest of Tasmania’s representatives, the Prime Minister chose the affable but ineffectual member for Braddon  (Mr Groom)  as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this was small fry compared with what was to happen in the future as the Government planned the destruction of Kakadu National Park through uranium mining and the abdication of any responsibility for Perth’s water supply, Western Australia ‘s famed jarrah forests, the Corio Bay fish habitat reserve near Yeppoon, the Great Barrier Reef and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, which was the only bastion left to protect <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the ravages of the ecological piranhas that care not one whit for Australia ‘s heritage if they can see a profit in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has suffered the most severe cutbacks of all departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government currently is trying to opt out of its responsibilities under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act was introduced by the Labor Government in December 1974 in response to a record of indifference by previous governments, State and Federal, to environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act was hailed as the most important piece of legislation concerned with the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to come before the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only in the case of Fraser Island has a venture actually stopped under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has increased <span class="highlight">environment</span> consciousness among companies presenting proposals to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1975, the Liberal-National Country Party spokesman on <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation, the present Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  stated: ‘We will continue to support the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see where the pressure is coming from when we read the pamphlet produced recently by the Australian Mining Industry Council and urging the Government to hand control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> back to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have the prime responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and it was because of the irresponsible attitude of Premiers Court and Bjelke-Petersen that the Australian Government found it necessary to enact legislation which used its powers in foreign trade and investment to prevent their worst excesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government will sidestep its national and moral responsibilities for the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20 March, in a letter to the New South Wales Premier, the Prime Minister raised the question of a statutory framework for intergovernmental legislative arrangements for environmental assessment to cover on-shore and off-shore proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Details were sought from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development by the New South Wales Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland has said that it will not sign any agreement with the Commonwealth because it opposes what it calls Federal interference’ in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know only too well the record of these two governments in <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Virtually every Australian would shudder at the thought of areas of national environmental significance such as the Great Barrier Reef, Fraser Island and the world’s only jarrah forest being left to the whims of these State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such representative <span class="highlight">environment</span> areas are a national resource, not simply a State resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few better examples of this Government’s and this Minister’s craven fear of the States and this Government’s total lack of concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> than its refusal to take any action whatsoever over the Iwasaki Sangyo company’s proposal to build a major tourist development at Yeppoon in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a perfect example of where the Australian Government, and the Minister in particular, could have used the power of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation to force some changes to the project that would have made only marginal difference to the concept itself but would have minimised risk to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Corio Bay area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of rubbish has been talked about the Iwasaki proposals and has clouded the real issues of environmental concern, civil liberties and the Australian national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition to the project has ranged from genuine criticisms in respect of the dangers to the local <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the possible infringement of civil liberties and the reasonable demand that projects of this nature should have some Australian equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document was a report on the draft environmental impact statement on the resort and was signed by  Mr H.  Higgs, Director of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of the International Village and Marine Park proposals, elements of the built <span class="highlight">environment</span> do not directly affect the wetlands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing this the <span class="highlight">environment</span> would have been protected a great deal more than it is presently being protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would see an environmental fight the like of which has not been seen in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government is abrogating its responsibilities for environmental matters and the last vestiges of what could be called a national <span class="highlight">environment</span> policy is being dissipated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its attitude is causing great concern to the majority of genuine people who have an interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, conservation and quality of life issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Government which has shown blatant contempt for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and consistently yielded to vested interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mouth platitudes about its concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> when politically expedient, but one can be assured in these instances that its interests lie elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly pleasing to hear the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  at last speak on an environmental issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since he has had the job he has been almost totally silent on environmental issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I welcome this opportunity to say a few words about the things the Government is doing in the area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation and to explain to the House some of the actions that have been taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, as a government, we are showing real concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and we have acted sensibly and responsibly to protect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has developed a comprehensive framework within which its policies and programs are being refined to protect and enhance the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> does not rest only in the hands of the Federal Government, as the honourable member implied in some of the comments he made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was interesting that the honourable member raised the general issue of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s basic approach is to co-operate with the other spheres of government in improving environmental protection while, at the same time, striking a proper balance between conservation and economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental protection is only one of a number of human values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not the captive of any interest group, whether it be any kind of commercial lobby or a group of radical environmentalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is proud of its record in the field of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepted the recommendations of the Fraser Island environmental inquiry and decisions have been taken since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage, I do not want to go into that issue in great detail because it is well known to those people who have an interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act, The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Act and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that legislation, stringent environmental controls will be imposed on uranium mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have continued to apply the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the operation of the Act, they are very much more aware of the need to be concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have negotiated draft agreements with four States on arrangements which are mutually acceptable for assessing the environmental impact of projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a move among the States, which I think has resulted from the Federal legislation, to have appropriate legislation or procedures so that they can assess properly and adequately projects to determine the impact those projects might have on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member mentions the environmental impact statement on the Iwasaki project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are members opposite like the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Humphreys),  who I think it is fair to say, are totally opposed to development and totally concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of work has been done by a number of officers on that project to assess carefully its impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, again, very strict conditions have been imposed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these conditions would satisfy any one with a genuine realistic interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to broad responsibilities for pollution abatement and the assessment of the state of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Government has sought to establish consistent nationwide approaches through the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council and the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have supported other research activities including the ecological survey of Australia and the assessment of the environmental consequences of specific energy decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have continued to support international environmental activities through the United Nations <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Program (UNEP), the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and regional bodies such as the Economic and Social Commission for the Pacific (ESCAP) and specialist meetings such as the United Nations Conference on Desertification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we certainly remain extremely active in fulfilling our responsibilities in the area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth noting that, in this financial year, there is an increase in the allocation for those areas of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the Federal Government is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot say that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is all important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> I think should be seen in a broader sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is being administered effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proponents of projects are very much conscious of the need to show concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remain very conscious of our responsibilities and we are administering the programs in this area very effectively with proper concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The not insignificant sum of $3 16m is to be allocated for direct advances for housing to the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will be aware, an inquiry under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 was established on 16 July 1975 to inquire into the development by the Atomic Energy Commission in association with Ranger uranium mines of uranium deposits in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the inquiry under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act the present Government, during consideration of the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill in 1976, introduced an amendment expressly authorising the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry to investigate and make a finding in relation to an Aboriginal land claim in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through an amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, the Northern Land Council has been given standing in the Northern Territory Supreme Court to seek an injunction against the mining operators should it feel that environmental conditions are not being observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been given rights of inspection of operations and documents and is entitled to information so that it may assess whether environmental conditions are being rigidly enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is very important and a major concession to Aboriginal interests as they themselves will have the means to be satisfied that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection measures are being observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now take this opportunity to inform honourable members of the progress that has been made in respect to other aspects of the Government’s environmental policies for the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in its uranium statements of August 1977, the Government promised to adopt strict environmental controls and standards in relation to uranium mining in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agreed to establish institutions and programs for the specific purpose of protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then considerable progress has been made and, in fact, the legal and administrative regime for environmental control of mining is now substantially in place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act was assented to in June of this year and an acting appointment to the office of the Supervising Scientist was made shortly afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environment</span> inquiry referred to the considerable amount of research that was needed before precise standards should be imposed on the various control aspects of the mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Ranger mine will not be operational for possibly three years, there is time to develop proper standards for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and these will be applied progressively as the basic information is obtained and interpreted by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Supervising Scientist will be required to maintain an overall supervision of the effects of uranium mining on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there are some aspects of <span class="highlight">environment</span> control that will be the direct responsibility of the Supervising Scientist, including the very important matter of disposal of tailings from the mining and milling operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All reports from the Supervising Scientist are to be tabled in Parliament so there will be the opportunity for Parliament itself to be kept fully informed on developments in respect to <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I remind the House of the provision that is made through the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Act for the Northern Land Council, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission to apply to the Supreme Court for orders in relation to protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sees this arrangement as providing an opportunity for these three organisations to reinforce the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection machinery in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While some features of the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  have some attractions, we said in great detail what we had to say when the various Bills, including the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, were debated in May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection will be considerably better in Kakadu than it was in the previous experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This happens to be the seat of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the honourable member for Braddon  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed that the honourable member for Adelaide should have entered on that same cart and tried to do exactly the same thing, namely, to discredit the good Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  who has worked so hard for this legislation, nicely and quietly behind the scenes, trying to do the right thing for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, because he is a Minister, has been unable to defend what he realises is in the best interests of the people of Queenstown, but he has won through by adopting a nice calm attitude- quite different from me, but that is good- and he will be admired for that in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the assistance is for an area in the electorate of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  we do not consider it to be pork barrelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a copy of the minute paper of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on youth crisis accommodation in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government adopted or does it intend to adopt the United States <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Agency Standards promulgated in 1977 relating to the exposure of members of the public to radiation in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the normal operation of the nuclear power cycle; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to inform honourable members of action the Government has taken in response to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> report on annual reports referred to the Committee dated 1 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Cities Commission Report fell due at a time when the department concerned, now the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, was undergoing extensive reorganisation; and the preparation of the report was overshadowed by tasks of greater priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Report of Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>- Ministerial Statement, 14 November 1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It outlines the Government’s response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on annual reports dated 1 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there is the Government’s response to the inquiry’s tentative suggestion that research for Australian community interests should not exclude work in support of improved quality of life in areas such as <span class="highlight">environment</span>, conservation and consumer services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CSIRO is well regarded for what relatively little environmental research it currently performs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Especially those of us who are often worried by the shrill prophecies of gloom from some of the environmentalists, such as the obviously biased Australian Conservation Foundation, would appreciate some scientific and hopefully unbiased comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program has been carefully designed to teach skills within a supportive <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which full account is taken of the need to work through the often serious problems of the young people, as well as ensuring effective working relationships with the local technical schools and employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it was that kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the Labor Party was not interested and which it could not achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Staley)  and the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)-  that is Killen of Cunnamulla and the Condamine- at the table for the Government and now we have the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not often commend any of the Ministers, but I would like the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, to convey to his friend and colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  my congratulations for the cuts that have been made to the grants for the Australian Conservation Foundation in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development made two important points in a recent news release. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Investigations by my Department have failed to bring to light the evidence attributed to the United States <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Agency which, it was alleged, established a statistical relationship between the use of 2,4,5-T and human birth defects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-42-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was announced at the same time that the Government had accepted specific recommendations of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry relating to the operation of the Ranger mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-42-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are actions yet to be completed, including the submission and examination of a final environmental impact statement (in accordance with the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Administrative Procedures) on the development of the Nabarlek uranium deposit, before a decision can be taken by the Government on whether, and on what terms and conditions, mining of the Nabarlek deposit may take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-42-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It demonstrates more clearly that the Fraser Government does not care a damn about the very serious hazards associated with uranium mining, the lifestyle of the Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land or the delicate <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, it becomes clear in the future that the environmental restrictions imposed on the Ranger operation by virtue of its authority to mine are too weak, then this legislation would prevent the Government of the day from updating the conditions attached to rnining, despite that newly acquired knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">environment</span> is damaged to an unexpected extent or in an unforseen way by uranium mining at Ranger then the Commonwealth would be powerless to improve the relevant <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection conditions laid down in association with the authority to mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is irresponsible that regardless of the findings of scientific studies of the consequences of mining on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the uranium province no stricter safety measures could be imposed under the Atomic Energy Act as amended by the Bill before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite plainly honourable members will understand that if we are talking about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Reef but not the Reef itself we have to ask the question: Where does it begin; where does it end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However it ought to be said, I think, and I am glad that the honourable gentleman drew it to my attention, that this Government’s support for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is unparalleled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles of the Heritage Commission are of great importance to Australia and this Government will maintain those principles to the fullest; but at the same time there are some elements of the Heritage Commission Act, as originally passed, which do come into conflict with other Acts and which could even stand in the way of matters which have been under full environmental examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there was a possibility of one point of conflict as a result of the Heritage Commission Act involving matters that had been the subject of  Mr Justice  Fox’s environmental reports and it does not seem to make much sense to have the possibility of conflict of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 would remind the House that, when announcing on 25 August 1977 its decision to proceed with uranium mining at Ranger, the Government indicated that further uranium mining projects in the Alligator Rivers Region would only proceed when the Government was fully satisfied as to the acceptability of the impact of the development on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Aboriginal people, having regard for the region as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the legislative controls which we introduced in April 1978 regulating uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, in conjunction with the environmental requirements which will be imposed on the company, together with the controls negotiated and agreed between the Northern Land Council and Queensland Mines Ltd, will ensure that any adverse impact on the local Aboriginal population will be minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the matters of grave concern mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week, especially the events in the Middle East and South East Asia and the general pattern of strategic instability, with Europe concentrating on its own interests and the United States playing a less active role in the general strategic and political <span class="highlight">environment</span>, Austrafia must look to its own situation with renewed honesty and perception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like him, I stress that one of the major glaring deficiencies in the field of Aboriginal health is the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>- so much so that, as the  Chairman  pointed out, the figures collected in Western Australia indicate that the incidence of conditions related to the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> treated in hospital is eight times higher for Aborigines than for non-Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me explain what is meant by the term ‘physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is also now wide acceptance that authorities involved in urban planning and development have a responsibility to preserve important elements of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> not only for their own sake but also as an essential element in the future urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> for a variety of recreational and educational purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, on notice, on 28 February 1 979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this particular matter one thing that I would like to express is the surprise at the general lack of interest in this type of environmental subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that concern for environmental matters is well down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the House to the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation of May 1975 on the operation of Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find some comments there that indicate that all forms of development are being questioned as to their environmental effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee at that time indicated that the financial assistance given to Tasmania on the forestry program should include provision for more emphasis to the purchase of marginal land and to the regeneration of hardwood forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take on further the report of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee we seem to accept that our timber resources are large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disturbed at this loss of environmental interest, particularly in the forest area which cover such a wide scope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation found that the forestry and timber industries were important elements in the decentralisation process and were substantial employers of manpower in rural areas where employment opportunities were limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over long periods of evolutionary time, a subtle balance has been achieved between the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the producers, consumers, and decomposers in these natural ecosystems . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it will contribute to the long term industrial development of Tasmania as well as enhance the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major investigations to which I have referred resulted in reports from the National Estate Committee of Inquiry which my friend, the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  initiated, the Forestry and Wood-based Industries Development Conference, the Working Group on Rural Policy- these three documents were produced in 1974- and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising from the report of the House of Representatives Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, of which I was a member, the Government took up the recommendation that a body such as the Bureau of Agricultural Economics should determine the economic viability of the softwood planting program both on strict financial grounds and on the broadest possible cost benefit grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember that when I was a kid the only emphasis on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the world around us that we got in school was perhaps on two days a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether it is a fact that the Government is in the process of reviewing each of the existing Commonwealth Acts covering environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the intention of the Government, following the completion of these secret reviews, to instruct the Minister to introduce amending legislation to each of the Commonwealth environmental protection Acts with the intention of weakening the existing legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the Government chosen to ignore the current investigations and hearings into environmental legislation and administration being carried out by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no secret that the Government has for some time been reviewing the principal environmental protection legislation in order to spell out properly the role of the States in supervising the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Australia, to ensure that overlapping and possible duplication of effort is avoided so that expense incurred by companies and people involved is kept to a minimum and io make the Act generally more efficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development I mentioned on a number of occasions, in public announcements and speeches, that this revision and review was being carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that context the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to which the honourable member referred has the opportunity and the right to comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subject to our giving priority to capabilities needed for operations in our own <span class="highlight">environment</span>, our defence force should also provide the Government of the day with the practical option of contributing to Pacific defence in accordance with the ANZUS Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The size and shape and equipment of our Defence Force should be assessed in Australia’s own geopolitical <span class="highlight">environment</span>- and this for three reasons: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s isolation from other continents, and our physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> of sea and air space and archipelagic territories, carry a number of pointers for our defence capabilities; as do the physical characteristics of our own continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in respect of armed threats within our own geographic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that our allies could be expected to look to Australia to be reasonably self-reliant, and to make a maximum effort to look after its own security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A little later, the administration of this protective legislation is to become the responsibility of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask for leave to have incorporated in Hansard that section of the oil spills report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which deals with effects of oil in the marine environmentparagraphs 1 8 to 2 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basis of environmental concern is so ill-defined, that it is not surprising that research scientists have reached widely differing conclusions about the dangers of oil pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite plainly honourable members will understand that if we are talking about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Reef but not the Reef itself we have to ask the question: Where does it begin; where does it end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  said this today, following earlier reports by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  that there would be no drilling on the Reef itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are discussing is not whether the island is to be more closely integrated into or to become a more remote part of the Australian scene, but how we can preserve the rights of the people of Norfolk Island, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Norfolk Island and the security of Norfolk Island and still retain it as part of the Australian scene with the advantages which that bestows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the outset, however, I must emphasise that the Commonwealth Government is committed to protect the health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, all governmentsState, Territory and Commonwealth- must also, in the national interest, have regard to the effects of proposed measures, not only on health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also on impacts on the consumer, industry, resources and the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In developing a framework for future action, it is clear that a number of steps must be taken to improve the implementation, administration and durability of emission control systems in the context of realistic health, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, transport and energy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ATAC and Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council should be in a position, at their early 1 98 1 meetings, to consider requirements for 1985 standards and the development of a new vehicle emission rule to implement such standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be added to that observation is the information provided by this Government’s own body, the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, in January last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One question was directed to the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  in this House and the other was directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Groom)  and the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> are pressing for the proclamation of the Capricornia section of the Marine Park off Rockhampton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate, however, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> denied this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the evidence available it seems to me that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is the man who is wrong and who is misleading this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate on 3 May the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a letter from the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  dated 22 January this year to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough to have the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> wilfully misleading the Parliament in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> knew that full well on 22 January 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, no matter how well motivated he might be in the issue of conservation, is misleading the Parliament and the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourthly, the creation of a protected zone for the preservation of the unique <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Strait area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to emphasise that the provisions of the Treaty to a very large extent incorporate recommendations made by the Committee in its earlier report on the Torres Strait boundary, namely that the Torres Strait Islands should remain part of Australia; that freedom of passage for Australians and Papua New Guineans should be guaranteed in the Protected Zone; that mining and drilling in the seabed should be prohibited until agreement is reached between all interested parties; and that new commercial ventures should not be permitted in the area unless they are compatible with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The basic concept of the Defence Force Academy was to replace the degree stream component of the Royal Military College, the Royal Australian Air Force Academy, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and Darling Downs Institute, and the Royal Australian Navy College with a single academy that would provide a balanced and liberal university education in a military <span class="highlight">environment</span> for officer cadets of the three Australian services, concurrently with a program of professional military training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee agreed that there is a need for a greater proportion of tertiary educated officers in the Defence Force and that cadets should be involved in a military <span class="highlight">environment</span> as much as possible during their tertiary studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the oil burning furnaces that produce energy in certain parts of the world and the coal burning furnaces that produce it in others, including this country, have their problems in relation to pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and other matters which people do not like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has been undertaking this program for several weeks now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bear this in mind: When Ministers mislead this Parliament and when they do so patently, apparently, intentionally, as the Minister for National Development and the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> have done, they are in fact imposing on the Australian public the greatest offence imaginable coming from this institution because it is the Australian public they are seeking to deceive- just as the Prime Minister has sought to deceive the Australian public with his statements about concern for the preservation of the Barrier Reef ecosystem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems he has defective hearing at the top end, as it were, or maybe it takes that long for arm twisting from the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  to work because it is quite clear that in this matter the Minister for Primary Industry was keen to preserve the ministerial position of one of his colleagues, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those two matters, but more especially the first, are quite distinctly different explanations by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in the Senate as to why there has been a delay in the proclamation of this Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the Minister for National Development was asked his question, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was asked the same question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had nothing at all to do with the overlapping of boundaries and the conflict which arose from the self-interest of the oil development companies represented by the Minister for National Development with the support of the Prime Minister and encouraged by the Queensland Government, as against the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> or the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Groom),  both of whom have argued that the area ought to be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Hansard  on 5 April, a letter from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to the Minister for National Development reports that the subject of areas over which it is proposed to renew permits ‘is an important topic of conservation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has argued consistently that there is no proposal before the Government to renew permits, yet here we have a letter from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to the Minister for National Development in which that very point is conceded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believing that the veil of departmental confidentiality on such correspondence matters will preserve the dishonesty in this matter, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> embarked upon what can only be described as a campaign to lie and mislead the Senate, the Parliament and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sought to explain away the obvious conflict between the statement that he made at Question Time and the statement made by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement he made, the Minister for National Development remained consistent in what he had said in correspondence with the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, namely, that there had to be a delay, that progress could not be made in the declaration of a marine national park off Rockhampton- the Capricornia one- until the matter of overlapping boundaries was cleared up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as it is dishonest for the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to say that it is purely a matter of constitutional difficulties, it is dishonest also for the Minister for National Development- who, in his first answer at least was honest in the sense of being consistent with what he said before- to come here and say that the answer in the Senate was entirely accurate, when he had been arguing quite the contrary four hours earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the very same moment, the same question was asked in another place of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only after it had been discovered that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in another place had given a totally different answer was there hurried consultation with the Prime Minister to work out, after the debacle of the last few weeks with the horror Budget and all that had been going on there, how he was going to save himself from another bad week by being forced to sack another Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They passed some laws about conservation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reputation of Australia stands second to none around the world following all the environmental and conservation decisions that this Government has taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is instrumental and important if we are to be able to undertake necessary research to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> on-shore and off-shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To suggest that this Government has no concern for environmental issues and to suggest that it has not acted with strength and vigour in these issues is ludicrous in the extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion, I indicated that AMSTAC- the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee- had been asked by the Government to submit advice to the Government on a program of research on the reef <span class="highlight">environment</span> for consideration in the Budget context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 4 April this year, I wrote to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  and suggested that the Minister might present a submission to AMSTAC on a possible program of research into the ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard this matter with the utmost alarm and I am prepared to table the paper for the benefit of the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Groom)  who represents the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  who I have not had the time to contact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- On 24 February 1977 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation decided to conduct an inquiry into and report on: ‘The adequacy of arrangements to prevent and deal with oil spills in Australian waters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main government submissions were provided by the Department of Transport and what is now the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time when the report was tabled, the Department of Transport and the Departments of Education and Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> had already put into action eight of the recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the ones dealing with tanker safety training; reporting of suspect shipping; official register of suspect shipping; encouragement to States to bring their legislation up to date; national plan equipment; involvement of environmental officers in incidents; register of oil cargo and spill information; and monitoring of international developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now table this statement to which is attached the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on oil spills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The response from the Government to the recommendations of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the prevention and control of oil pollution in the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> has taken some nine months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume from the remarks of the Minister for Productivity  (Mr Macphee)  that the response is made not only on behalf of the Department of Transport but also on behalf of the Department of Defence, the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the references to the faulty navigation charts which the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation found, I impress upon the Government that adequate funds should be made available for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential, if we are to protect our own marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, that there be some sort of efficient means of identifying the source of the pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned this to my colleague, the shadow Minister for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in respect of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was dealt with by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, in passing, because it was primarily concerned with oil spills from ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing that needs to be noted by the Australian people, I believe, is that oil spills are very damaging to the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the report itself which is entitled Oil Spills: Prevention and Control of Oil Pollution in the Marine <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Major oil spills have a clear and obvious deleterious effect on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on the communities of plants and animals living there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not easy to measure objectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of environmental concern is so ill-defined, that it is not surprising that research scientists have reached widely differing conclusions about the dangers of oil pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government had regard for all views, including those of the Northern Territory, during the framing of the Bills and the passing  of  the Acts relating to mining development, the establishment of townships, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Budget the Government has also recognised the need for industry to be highly innovative and technologically advanced if it is to compete effectively in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will require our industries to adopt new attitudes toward change and competition, to look increasingly beyond the limited <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Australian market and gradually come to rely less on government support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate we have provided for reductions to be phased in so that industry has time to adapt to operating in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of lower levels of protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead we are living in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the most contractionary, recessionary, depression-making Budget that this country has had to withstand for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, I draw the attention of the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon),  as honourable members from both sides of the House have done, to the importance of the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on oil pollution and the critical importance of that issue to Australia with particular reference to the Great Barrier Reef” and Torres Strait areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that the monetary and fiscal <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be taut, bearing down on inflation, but not contractionary as alleged by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that I have written to the Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in New South Wales, who has equal responsibility with me for the report of the  Major Airport  Needs of Sydney study, informing him that I think 14 December is an appropriate date for the study to report to both the New South Wales Minister and me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also look forward to consultations with my colleague, the New South Wales Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Mr Landa,  so that the two Governments can settle down and rationally provide a proper solution to take away all of the concerns of the people of Sydney- that is those who might be affected by any changes- and also to get a proper development so that the future needs of Sydney are properly planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- For the information of honourable members I wish to make a statement on action taken so far by the Government on the recommendations on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation following that Committee’s inquiry into off-road vehicles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation resolved in September 1975 to inquire into the impact of off-road vehicles on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly true in the case of recreation vehicles, where the behaviour of individual riders and drivers is critical to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this, the Government has been especially concerned to implement the Committee’s recommendations aimed at promoting environmental awareness in recreation vehicle users. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been made for showing to recreation vehicle clubs, schools, <span class="highlight">environment</span> centres and all groups which have an interest in recreation vehicles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The name ‘recreation vehicle’ is preferred to the term ‘off-road vehicle’ which I believe encourages a use of vehicles which are intrinsically damaging to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was absorbed into the odds and sods department, namely, the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us be clear where this Government stands in relation to <span class="highlight">environment</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Environmental management and the impact of off-road vehicles on the Australian continent are very serious problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are matters which create problems for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article outlines the basic conflict between the use of off-road vehicles and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and environmental qualities in urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, there is the damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> itself- the damage to ground vegetation and to beach and foreshore areas, the destruction of wilderness areas and reserves, and the erosion problem overall in all those cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I find it rather regrettable that six of the 15 recommendations put forward in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation- a report that took some 18 months to bring down, a report that took a great deal of effort by the Committee’s members, together with submissions from any organisations- did not even rate a mention in the Minister’s response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A key part of the evaluation of the measures that need to be taken to maintain the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and thereby make the use of these vehicles compatible with the management and preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> does not rate a mention by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Publishing Service, however, does not operate in a completely commercial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with what the Minister said about the Publishing Service not operating in a completely commercial <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-22-194">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, I present the report of the Committee entitled ‘Environmental Protection, Adequacy of Legislative and Administrative Arrangements, First Report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report deals with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally, the Committee had hoped to examine the overall needs for environmental protection in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is a major mechanism available to the Commonwealth to identify, evaluate and co-ordinate direct and indirect impacts of Commonwealth decisions on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Act is to ensure that those responsible for developing proposals and those responsible for taking decisions on those proposals think about and take account of environmental factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee noted in its report on the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> that the Act places proposals under scrutiny to a much greater degree and this has led to tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Departments responsible for these activities have a good working relationship with the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and appear to fulfil the obligations placed upon them by the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there are a number of departments which are not happy with the legislation and it is apparent that, while some of these departments co-operate reluctantly with the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, others use the discretion allowed under the Act to avoid referring any proposals to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To help overcome these tensions and administrative inefficiencies and to ensure departments observe the spirit of the legislation, the Committee has recommended that memoranda of understanding be agreed to between the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Webster) and other Ministers which would provide broad guidelines on the question of environmental significance and matters which should be referred for advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a balance to the greater autonomy of departments provided by memoranda, the Committee has recommended that the Act be amended to allow the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to request and be provided with information on proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recognises the responsibility of the States in environmental protection and believes that the Act should be amended to acknowledge the States’ role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One method would be to amend the Act to give the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> discretion in the application of the Act if proposals have been subject to State procedures and that the State procedures are considered to satisfy the provisions of the Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee notes that Victoria is the only State which, at present, has comprehensive <span class="highlight">environment</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the Commonwealth should encourage other States to adopt legislation similar to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council consider the need to introduce in each State legislation similar to the Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report emphasises that there is a need for the Commonwealth to maintain powers that would enable it to intervene in environmental matters of national concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the States do adopt legislation similar to the Commonwealth’s the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act must remain to allow in some instances independent Commonwealth assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I commend the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation for his report and say that I was proud to have worked with this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation that has been confirmedthe <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975- has been given a great deal of publicity, particularly in economic journals, because it has been anticipated that pressures particularly from mining companies would lead to a watering down, if not the complete abolition, of legislation of this type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we received evidence from some of the mining companies- they put the view forward that all environmental matters ought to be the responsibility of the States- I think we were all suspicious of the fact that their enthusiasm for ending Commonwealth involvement in environmental matters was because one or two of the States in particular seemed to give the Australian mining companies almost a totally free go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government realises that it was considered by eight members from different parties who came up with very sensible solutions to some of the problems, and that there will not be any diminution- other than what is recommended in this report- of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that on a matter which is of significance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation in Australia that those who have been involved in an extensive survey of existing legislation are given such limited time to speak on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to some of the recommendations in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They emphasise the intent of the Committee that environmental and conservation considerations be discussed openly and without the privacy of government inquiries and government departmental actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>12 states that the Minister should provide details of the reasons why a direction on an environmental impact statement on particular proposals is not given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those recommendations show just where the Committee believes amendments should be made to allow greater public participation and discussion on matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Conservation Foundation was extremely helpful, as it always is in inquiries by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I get a little tired of those who seek to use the ACF as a whipping-boy for anti-conservation and anti-environmental outbursts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that then we will be able to say that at least in the decade leading up to that 200th anniversary the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament have done something to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to conserve this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I too would like to comment on the role of the  Chairman  and the staff of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were pressures on the Government, particularly from the Australian Mining Industry Council and its affiliates, for quite drastic changes in relation to environmental legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Government itself there were signs of considerable pressures to the extent that extremely important departments such as the Department of the Treasury and the Department of National Development- critical departments in terms of their interests in and their management of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- were extremely reluctant to appear before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer briefly to a further agreement by Committee members that the Commonwealth has a direct and continuing responsibility in relation to preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> across Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We received evidence and were aware of the fact that in Australia at the present time a number of major projects which are of very great environmental significance are being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly those projects which are capital intensive and energy intensive must have a massive effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the broadest sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those mining projects are important environmentally for several reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise this point because it illustrates the development of our understanding of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for that reason it is important to refer to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have to understand that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> concerns not simply the matter of protecting trees and rare species but it involves the survival of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> is fragile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Committee’s report drawing attention to those issues opens up an area of <span class="highlight">environment</span> inquiry that ought to be pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is significant for three major reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two pieces of legislation under consideration are the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will make few comments on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act except to say that the Committee fully recognises the role of the State governments and their environmental responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it also recognises the contribution that this Act has had in developing industry awareness, government awareness at the three levels of government and a public awareness of this nation’s resources and the need for their exploitation under conditions that ensure adequate environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to take full consideration of this report and the implications if any major decisions that would not result in the effective management of Australia ‘s natural resources or of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> were implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much emphasis was placed by some witnesses on the damage by the mining industry to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly the damage in the Darling Ranges of Western Australia by the mining industry and the bauxite industry and the general damage to forest areas surrounding such mining areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somewhat less emphasis was placed on the damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in that area by the effects of farming and urban development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth involvement in environmental protection be restricted to geographic areas under the direct control of the Commonwealth (e.g., Commonwealth Territories), Commonwealth works and activities, activities which the States have referred to the Commonwealth and matters considered by the Commonwealth Government to be of national significance-, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act should be implemented with common sense and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I believe that local government and the State governments today have a much greater awareness of environmental issues than they had a few years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this has been largely brought about by the sensible use of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>R;/ BAILLIEU (La Trobe)-by leave-Being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, I appreciate the opportunity of having a couple of minutes in which to make some comments on the Committee’s report and its inquiry into the environmental protection legislation of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to say to this House of Parliament that I am getting tired, as a member of parliament, of having to deal with unemployed people who, by reason of government policies, are being driven to the point where we now have more and more suicides, where more and more people are getting hooked on drugs, more and more marriages are breaking up, and more and more people are lacking any capacity to relate to people in the most basic sense let alone relate to a working <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The authors of those two reports are presumably referring to several sentences in the published report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation entitled ‘Environmental Protection: Adequacy of Legislative and Administrative Arrangements’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This afternoon the honourable member for Batman  (Mr Howe)  raised as a matter of privilege the alleged refusal of the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury to answer certain questions in a questionnaire forwarded by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in relation to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 21 February 1979 the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  wrote to the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  inviting a submission from the Department of the Treasury in relation to the Committee’s inquiry into Environmental Protection- Adequacy of Legislative and Administrative Arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latter half of the 1970s must accordingly be seen as a period in which the Commonwealth has forced the States to allow the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> to deteriorate and the extension of services in rural areas to be curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extraordinary that someone who has come out of such a fine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from such a fine school in the western suburbs, should have degenerated so much and that someone else who has come out of the same <span class="highlight">environment</span> should have flourished and will soon be Labor Treasurer of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation was tabled on 1 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee can only conclude that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has no perception as to the relationship between its activities and their impact on the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many quotes similar to that where the findings of the Committee were that it was a serious matter and the Parliament ought to consider whether in fact there was any sensibility whatsoever with a number of departments which were making decisions affecting the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very point of the House of Representatives Estimates committee’s recommendations was that unless there is a department with the active responsibility of ensuring co-ordination between those departments their perceptions will be far too narrow and decisions will be taken with adverse impacts upon the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of very great importance to the development of our cities and towns that the Government read and reread the report on the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that it take note of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘disarmament’ is most usefully seen as shorthand for ‘disarmament and arms control’, and covering a wide range of activities which could be put under these six headings: Firstly, the negotiations between the superpowers to control nuclear armaments and otherwise limit or control the development of the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> or particular weapon systems; secondly, the discussions in international organisations, particularly at the United Nations, among wider groups of countries to seek the elimination, or ban the use of, particular categories of weapons; thirdly, the diplomatic conferences sponsored by the International Committee of the Red Cross to improve international law relating to humanitarian rights in armed conflict; fourthly, the various activities underway to prevent the diversion of nuclear material to military or explosive use; fifthly, regional negotiations to secure limitations to or a reduction of force levels, or to establish procedures for war avoidance; and finally, unilateral actions by countries to shape their defence forces and their diplomatic posture to diminish the prospects of conflict and enable reallocation of national resources in their region to social purposes rather than military expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become clear during recent days that fears stressed earlier this year about the future of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">environment</span> legislation are correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  is leading a Cabinet vendetta against environmental protection legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with his hatchetman, the Treasurer  (Mr Howard),  he has been proposing to amend Commonwealth legislation in order to exempt such major items as foreign investment from scrutiny under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and to hand over all responsibility for <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection to the States, except that relating to Commonwealth projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign has been carried out behind a veil of Cabinet and departmental secrecy at the same time as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation was publicly investigating the same subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have read the documents could have come to the conclusion only that the Commonwealth was preparing to water down environmental controls and hand over virtually all its responsibilities in this field to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement that was typical of the deception, deceit and doubletalk that has highlighted the term of office of the Fraser Government, he said in the next breath that all that was going to happen was that the Government would hand over to the States the responsibility for environmental matters- that is, all those projects for which the Federal Government has no direct responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, unless a Federal Government department is directly involved in building a project, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act will not be invoked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in its report and the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in his memorandum of 11 June, have stated that only one State, Victoria, has comprehensive environmental protection legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> would be the loser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister has stated that he would like to have environmental laws more simply administered than they are at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer seems to have a similar callous record in respect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday morning’s Melbourne  Age  observed that even if there is foreign investment in the Rundle oil shale deposit, the project is likely to escape an environmental study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, amendments foreshadowed by the Deputy Prime Minister would give responsibility for safeguarding the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to that great environmentalist, the Queensland Minister for Mines and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new procedures do not include public participation and environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation made specific recommendations in relation to State and Federal participation in <span class="highlight">environment</span> assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 be amended to give the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> discretion in the application of the Act if proposals have been subject to State procedures and that the State assessments of the proposals satisfy the provisions of the Commonwealth Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council consider the need to introduce in each State, legislation similar to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, its procedures and the administrative arrangements with the States should not be amended in a manner which would preclude an independent assessment of proposals being undertaken by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victoria is the only State which has comprehensive environmental legislation although legislation is currently before the New South Wales Parliament and is in the process of being drafted in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee believes that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 is the most effective means yet developed to ensure the broad examination of proposals and alternatives and to enable full community involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should encourage those States without environmental legislation to adopt legislation similar to the Impact of Proposals Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These same departments were also reluctant to provide the Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation with detailed evidence concerning the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is these departments which are involved in foreign investment ventures, such as mining, which obviously can have marked effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on 23 November 1978, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They probably are, knowing the honourable member’s failure to worry about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore must carry out a crusade to gain exemption from the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as its Minister has a blinkered approach to government, so too is the Treasury blinded to the long term social and environmental consequences of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A memorandum, prepared by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on 1 1 June this year for the Cabinet review, shows not only that other departments are attacking the Act but also that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who administers the Act, is finding ways to subvert the spirit if not the letter of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposed to take environmental assessment out of the public domain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change would facilitate the ability of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Minister to take action to conclude his environmental consideration of many proposals without having to resort to directing an impact statement and subjecting the matter concerned to public review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we will ensure in development projects, which are likely to have a significant and/or damaging effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and involving the Commonwealth, that Environmental Impact Statements are prepared prior to decisions having been made . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems ridiculous that the Minister should seek to change the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act so that no impact statement need be prepared, since in the past financial year only two environmental impact statements have been ordered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976-77 and in 1977-78, 34 environmental impact statements were ordered by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1975, 3,230 proposals regarded as environmentally significant have been put forward, but only 50 of those proposals have needed environmental impact statements to be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee recommended:  the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act be amended to require the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to provide, on request, details of the reasons for not directing an Environmental Impact Statement on particular proposals considered to be of environmental significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is a model for the States to follow in environmental legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has a responsibility to provide a lead to the States and the Cabinet must not abrogate this responsibility by destroying the Act and reverting back to the dark days of the 1960s when the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was up for rape and pillage by every form of development that was going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject that he has put up for discussion is ‘the Government’s stated intention to hand over to the States certain areas of responsibility for <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the Government has not stated an intention to absolve itself from the area of environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has a record second to none in the area of environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has made achievements in the area of environmental protection- not just nonsense, not just scatter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act also requires environmental impact statements to be prepared in respect of developments outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What Australian Government or political party would have the pretence to suggest that it should make an environmental impact assessment into development proposals in a foreign country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a question of walking away from environmental issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Budget the Government has also recognised the need for industry to be highly innovative and technologically advanced if it is to compete effectively in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the 1980s, hence funding for industral research and development assistance has been increased by 33 per cent, following a 75 per cent increase last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Exhaustive studies were carried out by the Department of Transport after the October 1977 crash to determine what caused the problems that arose and how the deficiencies in the drainage system could be overcome to prevent dangerous liquids that enter the drainage system from the street gutters, outside Mascot airport from traversing the airport <span class="highlight">environment</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we are seeking three principal objectives: Firstly, economic growth and higher national prosperity, particularly through the provision of an efficient service to industry, commerce and agriculture, secondly, the meeting of social needs through securing a reasonable level of personal mobility; and thirdly, the minimising of the harmful effects in loss of life and damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that are often the direct physical result of the transport we use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, the environmental constraints on transport systems, long not understood, are now being seen increasingly to be critically important limiting factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly we have pursued a policy of gradualism in respect of tariff reductions and, where appropriate, have provided for reductions to be phased in so that industry has advance warning of those changes and time to adapt to operating in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of lower levels of protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
